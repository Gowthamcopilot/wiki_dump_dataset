0,23251,75642176,18462,Happy Asmara,"Heppy Rismanda Hendranata (; born July 10, 1999), better known by the stage name Happy Asmara is an Indonesian singer-songwriter, presenter, and businessperson from Ringinrejo, Kediri. Based herself in Javanese music, her name gained wider public attention after the release of the second single of her own production titled ""Tak Ikhlasno"" which has gained immense popularity in the Java region, specifically East Java. In the year of the release of ""Tak Ikhlasno"", Happy Asmara through the record label released the recycled single ""Dalan Liyane"" which also gained great popularity and at least became a change in her career. In popular culture, ""Tak Ikhlasno"" and ""Dalan Liyane"" have been considered the beginnings of great recognition.

 Early life and education 
Happy Asmara was born in Ringinrejo, Kediri and grew up in the Ringinrejo District area. She is the eldest of four children from a Javanese-Minahasan father, Hendro Siswantoro, and a Javanese mother, Dwi Yuslianti. Happy Asmara has three younger siblings; the oldest is Riang Cahya Fortuna and the youngest is Alexio Bertrand Alvaro, while her second younger brother is a person with autism and has died from tetanus. Happy's last name is a patronymic name given by her parents, which was adapted from her father's first name.

Happy Asmara has completed her junior high school education from SMP Negeri 2 Kras, then she continued and has completed her senior high school education from SMA Negeri 1 Kandat in Kediri Regency, East Java. Happy Asmara had pursued a Bachelor of Education (S.Pd.) degree in Primary School Teacher Education (PGSD) from the Open University (UPBJJ-UT) Malang in Kediri City, but due to her busy career she finally chose to stop until an unspecified time.

 Career 

 2009, 2013 - 2016: Early career 
In 2009, when Happy Asmara was between the ages of 8 and 10, she started her career by being selected as a model for a local children's magazine in East Java. As time went by, Happy's talent in singing began to show, she had been training her vocals since she was in junior high school. Happy Asmara began her musical career by appearing from stage to stage, starting from local festivals, filling weddings, to appearing as a sinden in wayang kulit events.

In 2013, Happy Asmara began signing a contract with a local record company and a few years later she began joining several dangdut orchestras at once in East Java. Happy Asmara released her debut single on January 1, 2014 with a live recording of the title track ""Sayang 4"". Throughout her career, Happy Asmara worked as a vocalist for a local indie band in Kediri, at the same time she was also a rocker singer with a punk fashion style.

 2016 - 2017: Dangdut Academy 4 Surabaya audition 
While still a high school student in 2016, Happy Asmara was supported by her parents to audition for the fourth season of the popular dangdut singing talent search D'Academy at BK3S Tenggilis Mejoyo in Surabaya, the audition was held on November 7 2016 and was broadcast delayed by Indosiar on January 18, 2017. In the audition assessment round, Happy Asmara sang several lyrics from the song ""Sayang"" which was popularized by Via Vallen, Nassar Sungkar, Dewi Persik, and Iis Dahlia became the main panel of judges assessing her performance. At the end of the audition, Happy Asmara managed to get a golden ticket which was given directly by Dewi Persik as the main panel of judges. After the audition round was over, Happy Asmara was considered to have resigned and was also declared to have failed to advance to the next round. This happened because she did not answer the phone call from the organizers informing her that she had been selected to compete in Jakarta for fear of fraud.

5,4641,75115723,17025,Hmong sausage,"Hmong sausage (Hmong: ) is a long thick pork sausage from Hmong culture seasoned with herbs like lemongrass and Thai chili pepper. The sausage is popular during Hmong New Year celebrations. The exact recipe varies depending on factors such as clan and individual immigration background.

Hmong being a diaspora incorporate a wide variety of ingredients, methods, and cultural backgrounds in Hmong cuisine such as Hmong sausage. There is no standard recipe for Hmong sausage, but the key ingredients are coarse ground fatty pork cuts such as pork belly and pork shoulder, Thai chili peppers, lemongrass, Kaffir lime leaf or lime juice, and fresh ginger root or galangal. Other common ingredients are salt, black pepper, garlic, scallions, shallots, fish sauce, oyster sauce, cilantro, green onion, Serrano pepper, and monosodium glutamate (MSG). Fresh aromatic herbs are prioritized for flavor and are visible under the sausage casing.  One commercial producer sells a number of popular variations: original (no chilies), spicy (with chilies), ginger, made with pork blood, and ""egg roll-style"" made with vermicelli noodles and other egg roll fillings.

The sausage is usually sold and served fresh, although some variations are lightly fermented or cured. Commercial outlets ship the sausage frozen.

Hmong sausage is typically grilled at a low heat and served as large slices with steamed white rice or purple sticky rice, another signature Hmong dish, pan fried with blanched cabbage, or with pho soup. Sour and spicy sauces are served on the side, especially a Hmong sauce made with Thai chilies called ""pepper dip"". Reflecting the diverse backgrounds of Hmong people, some restaurants offer ""Thai-style"" or ""Lao-style"" preparations. The sausage is widely available in Hmong communities at restaurants, butchers, and delis. One Hmong American grocery store processed and sold about 700 pounds of Hmong sausage daily.

 Culture 
Many Hmong Americans express that making and eating traditional Hmong foods such as sausage connects them to their identity and family history. About Hmong sausage in relation to the difficult background of Hmong immigrants, Minnesota Hmong American chef Yia Vang said: ""This sausage is redemption... I’m proud of it... I’m not ashamed anymore. This shit is legacy.""

Hmong sausage is commonly processed and served during special occasions like Hmong New Year celebrations. Hmong American families tend to make the sausage in large batches with common American processing equipment such as sausage stuffing machines and synthetic sausage casing, although historically and in other Hmong diasporas across the world the sausage is produced by hand, frequently in small batches. Chef Yia Vang remembered his father teaching him to coarsely chop pork by hand and stuff it into intestine casing with a modified Coca-Cola bottle. Similarly, Wisconsin Hmong American chef Diane Moua recalled: ""I remember vividly my grandma making Hmong sausage. I called my mom, because I wasn't sure, but I remember as a kid she chopped it up and put it in this casing...""

Hmong Americans tend to make the sausage a foot or more long and very thick, then eat it fresh or freeze it to preserve it. Some families prefer shorter sausages. Others prefer to lightly ferment or smoke the sausage for flavor and preservation.

Hmong families pass down ""secret"" sausage recipes and don't disclose the exact ingredients or methods they use. In Cooking from the Heart: The Hmong Kitchen in America (2023), an authoritative Hmong American cookbook, the authors say: ""Good cooks guard their sausage recipes, and everyone makes sausage a little differently."" La Vang-Herr, proprietor of @La's, a Hmong food cart in Aloha, Oregon, declined to share their recipe and revealed only that the main ingredients of their sausage are ""juicy ground pork and aromatics like ginger and lemongrass"".

 Commercial preparation 
Hmong sausage has been commercially produced in the United States. Union Hmong Kitchen debuted at the Minnesota State Fair in 2022 with dishes such as purple sticky rice and Hmong sausage made with crunchy Thai chili oil, and began serving the sausage at Target Field in 2023. Kramarczuk's, a James Beard Award-winning Ukrainian deli in Minneapolis, makes and sells Union Hmong Kitchen branded Hmong sausage. Discussing Yia Vang's restaurants, Minnesota Monthly listed Hmong sausage as one of Minnesota's most iconic foods.

In popular culture
 Food critic Andrew Zimmern featured the popular Hmong sausage with purple sticky rice meal at Hmongtown Marketplace on Bizarre Foods: Delicious Destinations in 2016.
 In YA novel Sunny G's Series of Rash Decisions, the main character insists he is ""willing to die for this sausage now that he has not-so-subtly insinuated he thinks I can't handle it"" when told it's ""Hmong-level spicy.""
 Yia Vang mentioned Hmong sausage as part of his background in the opening of Iron Chef: Quest for an Iron Legend episode six, ""Battle Chili Peppers"".",2025-04-01,"['Hmong cuisine' 'Sausages' 'Cuisine of Minnesota' 'Lao sausages'

6,30803,75858003,23376,Chronic meningitis,"Chronic meningitis is a long-lasting inflammation of the membranes lining the brain and spinal cord (known as the meninges). By definition, the duration of signs, symptoms and inflammation in chronic meningitis last longer than 4 weeks. Infectious causes (due to bacteria, fungi and viruses) are a leading cause and the infectious organisms responsible for chronic meningitis are different than the organisms that cause acute infectious meningitis. Tuberculosis and the fungi cryptococcus are leading causes worldwide. Chronic meningitis due to infectious causes are more common in those who are immunosuppressed, including those with HIV infection or in children who are malnourished. Chronic meningitis sometimes has a more insidious course than acute meningitis. Also, some of the infectious agents that cause chronic infectious meningitis such as mycobacterium tuberculosis, many fungal species and viruses are difficult to isolate from the cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord) making diagnosis challenging. No cause is identified during initial evaluation in one third of cases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is more sensitive than computed tomography (CT scan) and may show radiological signs that suggest chronic meningitis, however no radiological signs are considered pathognomonic or characteristic. MRI is also normal in many cases further limiting its diagnostic utility.

Worldwide, tuberculosis meningitis is a leading cause of disability and death, with central nervous system tuberculosis (with tuberculosis meningitis being the most common type) occurring in 5-10% of all cases of extrapulmonary tuberculosis and 1% of all cases of tuberculosis overall. Cryptococcal meningitis is also a major cause of death and disability worldwide, especially in areas where HIV and AIDS are more common, accounting for more than 100,000 yearly deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa. Cryptococcal meningitis accounts for about 68% of meningitis cases in those with HIV and has a mortality rate of 10-25%, with delays in diagnosis and treatment being especially common and associated with a poor prognosis. The treatment for chronic infectious meningitis is directed at the underlying infectious agent.

 Signs and symptoms 
Some of the possible symptoms of chronic meningitis (due to any cause) include headache, nausea and vomiting, fever, and visual impairment. Nuchal rigidity (or neck stiffness with discomfort in trying to move the neck), a classic symptom in acute meningitis, was seen in only 45% of cases of chronic meningitis with the sign being even more rare in non-infectious causes. Other signs associated with chronic meningitis include altered mental status or confusion, and papillary edema (swelling of the optic disc).

The headache in chronic meningitis is commonly described as diffuse, poorly localized, and constant. Lethargy is a common symptom, with 40% of those having mental status changes. The inflammation can affect the cranial nerves as they course through the subarachnoid space leading to cranial nerve palsies. Nerve roots may also be affected in chronic meningitis leading to radiculopathy.

 Cause 
The causes of chronic infectious meningitis are different than those of acute infectious meningitis. Worldwide, the fungi cryptococcus and tuberculosis are leading infectious causes. Immunosuppression (due to a variety of causes) is a major risk factor for the development of chronic infectious meningitis, with Cryptococcus meningitis (which is transmitted by inhalation of fungal spores) being the most common cause of chronic meningitis in those who are immunosuppressed. Worldwide, HIV and AIDS (which are characterized by immunosuppression) are major risk factors for the development of chronic infectious meningitis. Diabetes, recent ear surgery or neurosurgery, and the presence of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt are other risk factors for the development of chronic infectious meningitis. Other fungi that are ubiquitously found in the environment (either in certain regions of the world or globally) are also known causes. These fungi include coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, aspergillus and cryptococcus gattii (which may also cause chronic meningitis in those with normal immune function).

In 2012-2013, an outbreak of fungal meningitis in the United States linked to contaminated steroids designated for epidural spinal injections led to the development of meningitis in about 800 people and more than 100 deaths.

The most common bacterial causes of chronic meningitis include tuberculosis and treponema pallidum (neurosyphillis). Other bacterial causes include leptospirosis and brucellosis. HIV is a potential viral cause. HIV leads to immunosuppression and subsequent chronic infectious meningitis by a variety of potential opportunistic organisms, however the HIV itself may also cause infectious meningitis, usually during the initial phase of HIV infection. Herpes simplex virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus are other viruses that may cause chronic meningitis.

Non-infectious causes of chronic meningitis include potential etiologies that cause meningeal irritation, such as medications, inflammatory diseases, auto-immune diseases and cancer. Chemical inflammation of the meninges may be due to Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs (most commonly with ibuprofen), immunoglobulin therapy, anti-microbials (such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole), immunosuppressants, chemotherapy and anticonvulsants (most commonly lamotrigine and carbamazepine). Auto-immune diseases such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis or Sjogren syndrome may cause inflammation of the meningitis. Various inflammatory conditions such as neurosarcoidosis, IgG4 related pachymeningitis or leptomeningitis are also known causes of chronic meningitis. Carcinomatous meningitis involves meningeal inflammation due to cancer spread to the meninges. The types of cancers that are most commonly associated with meningeal spread include breast and lung cancer, melanoma skin cancer, lymphomas, and leukemia. Dermoid cysts near the brain or spinal cord, a type of cyst containing developmentally mature tissue, may leak their contents into the subarachnoid space thus leading to meningeal inflammation.

 Pathophysiology 
The pathogenesis of tuberculosis meningitis involves mycobacterium tuberculosis being shed into the environment via respiratory droplets from an infected person. These droplets are then inhaled to the lungs where the mycobacterium tuberculosis is phagocytosed by macrophages as part of the Th1-helper T cell response and a granuloma forms. Either via disseminated tuberculosis or by other means, some tubercula gain access to the meninges. Small foci of tuberculous bacilli, known as Rich foci, deposit in the brain, meninges, and spinal cord. The tuberculosis bacilli then gain access to the subarachnoid space via the Rich foci and begin the process of meningeal inflammation characteristic of tuberculosis meningitis.

Cryptococcus species (cryptococcus gatti and neoformans) have a polysaccharide capsule surrounding the yeasts to shield the yeast from immune system killing. Cryptococcus also has a cell wall laccase, a copper-containing cell wall enzyme that increases the release of dopamine and prostaglandin E2 inflammatory markers in humans to increase inflammation.

 Diagnosis 
Chronic meningitis is defined by signs and symptoms being present longer than four weeks and includes pleocytosis, or the presence of inflammatory cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. The initial test is usually a lumbar puncture to collect cerebrospinal fluid for analysis. The lumbar puncture in chronic meningitis usually shows a lymphocytic predominant inflammatory pattern, however, some infectious agents such as early tuberculosis meningitis, nocardia or brucella may have an neutrophilic predominant inflammation. A eosinophilic predominant inflammation may be seen with some parasites that cause chronic infectious meningitis. The content of protein and glucose in the cerebrospinal fluid also varies depending on the etiology. Many of the organisms responsible for chronic infectious meningitis (especially mycobacterium tuberculosis and most types of fungi) are difficult to grow on culture making diagnosis especially difficult. Large volume lumbar punctures (obtaining more than 10 mL of cerebrospinal fluid) or multiple lumbar punctures may increase diagnostic yield. Serologic testing of the cerebrospinal fluid or blood (testing for specific antibodies or antigens related to an infectious organism) may aid in the diagnosis and is available for infectious causes such as HIV, syphilis, and Lyme disease. Nucleic acid amplification or PCR of the cerebrospinal fluid may also assist in identifying a causative organism. PCR specific to bacterial RNA (16S ribosomal RNA) or fungal RNA (18S ribosomal RNA) further aids in identifying the causative organism. Metagenomic sequencing has been used to detect a wide variety of genetic material in a sample (rather than testing for specific predetermined organisms with PCR) of the cerebrospinal fluid and aids in the identification of infectious causes of chronic meningitis that are difficult to isolate by conventional methods. The clinical relevance of detected genetic material in the pathology of chronic infectious meningitis can be further confirmed by comparing the metagenomic genetic material to controls from healthy individuals.

MRI of the brain with contrast may show enhancement of the meninges and the subarachnoid space however MRI may also be normal. MRI is the preferred neuroimaging test to diagnose chronic meningitis, being more sensitive than CT of the brain, however, MRI scanners are not available in many resource-limited settings where chronic infectious meningitis is prevalent.

Brain biopsy is considered a second-line test, that is usually utilized when first-line testing fails to identify a cause. Brain biopsy has increased diagnostic yield when highly enhancing brain or meningeal areas on MRI are biopsied.

 Treatment 
Initial diagnostic evaluation often fails to identify a causative organism in chronic infectious meningitis and empirical therapy may be initiated to prevent significant disability or death. Empiric therapy is indicated in those who are immunocompromised or who are neutropenic. In those who are immune-competent, empiric therapy is less well-established and is usually initiated on a case-by-case basis. In those who undergo empirical therapy, treatment involves anti-tuberculosis therapy combined with steroids in areas where tuberculosis is endemic. Anti-fungal empirical therapy is also commonly employed due to fungi's ubiquitous presence and ability to cause opportunistic infections in those who are immunosuppressed. When a causative organism is identified then anti-microbial therapy is targeted specifically to that organism.

Treatment of tuberculosis meningitis consists of a 2-month induction regiment with isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol followed by an extended course (often 7-10 months) of isoniazid and rifampin as maintenance therapy. Isoniazid and pyrazinamide can cross the blood-brain barrier. However the duration of maintenance treatment is assumed based on experience with pulmonary tuberculosis, and the optimal duration of therapy in tuberculosis meningitis is not well established. Steroid co-administration is thought to improve outcomes. There is a paucity of information regarding the optimal treatment regiment for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis meningitis (which is by definition resistant to isoniazid and rifampin), but fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides can achieve adequate brain and spinal cord penetration and are often used.

The World Health Organization recommends a screen and treat approach to diagnose cryptococcal meningitis in those with HIV. All HIV-positive people with low CD4+ T cells should undergo cryptococcal serum antigen testing. Those who screen positive for serum cryptococcal antigen should undergo a lumbar puncture followed by treatment if the cerebrospinal fluid contains cryptococcus. Those who cannot undergo a lumbar puncture but screen positive for cryptococcal antigen in the serum should be presumptively treated. Cryptococcal meningitis is treated with 2 weeks of induction therapy using the antifungals amphotericin B and flucytosine followed by 8 weeks of induction therapy with fluconazole and then a prolonged duration (at least one year) of lower dose maintenance fluconazole therapy. Lifelong treatment is required in those with AIDS, however, in those who begin anti-retroviral therapy and have CD4 T-cells above 200, therapy can be stopped. Steroid co-therapy is not indicated in cryptococcal meningitis and may worsen outcomes and delay recovery.

Hydrocephalus is a common complication in chronic infectious meningitis, including tuberculosis and cryptococcal meningitis. In cases of hydrocephalus, intracranial pressure is controlled by serial therapeutic lumbar punctures (often done daily) until opening pressure normalizes. Diuretics such as furosemide or acetazolamide, osmotic agents such as mannitol, external ventricular drainage, or ventriculoperitoneal shunts may also be used in tuberculosis meningitis to control intracranial pressure.

 Prevention 
The BCG vaccine has been shown to lower the risk of developing tuberculosis meningitis in those who become infected with tuberculosis. In children who developed tuberculosis meningitis, those who had the BCG vaccine had milder symptoms and were less likely to die from the disease.

 Prognosis 
The mortality of tuberculosis meningitis is 20-50% even with treatment. A longer duration of presenting symptoms was associated with a higher mortality in tuberculosis meningitis. HIV co-infection, multidrug resistant tuberculosis, or the development of hydrocephalus or focal weakness in tuberculosis meningitis are also associated with a poor prognosis. In those who survive tuberculosis meningitis, 30% have longstanding neurological impairments including seizures, weakness, deafness, blindness, intellectual disability.

The mortality rate in cryptococcal meningitis is 25%. Increased intracranial pressure, co-infection with tuberculosis or cytomegalovirus, elevated neutrophil counts, high fungal burden and hyponatremia is associated with a poor prognosis and increased risk of death in those with cryptococcal meningitis. Increased intracranial pressure is seen in about 50% of those with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis.

 Epidemiology 
Tuberculosis meningitis is more common in children and people who are HIV positive. Cryptococcal meningitis is also more common in those who are HIV positive; with HIV co-infection being present in 95% of cases in low and middle-income countries and 80% of cases in high-income countries. Those who are immunosuppressed due to organ transplantation also have a higher incidence of cryptococcal meningitis.",2025-02-01,"['Inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system' 'Meningitis'

7,39738,76127310,11092,Bruscitti," (; , ; ) is an Italian single-course meal of the Lombard, Piedmontese, and Ticinese cuisines based on finely chopped beef cooked for a long time. It is a typical winter dish and is served with polenta, purée or .

 is originally from the  (municipality) of Busto Arsizio, Lombardy, Italy. Bruscitti is widespread in northwestern Lombardy (Italy), northeastern Piedmont (Italy), and lower Ticino (Switzerland). The dish probably originated in the Middle Ages.

Etymology
In the Lombard language the term  means 'crumbs', referring to the size of the meat, chopped into small pieces.

Description
Based on finely chopped beef and cooked for a long time (from 2 to 4 hours) on a low flame, the other ingredients of the dish are butter, garlic, fennel seeds, and lard or pancetta. At the end of cooking, it is blended with well-structured red wines such as Barbera, Barolo or Nebbiolo. When serving, the  must not be too soupy or too dry. It is a typical winter dish and is served with polenta,  or purée.

For a 100 g serving of bruscitti, the food energy is 112.63 kcal (472 kJ), while nutritional values are 6.73 g of proteins, 4.93 g of fats (of which 2.29 g saturated fatty acids), 1.14 g of fibres, and 10.05 g of carbohydrates (of which 1.21 g sugars).

Geographical diffusion
The dish is widespread in the whole Insubria area, or in the province of Varese (Lombardy), in the Alto Milanese area (Lombardy; particularly in the area of the  (municipality) of Busto Arsizio, where it originates), in the province of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola (Piedmont), and in lower Ticino (Switzerland). 

History

 is originally from the  (municipality) of Busto Arsizio, Lombardy, Italy. It is a dish of the ancient peasant tradition. The dish probably originated in the Middle Ages. The first hypothesis on its origin traces its birth to the use of shreds of beef that remained attached to tanning hides (in fact, many tanneries were active in Busto Arsizio). Another hypothesis on the origin of the dish can be traced back to the total pulping of the bones of the steers, i.e. the recovery of those parts that were discarded from the tables of the richest. Until the Italian economic miracle of the 1950s and 1960s, tougher cuts of the beef were used for , which required longer cooking. Later, more tender cuts began to be used such as the , the , the , and the .

Originally, the less tender or typically discarded parts of beef were used. It was a humble but invigorating dish, which was created with the aim of providing refreshment to the farmers who worked in the fields. The dish was born from the need to cook a dish that would cook very slowly on the embers of the fireplace, without the need for much attention and then be finished off at the end of cooking with a touch of wine. Tradition dictates that the meat is cut into small pieces using a knife so as not to lose its juices.

In 1975 in Busto Arsizio the  ('Bruscitti Magisterium') was founded, an association with the aim of spreading knowledge of local rustic cuisine. On 16 December 2012, the mayor of Busto Arsizio established ""the day of "" ( in Lombard), which occurs every second Thursday in November.

10,35719,76009908,23206,Tapping the Source,"Tapping the Source is a surf noir novel by Kem Nunn published in 1984. It is Nunn's debut novel and tells the story of a young man searching for his missing sister in the dark underbelly of California surf culture. It is widely considered to have pioneered the surf noir subgenre.

The novel has been translated into several languages using alternate titles, such as Wellenjagd (Wave Chasing), Surf City and Huntington Beach.

 Plot 
A stranger in a white Camaro with two surfboards strapped to the top arrives at a service station in the desert town of San Arco, California looking for Ike Tucker. He finds the 18-year-old Ike working there, and tells him three surfers in Huntington Beach – Hound Adams, Frank Baker and Terry Jacobs – had taken Ike's sister, Ellen, to Mexico and mysteriously returned without her. Two years prior, Ellen had run away from San Arco in search of a better life and Ike had not heard from her since. Worried what became of her, Ike goes in search of his missing sister.

Ike travels to the Huntington Beach pier where the stranger said the three names surf each morning. But not knowing what they look like he rents a motel room along the Pacific Coast Highway and over the next few days makes several failed attempts to find them. Taken in by his new lively coastal surroundings, Ike decides to buy a surfboard and learn to surf.

One day by the pier, Ike uses his mechanic skills to fix the Harley-Davidson of local biker Preston Marsh. Preston takes a liking to Ike and hires him to do further repair work on the Harley. After Ike tells Preston his reason for coming to Huntington Beach, Preston warns the teenager to stay away from Hound Adams, whom he later points out to Ike surfing with Terry Jacobs by the pier. Ike eventually learns from Preston's girlfriend, Barbara, that Preston was once best friends with Hound and together they were up-and-coming local surf stars. They were also business partners, opening a surf shop together and branding their surfboards with logos of a flaming wave and the words ""Tapping the Source."" However, the two had a falling out that drove Preston to turn his back on surfing and enlist in the Vietnam War, after which he returned a changed man.

Ike keeps tabs on Hound and Terry Jacobs, following them one night to the surf shop and stumbling upon a meet-up between Preston and Frank Baker in the back alley. All the while Ike continues to progress at surfing. The following day in a rare return to his previous life, Preston takes Ike on a road trip to a secret surf spot located just below a ranch near Santa Barbara. On the last night of their surf trip, Preston is attacked by Terry Jacobs. Ike helps subdue Jacobs so the two can escape.

Three days after their return to Huntington Beach, Preston again fights Jacobs, who later dies from the injuries sustained. In retaliation, Jacobs' Samoan family track Preston down, severely beating him and using a lathe to brutally remove all his fingers. In the interim, Ike starts a relationship with Michelle, a young girl also staying at the motel. Michelle invites Ike to a party where he finally meets Hound. A blond-haired, sunburned guru of the local beach scene, Hound has an appealing allure that Ike finds hard to resist. Ike quickly gets sucked into Hound's seedy enterprises, helping to lure young runaway girls back to the surfer's home for drugs, sex and to be filmed in amateur porn.

Things come to a head when Michelle starts spending time alone with Hound and jealousies arise. Ike spirals out of control. While on a bender he runs into Barbara who informs Ike that Preston, still recovering from his injuries, had told her why Ike had come to Huntington Beach and brought up the name Janet Adams, the sister of Hound. Curious to know more, Barbara finds out that Janet had similarly gone missing on a trip to Mexico with Hound, Preston and the son of a rich Hollywood mogul, Milo Trax. Milo is a playboy who at one time made surf films and as it turns out is the owner of the ranch where Preston had taken Ike to surf.

Hound takes Michelle and Ike to meet Milo and are invited to an end-of-summer party at Trax Ranch. While at the party, Milo gives Michelle some jewelry that Ike instantly recognizes once belonged to his sister Ellen. Ike confronts Hound about Ellen and realizes that she never went to Mexico; something happened to her at the ranch. Realizing they are in trouble Ike tries to escape with Michelle, but before able to they are drugged by Hound and Milo. While doped up, Ike witnesses a cult-like ceremony with robed attendees and Michelle sacrificially laid out naked on a rock altar. Preston unexpectedly disrupts the Satanic scene, wielding a gun and shooting everyone on site, allowing Ike and Michelle to flee to safety.

In the aftermath, Michelle and Ike decide to leave Huntington Beach, separately, with a plan to meet-up again later. Ike attends the funeral of Preston, whose remains were recovered at the ranch. Before departing town, Ike confronts Frank Baker about Frank's meet-up with Preston in the surf shop's alley. Frank confesses that he had told Preston about the murder rituals at Trax Ranch, which explained why the biker went there to save Ike and Michelle from a similar fate. Frank also confides that the stranger in the white Camaro is his brother, who had a thing for Ellen and was misled to confuse Janet's story in Mexico with Ellen's disappearance at the ranch. Inside the surf shop originally started by Hound and Preston, Ike takes a photo of Preston surfing in his prime as a keepsake and uses surf wax to draw out the Tapping the Source logo on the wall before leaving for good.

 Inception 
Kem Nunn's first attempts at writing were short stories based on people he knew from his hometown of Pomona in Los Angeles County. During his 20s, he moved into a converted garage in Newport Beach, performing odd jobs around the area and taking up surfing seriously. Towards the end of these self-proclaimed ""lost years,"" Nunn took writing night classes at nearby Orange Coast College where he showed his stories to a substitute teacher. The teacher recommended Nunn send them to novelist Oakley Hall. At age 30, after enrolling to get his undergraduate degree, Nunn was invited by Hall to sit in on the writing program at UC Irvine and continue to work on what would become the manuscript for Tapping the Source.

Nunn was living in Huntington Beach at the time, which greatly influenced his writing, recalling:Most of Orange County was becoming pretty homogenous and upscale. Huntington Beach was this weird little throwback where there were still biker bars and head shops. This kind of run-down main street very close to the beach. It also struck me that no one had really written about surfing in a realistic way, about what the culture is really like. It had always been Beach Blanket Bingo and Ride the Wild Surf. It was always very Hollywoodized, and no one had set a story in that culture. So that’s what I set out to do... tell it the way it really was.

The inspiration for his main character came from a young Huntington Beach local.[He] turned up one day with a black eye and he had been ‘procuring’ runaway girls for this drug dealer biker who lived in town. This kid was street-tough but also had a sweet, innocent side. A real odd mix of toughness and innocence, he gave me the idea for the character of Ike Tucker, and I began to build the story around the idea of that character.
Nunn has cited The Catcher and the Rye by J.D. Salinger and Dog Soldiers by Robert Stone as influences. Coincidentally, Stone became the writer-in-residence at UC Irvine while Nunn was there. Despite being told by one of the program directors to not even bother reading Nunn's manuscript, Stone liked the novel-in-progress so much he helped to get it published.

Tapping the Source was sold by literary agent Rhoda Weyr to Delacorte Press for $17,500. The novel's opening includes the acknowledgment, ""A special thanks to Oakley Hall for his perseverance on my behalf.""

 Reception 
The year of its release,Tapping the Source won the silver California Book Award for First Fiction and as its author Kem Nunn was a National Book Award finalist for First Work of Fiction.

At the time of the novel's publication, reviews were mixed on the plot but praised Nunn's talent as a budding novelist.The Washington Post described the book as a typical noir thriller containing ""city boys with their dreams of 'tapping the source' through drugs or sex or surfing"" and depicting ""a world that is also fraught with touches of mysticism, as it is in [Robert] Stone and [Joan] Didion."" The review continues by stating ""Nunn stays cooler with tone and calmer with pace than most first novelists"" and ""the book leaves you with a feeling you can savor for days,"" though critiques that when it comes to surfing and Harleys ""Nunn seems to know what he's talking about [...] but when he introduces full-bore evil in the form of a rich guy who's into kinky sex and ritual murder, authenticity wavers"" before finally conceding that ""he may not yet have proved himself a master of the genre, but he has made his mark."" Kirkus Reviews stated that ""Nunn demonstrates promising talent here – in stretches of quietly forceful narration"" but criticizes that ""he brings insufficient freshness, however, to a familiar, dated loss-of-innocence scenario – with the themes flatly announced at regular intervals."" Writing for The New York Times, Wendy Lesser praised the portrayal of the main character but states ""Ike alone is not enough to compensate for the novel's stale plot or its two-dimensional supporting characters, but he does make you want to keep an eye on Kem Nunn, who may well turn out to be a good storyteller once he finds a good story."" Perhaps most glowingly, Frank Gannon of the Saturday Review proclaimed ""what Hemingway’s Nick Adams did for fishing, Kem Nunn does for surfing.""

Considered only a moderate commercial success upon its initial release, selling fewer than 10,000 copies, Tapping the Source has become highly regarded as a ""surf noir masterpiece"" and earned a cult following, with some surf shops having adopted the name. Upon subsequent reprints, online review sites like Crime Fiction Lover and The Rap Sheet heralded it as ""one of the great American noir novels"" and a ""book you have to read,"" respectively.

 Film Adaptations 

Shortly after its publication, the film rights to Tapping the Source were purchased by Martin Bregman at Universal Pictures, who was known for producing Scarface, Dog Day Afternoon and later Carlito's Way. The adaption went through eight rewrites by screenwriter Ron Koslow with Oscar-nominee Michael Apted set to direct at one point. In 2006, the son of Martin, Michael Bregman tried to revive the project, writing a 125-page revision with David Ellis attached to direct. The film was never made, but the rights deal earned Nunn considerably more than the book's royalties and allowed him to write his follow-up novel, Unassigned Territory.

In 2019, it was reported that screenwriter Martin Helgeland was adapting the novel, overseen by Universal's Executive Vice President of Production, Matt Reilly, with Nunn also set to produce.

It has been commonly cited that the 1991 film Point Break was inspired by Tapping the Source. Asked whether the sale of the book's film rights was the origin of Point Break, Kem Nunn responded:It’s not exactly right, but that’s the story you hear get told a lot! [...] somebody sent me a script, Point Break was originally titled Johnny Utah, and said they’re ripping off your story. But I said that it’s not really my story anymore, talk to Marty Bergman, as Universal now own the film rights. But in my mind the only inter connection is a guy trying to infiltrate the surfer world to find out something. I don’t think there’s too much of a connection between my book and that movie, but it gets mentioned all the time.Point Break was produced by Largo Entertainment and written by W. Paul Iliff based on a story idea by Rick King. While there are some similarities between the plots, as well as the film's characterization of Patrick Swayze's Bodhi to the book's character Hound Adams, neither King nor Iliff have ever publicly stated they drew inspiration from the book.",2025-03-29,"['Delacorte Press books' '1984 debut novels' '1984 American novels'

13,249,74986502,17624,"Notre-Dame-du-Travail, Paris","Notre-Dame-du-Travail (also known as Notre-Dame-du-Travail de Plaisance) is a Roman Catholic church located at 59 rue Vercingetorix in the 14th arrondissement of Paris. It was built between 1897 and 1902 for the largely working-class population of the Plaisance neighborhood. It is notable particularly for its exposed steel framework in the interior, resembling a factory, in contrast to the more traditional exterior. The entire church was registered as an historic monument on July 5, 2016.

 History 
A small chapel built in 1848, had preceded the present church, when the village was still just outside the city limits of Paris, surrounded by wheat fields. and had a population of two thousand. After the Gare de l'Ouest railway station (now Gare Montparnasse) was built, the neighborhood was renamed Plaisance, and became an industrial center, and the working class population grew rapidly. The Plaisance parish was annexed to Paris in 1860, and, as the population grew, the chapel was enlarged with a third traverse. In 1870, when the city was besieged by the Prussians during the Franco-Prussian War, the church was used as a hospital. During the Paris Commune in 1871, the church was briefly confiscated and the priest imprisoned.""Guide de visite, Notre-Dame-du Travail""

As the population of the neighborhood grew, the church was soon overcrowded. In 1884 the vicar, Father Roger Soulange-Bodin, organized a national campaign to raise funds for a new and bigger church. He wrote, ""Why a church? To unite in a religious setting the workers of all classes. Why Paris? Because Paris is correctly considered the center of labor and industry. Why the Plaisance quarter? Because it is a unique neighborhood inhabited uniquely of workers, which at present does not have a church for its thirty-five thousand inhabitants.""

The initial funds were raised, and construction began. The architect was  (1862–1955), who had also built  in the 13th arrondissement. The work was delayed by high costs, and Soulange-Bodin had to raise more funds to complete it. He was obliged to donate the rest of his personal fortune to finish the work. With the help of donations from local businesses and industrial enterprises, the church was finally completed in April 1902. Restoration and modifications took place in the 1960s and 1970s""Guide de visite, Notre-Dame-du Travail"", p. 7

 Exterior 

The exterior of the church, facing Square du Cardinal-Wyszynski, is in the neo-Romanesque style, giving little hint of the modern features of the interior.

A notable work of art on the exterior is found in the tympanum over the portal. ""The Virgin and Child"" was painted in the neo-Byzantine style by Genevieve and Henri Taillefert at the beginning of the 20th century.

The Bell of Sevastopol and the Carillon
The facade is flanked by octagonal towers on either side. One tower also serves as a bell tower. It holds a large bell, brought to Paris from Sevastopol as a trophy at the end of the Crimean War, in 1854. The victorious French general Patrice de Mac Mahon took five bells from the cathedral and brought them to France as war trophies. Four of the bells were given to the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris (where they are on display in a corridor) and the fifth was given to Notre-Dame du Travail, before its reconstruction. In 1865 the Emperor Napoleon III and the Empress Eugenie personally presented the bell to the church .
The bell weighs 551 kilograms, and is 100 centimetres in diameter and 94 centimetres high. When the church moved to its present location, it was found that the bell was too heavy for the tower, and it was placed in the garden, where it remained until 1976. when it was transferred to new concrete structure built on top of the old stairway tower.""Guide de visite, Notre-Dame-du Travail"", page 40. 

In addition the Bell of Sevastopol, the church has a carillon with four bells placed on the roof. It plays a brief melody of six notes (re-sharp,do-sharp, si, do-sharp,re-sharp,sol-sharp) every quarter hour.

 Interior 

The church is fifty-nine metres long and twenty-five metres high. The central part of the nave 9.5 metres wide and twenty metres high, up to the steel ribs of the vault. The most prominent features of the interior are the two rows of steel columns which divide the church into a central aisle and two collateral aisles. The collateral aisles are lined with small chapels, with the nave flanked by arcades supporting the arches of the ceiling and the collateral aisles, replacing the traditional stone columns of earlier churches. Astruc deliberately made the interior look industrial, so that ""it would call to the mind of the worker his factory, surrounded by a familiar milieu.""

According to some accounts, the steel framework was recuperated from the Palace of Industry of the 1855 Paris Universal Exposition, which had been demolished to make room for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900. Astruc riveted the pieces together, following his own plan, leaving the plates and rivets fully visible. The new elements of the frame were fabricated in a workshop on Boulevard de Vaugirard, and brought to the site for installation.Dupré 
 The Choir and Chapel of the Virgin 

The choir, where the altar is located, has three arcades with rounded arches, in the neo-Romanesque style. The central portion is covered by a half-dome, with stained glass windows above it.
The Chapel of the Virgin ia located in the apse, directly behind the altar.

The statue of the Virgin Mary with the child Jesus behind the altar was made in 1898 by Joseph Lefévre (1836-1911). It was carved out of a single block of limestone which weighs seven thousand kilograms. In keeping with the theme of ""Our Lady of Labor"", the base of statue is decorated with carvings that illustrate the principal industries in the paris.

The chapel is decorated with two monumental frescos, one on either side of the altar, each two metres high and nine metres long, together called ""Notre-Dame du Travail, assistance to the afflicted"", They offer a tribute to work and to charity. The first illustrates an angel appearing to workers of varied professions, and the second show acts charity, including the liberation of captives, the education of the young, and assistance to the sick. The frescos were the work of Félix Villé, and were made in 1904.""Guide de visite, Notre-Dame-du Travail"" p. 21

The chapels of sides of the choir are also decorated with sculptural work full of symbolism. ""Christ in Glory"" on the left side, depicts a gilded abstract figure of Christ floating in the air over a tabernacle of scrolls surrounded by an abstract sculpural fire, representing the burning bush of the Old Testament. This sculpture was made by Jean-Jacques Bris in the early 20th century. The modernist altar was also designed by Jean-Jacques Bris, and dates from the 20th century. On he right is a statue of Christ on the cross is from the same period, and is the work of Charles Correia.

 The Side Chapels 

Long galleries run the length of the walls of the nave, below the high stained glass windows, which are mostly white glass, to admit more light. The arcades along the collateral aisles hold a series small chapels, each decorated with paintings and sculpture. While the structure of the interior is modern, the decoration around the paintings reflects the Art Nouveau style floral designs of the period, with lavish use of floral designs on the walls and around the art.

 The Baptistry 

The Baptistry was created for the traditional full immersion of the person baptized. It designed by the Taileferts, husband and wife artists, with modern decoration added in 1985 by Casare Bizi (1934-2005)
The walls and furnishings of the Baptistry are full of symbols, taken from the very early periods of Christianity, when artists avoided direct depictions of God or Christ. These include the use of the ""Chrisme"", a combination of Greek letters representing the name of Christ; a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, and a hand reaching down symbolzing the hand of God. The steps leading down to the water are black, to represent how the word of God washes away the forces of evil; the sides are red, to represent the force of love. An ambon is placed behind the water, decorated with symbols of ""The Word"" and ""The Christ, the Verb of God"".""Guide de visite, Notre-Dame-du Travail"", p. 11

 Sculpture 

The chapels display a variety of works of sculpture, in styles ranging from neo-classical to modern. 

The tabernacle next to the Chapel of the Virgin contains two modern sculptures by Jean-jacques Bris. At the bottom is ""The Fire of God"", depicting the presentation to Moses of the first chapters of the scripture, surrounded by a sacred fire representing the biblical Burning Bush, where the chapters were first presented to Moses. Above the fire is a statue of Christ in Glory, on the cross of the crucifixion floating in the air,""Guide de visite, Notre-Dame-du Travail"", p. 19
A notable modern work in the church is a group of fourteen small carved wooden plaques (53 by 24 centimetres), in the neo-Romaneque style, placed on the steel columns in the nave. They illustrate the events of the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Christ. Crowded with stylized figures, they were made by Christine Audin (born 1960).""Guide de visite, Notre-Dame-du Travail"", p. 38

 The Organ 

The grand organ is modern, built in 1991 by the firm of Haepfer and installed in the tribune at entrance to the Nave. It has sixty-one notes on the regular keyboard, sixty-one expressive notes, and thirty-two pedals. It has an unusual feature; it has two separate consoles or keyboards;, one located in the tribune with the organ, with a traditional mechanical connection to the instrument, and a second mobile keyboard which is located in the nave. The mobile keyboard has three keyboards and thirty-two foot pedals, which are connected by a multiplex system to the organ. It can play all the same notes as the traditional keyboard, as well as additional expressive notes that are specific to it.",2025-03-13,['Roman Catholic churches in the 14th arrondissement of Paris'],"['14th arrondissement of Paris' 'Gare Montparnasse' 'Franco-Prussian War'

15,56560,76603394,30454,Lunar Panoramic Photography - Apollo 16,"NASA's Apollo Lunar Surface Journal (ALSJ) records the details of each mission's period on the lunar surface as a timeline of the activities undertaken, the dialogue between the crew and Mission Control, and the relevant documentary records. Each photograph taken on the mission is catalogued there and each panoramic photograph sequence is also recorded. This page tabulates the Apollo 16 panoramas and, where appropriate, provides updated representations of the panoramas blended using more recent technologies than the originals.

 Context 

Apollo 16 was the second of Apollo's ""J Missions"" using an enhanced Lunar Module that was capable of supporting a 3-day stay on the lunar surface *and* the delivery of the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV or ""Rover"") to the surface to allow the crew to extend the range of their exploration and to provide remote TV coverage. 

In terms of photography, Apollo 16's crew surpassed their predecessors on Apollo 15 in no short measure. 1800 frames were captured whilst on the lunar surface resulting in around 100 panoramic sequences. An interesting point that arises in the subsequent tables is the ratio of panoramas taken by the Commander (John Young) and the Lunar Module Pilot (Charlie Duke) - Duke takes around four times as many as his colleague and this 4:1 ratio is the highest across all the missions.

The Lunar Module (LM), Orion, landed with its door and ladder leg (AKA ""+Z strut"") pointing approximately due west. The Sun's elevation was around 22°-25° for EVA 1, 34°-38° for EVA 2, and 46°-49° for EVA 3.

The higher elevations of the Sun across the EVAs can be seen through the improvement in the quality of the panoramas; the Sun itself, and any resulting lens flair, is barely noticeable whereas it featured prominently in the earlier missions.

 Rover Panoramas (LVR Pans) 

Charlie Duke is credited with inventing a new procedure during EVA 2; the ""LRV Pan"" or ""Rover Pan"" (also known as a ""360""). The process of getting on and off of the rover was protracted due to the bulky suit and backpack that the astronauts wore, but Duke realised that by having Young drive the rover in a tight circle he could snap a panoramic sequence simply by pointing the camera straight ahead and continuously pressing the shutter button from his seated position (""click - click - click - click - click -click"")

Although efficient in terms of time and effort, the approach presented some issues:-
 Panoramic sequences are best shot from a single position - in these cases the camera was moved (or was being moved) for each shot
 Every shot contains foreground items (the rover's TV camera and antenna) that impact on as much as 50% of each image
 The camera is subject to the movements and orientation of the rover
 Camera settings have to be changed ""On the fly""

The first noted LRV Pan was the sequence AS16-115-18503 to 18511 - see ""Timestamp 148:41:11"" below. Empirical analysis suggests that the sequence is limited to AS16-115-18107 to 18711 and the result is shown below:-

 Non-EVA (LM-based) panoramas 

By this, the fifth landing, the need for contingency photos taken from the Lunar Module was greatly reduced, so low in fact, that only one panorama was taken through each of the windows (and subsequently combined). No panoramas were taken from the LM between the EVAs or after the final return.

17,16128,5297201,13826,Aarudra,"Arudra (born Bhagavatula Sadasiva Sankara Sastry; 31 August 1925 – 4 June 1998) was an Indian author, poet, lyricist, translator, publisher, dramatist, playwright, and an expert on Telugu literature. He is also known for his works in Telugu cinema as a lyricist, dialogue writer, and story writer. He received the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1987.

Early life
Aarudra was born in Yelamanchili, Anakapalli district, Andhra Pradesh, India on 31 August 1925. Aarudra is the nephew of Telugu poet Sri Sri. After primary education, he shifted to Vizianagaram in 1942 for his college education. He was attracted to communism after coming into contact with people like Ronanki Appalaswami and Chaganti Somayajulu.

He joined the Indian Air Force as a Band Boy in 1943 and served it till 1947. He shifted to Madras and worked as editor of Anandavani magazine for two years.

Literary works
Tvamevaham (You are none other than me) and Samagra Andhra Sahityam (An Encyclopedia of Telugu Literature) are his landmark works.

Reprinted in 1989Aarudra, 'Samagra Aaandhra Saahityam' (2005): Revised and Reprinted, Published by Telugu Akademi, Hyderabad. He translated the Tamil treatise Tirukkural into Telugu. He belonged to the school of progressive writers such as Abhyudaya Rachayitala Sangham.

Tvamevaham
Tvamevaaham written in 1948 was based on the contemporary violence and lawlessness during the Razakar movement in the princely state of Hyderabad. The Razakar attrocoties were sponsored by the Nizam against his own people who wanted to overthrow him in favor of democracy and join the Indian Union. In this kaavyam, death spoke to a human being and says, ""you and I are the same (Tvamevaaham)"".Aarudra, 'Vennela-vesavi', Navodaya Publishers, Vijayawada, 1977

How is Sita related to Rama?
Ramudiki Sita Yemautundi? or How is Sita related to Rama?, put before the public the riddle of Mandodari, Sita and Hanuman and their origins in a lucid and scholarly way. It was a bold attempt at cracking the Valmiki-Ramayana code and in the process de-mystified the story of Rama to the middle-class, literate, modern day Telugu reader.
Aarudra, 'Ramudiki Seetemautundi? 'Vishalandra Publishing House, Hyderabad, 1978.

The book explores the Buddhist and Jain sources of the story of Rama. It also surveys the Khotan Siam (Thai), Laos, and Malaysian versions of the story of Rama. Here is a sampling from the  'Dasaratha Jataka ', a Buddhist Tale:
Buddha narrates the 'Dasaratha Jataka' tale to a householder who was grieving the death of his son....Long long ago.. Dasaratha was the king of Varanasi. He had sixteen thousand wives.The Queen had two sons and a daughter.The eldest son was called Ramapundit and the younger one was called Laxmanpundit. The daughter was called Sitadevi. The Queen dies after sometime. Dasaratha marries again, and comes to like her the most. She begets a son named Bharata...When Ramapundit returns from the forest, he marries Sita and rules for 16000 years...Bodhisatta concludes the story stating that Dasaratha was none other than Shuddhodana (Father of Buddha) in an earlier reincarnation. Similarly, Sita was none other than Rahulmata (Mother of Rahul or Wife of Buddha) and Ramapundit was none other than Buddha himself.Aarudra's questions like ""How is Sita related to Rama?"" or ""Were they just Husband and wife?"" may sound naive or sacrilegious but a serious study of genealogies, as revealed from different sources, logically leads to them. To deny the existence of such stories, per Arudra, would have amounted to intellectual dishonesty.

25,30338,75836222,5912,The Mouser,"The Mouser is an album by cellist Tomeka Reid and percussionist Filippo Monico. It was recorded during 2015 at Monico's studio in Milano, Italy, and was released in 2019 by Relative Pitch Records.

According to Reid, she and Monico had never played together prior to the recording session. She stated that she had forgotten about the meeting until Monico presented her with a thumb drive of the session in 2017, and was pleasantly surprised by the results.

Reception

In a review for All About Jazz, John Sharpe wrote: ""this is one of those albums where the focus is more on the dialogue between two people than any preconceived notions of the roles of the instruments themselves... What is remarkable for such a first time meeting is that there is none of the tentativeness which sometimes afflicts such encounters. And furthermore they avoid the obvious, to the extent that you never quite know what is coming next in their restless exchanges.""

Ivana Ng of The New York City Jazz Record called the album ""an intimate session"" and ""unstructured play at its best."" She stated: ""Imaginative and daring, the two dive into the margins and depths of the cello and drums to uncover a much richer instrumentation and aural palette than one would expect from a duo... [the musicians]  have a natural rapport immediately apparent from the very first note. Their interplay is cerebral yet joyful.""

The Downtown Music Gallery'''s Bruce Lee Gallanter commented: ""The music here has a most organic, natural sounding quality, especially since both instruments are completely acoustic... This is an extraordinary duo with both players pushing their sounds past normal constraints. Somewhat low-key but no less incredible!""

A reviewer for Poison Pie Publishing House remarked: ""We can't immediately identify another cello and drums duet, but presumably in the history of human music-making, such a combination has previously manifested. Even so, it is unlikely that the sort of music that emerged bore any resemblance to that which Ms. Reid and Mr. Monico coax from their respective instruments.""

Writing for The Free Jazz Collective'', Olle Lawson described the album as ""a wonderful, fully-improvised document of shifting tonal colour, empathic interplay and dark, layered feeling - finally capturing on record the freer depth of Ms Reid's evolving art... Highly Recommended.""

Wood was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts in 1877. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from Brown University in 1900. He married Elizabeth Marvin in 1913, and they had two daughters. He lived in Boston, where he had a photo engraving business. His work for the American Numismatic Society would take him to New York City in 1913.Smith

Wood had a long association with the American numismatic community. He was secretary to the Boston Numismatic Society from 1908 to 1913. He also served as general secretary to the ANA from 1905 to 1909, and then governor and chairman from 1909 to 1912. Wood became an associate editor of The Numismatist from 1909 to 1910, and was an associate editor and later editor of the American Journal of Numismatics from 1910 to 1920. He was also the curator of the American Numismatic Society Museum from 1913 to 1938. He received the Archer M. Huntington Award, which recognizes outstanding career contributions to numismatic scholarship, in 1920.Smith

Wood was the author of several numismatic publications, including:
 The Canadian Blacksmith Coppers (1910)
 The coinage of the West Indies, and the sou marqué (1915)
 Catalogue of United States and Colonial Coins (1914)
 The Mexican revolutionary coinage, 1913-1916 (1921)
 The Gold Dollars of 1858 with Notes of the Other Issues (1922)
 The Commemorative Coinage of the United States (1922)
 The Tegucigalpa Coinage of 1823 (1923)
The coinage of Ethiopia (1937)

Wood died of pneumonia in Flushing, Queens early in 1938. 

Legacy
Beginning in 1952 an award in his name was first presented, the most prestigious award provided to numismatic exhibitors by the ANA. In 1969 he was commemorated in the ANA Numismatic Hall of Fame.Smith

Within Canadian numismatics, Wood is best remembered for his work on the Blacksmith tokens, which he first systematically described in a publication in 1910. While other Canadian numismatists had commented on them before, Wood was the first to categorize them.

The existence of coal deposits around Heerlen had been known for centuries (coal had been dug up since the 13th century around Rolduc), but efficient transportation was lacking. In 1886 Henri Sarolea had the idea of building a railroad between Herzogenrath, Heerlen, and Sittard, which was finished in 1896. It was this plan that prompted the building of the first mine (Oranje Nassau I, operational from 1899 to 1974).ON-algemeen 

While Oranje Nassau Mijnen was the public name of the company, the legal name was N.V. Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Limburgsche Steenkolenmijnen. It was the largest private mining company in the Netherlands and is now owned by the French Wendel Investissement group, which acquired the founders' shares in 1908.

29,30620,75848849,7923,The Clam Shack,"The Clam Shack is a seafood restaurant in Kennebunkport, Maine that serves its food for take-out. It has been in operation since 1968 and serves dishes from New England's cuisine. It is especially known for its lobster rolls. The shack has won accolades from magazines like Gourmet and Travel + Leisure. It is only open from May to October. Many celebrities have been spotted at the restaurant.

History
The fish market The Clam Shack is located in was originally known as Shackford and Gooch and began its operations in the 1930s. The small shack near the river that became The Clam Shack was rented as the restaurant in 1968.

The restaurant is owned by Steve Kingston, who bought it in 2000.  Some recipes from the shack were featured in The Bush Family Cookbook, which was published in 2005. It supplied lobster and swordfish to a dinner on Vladimir Putin's diplomatic visit to Walker's Point Estate in Kennebunkport.

Menu
The restaurant sells fried clams, haddock, scallops, shrimp, calamari, chicken fingers, onion rings, bisque, french fries, and clam cake. It also has clam chowder, prawn cocktail, steamed clams, dill pickle, and cole slaw. There is a lobster dinner coming in small, medium, and large sizes. The Clam Shack also sells sandwiches such as burgers, hot dogs, tuna rolls, and grilled cheese.

Lobster roll
The restaurant's well-known lobster roll is made from  of lobster meat from lobsters trapped off the coast of Kennebunkport. The handpicked claw, knuckle, and tail meat boiled in fresh ocean water to be sandwiched between two family-made rolls from Reilly's Bakery in Biddeford. Lobster rolls are usually served on hot dog buns, setting The Clam Shack apart from many other restaurants. Fifty lobsters are boiled at a time and the lobsters are handpicked because knives can cause oxidation, which may taint the flavor. Customers can add butter, mayonnaise, or both to their bun. The butter is made at Kate's, a creamery in Arundel. It sells kits to make the dish on the online marketplace Goldbelly. At the height of the restaurant's popularity during the summer, The Clam Shack sells over 500 rolls daily. A roll costs US$16 as of 2015.

In addition to winning the Lobster Roll Rumble four times, the dish was selected by The Boston Globe in 2013 as the best in New England.",2024-07-27,"['1968 establishments in Maine' 'Kennebunkport, Maine'

30,39596,76126101,12312,Sensory neuronopathy,"Sensory neuronopathy (also known as sensory ganglionopathy) is a type of peripheral neuropathy that results primarily in sensory symptoms (such as parasthesias, pain or ataxia) due to destruction of nerve cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglion. The causes of nerve damage are grouped into categories including those due to paraneoplastic causes (neuropathy secondary to cancer), immune mediated, infectious, inherited or degenerative causes and those due to toxin exposure. In idiopathic sensory neuronopathy no cause is identified. Idiopathic causes account for about 50% of cases. Sensory neuronopathy differs from the more common length dependent axonal polyneuropathies (such as diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy) in that the symptoms do not progress in a distal to proximal pattern (starting in the feet and progressing to the legs and hands), rather symptoms develop in a multifocal, asymmetric, and non-length dependent manner (often involving all 4 limbs at onset). Ataxia (lack of coordination) is a prominent symptom early in the disease course. The trigeminal nerve ganglion is also commonly affected leading to facial numbness. Motor nerves are usually not affected however some cases do have mild motor involvement in the form of weakness. Symptoms tend to develop sub-acutely, over weeks, in acquired sensory neuronopathy and more slowly in inherited or primary degenerative cases. In cases of paraneoplastic or infectious sensory neuropathy, treatment is directed at the underlying cancer or infectious cause respectively. Immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory therapies are also commonly used however their effectiveness is limited. 
 Signs and symptoms 
The dorsal root ganglion contains cell bodies for sensory nerves including large, myelinated Aβ fibers which carry proprioception and tactile touch sensation to the brain via the dorsal column–medial lemniscus pathway and small, unmyelinated C fibers which carry thermal and pain sensation to the brain via the spinothalamic tract.  The destruction of nerve bodies in the dorsal root ganglia in sensory ganglionopathies thus leads to symptoms of ataxia, decreased sensation, pain, dysesthesia, paresthesias and allodynia that characteristically occurs in a multifocal, asymmetric distribution and in a non-length dependent manner. Symptoms usually start in the upper and lower extremities at onset and often also involve the face. This is in contrast to diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy and other length-dependent axonal polyneuropathies in which symptoms start in the feet and then progress proximally to affect the legs, hands, arms, thighs and trunk. Strength is usually normal, but sometimes can be mildly affected. The symptom onset in acquired sensory neuronopathy is subacute with symptoms developing over weeks, however idiopathic and inherited causes often follow a more chronic, indolent course with symptoms developing over years.   
 Cause 
Sensory neuronopathy is thought to be primarily a T-cell mediated inflammatory process that leads to destruction of nerve cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglion. The dorsal root ganglion is not separated by a blood brain barrier as it contains fenestrated capillaries which are highly permeable. This allows antibodies, T-cells, toxins and other substances to enter, causing damage to the nerve cell bodies. Paraneoplastic sensory neuropathy occurs in the setting of cancer and is thought to involve anti-cancer antibodies cross reacting with antigens that are expressed by neurons and cancer cells. The most common auto-antibodies are those of the T-cell mediated anti-Hu antibodies being taken up by nerve cells and attaching to ELAV-like protein 1 (ELAVL-1), ELAVL-2 and ELAVL-3 which are mRNA binding proteins. Small cell lung cancer is the most common anti-Hu antibody associated paraneoplastic syndrome associated sensory neuropathy. But other cancers which may cause paraneoplastic sensory neuropathy include bronchogenic carcinoma, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, neuroendocrine tumors, mixed Mullerian tumor and sarcomas. Symptoms of sensory neuropathy may sometimes precede the cancer diagnosis by several months.

Immune mediated sensory neuronopathy is commonly associated with Sjogrens syndrome. Sjogren's is most commonly affected by a length dependent axonal sensorimotor neuropathy characterized by symptoms in the extremities. However, people with Sjogren's may also develop a sensory neuronopathy with progressive numbness in the face, trunk, limbs in a non-length dependent manner. In Sjogren's sensory neuronopathy, vibratory and proprioceptive sensations are profoundly affected, leading to a severe ataxia. Sensory neuronopathy is thought to involve 40% of neuropathies in Sjogren's syndrome and 5% of all cases of Sjogren's overall, it is usually subacute in onset. Other immune mediated causes of sensory neuronopathy include systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune hepatitis and celiac disease.

Toxin exposure can also lead to sensory neuronopathies. Platinum-based antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agents are particularly toxic to the dorsal root ganglion. And long term vitamin B6 toxicity has also been implicated, with severe ataxia due to large fiber proprioceptive involvement. Vitamin B6 is thought to lead to neuropathy due to its cytoskeletal and microtubule toxicity leading to nerve cell loss with prolonged overdosing.

Possible infectious causes of sensory neuronopathy include HIV (in which lymphocyte infiltrates have been observed in the dorsal root ganglion), Human T-lymphotropic virus 1, Epstein-Barr virus and varicella zoster virus.

Several inherited neurodegenerative disease have also been shown to have dorsal root ganglion destruction leading to sensory ganglionopathy (in addition to other central and peripheral nervous system aberrations). These include Friedrich ataxia, Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), and Facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy (FOSMN).

 Diagnosis 
Sensory neuronopathy is diagnosed clinically, based on signs and symptoms, along with nerve conduction studies. Ataxia in the upper and lower extremities at onset or at full development, asymmetric distribution of sensory loss, sensory loss not being restricted to the lower limbs (as in length dependent axonal polyneuropathy) are specific to sensory neuronopathies. Nerve conduction studies will show absent or reduced sensory nerve conduction action potentials in the upper and lower limbs with preserved conduction velocity. Motor nerve action potentials and conduction are usually unaffected (as motor function is usually preserved in sensory neuronopathies), but in a subset of cases may have limited dysfunction. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid may show increased protein, pleocytosis and oligoclonal bands but this is non-specific. Biopsy of the dorsal nerve root ganglions show a characteristic CD8+ T-cell inflammation pattern, but this is not required for diagnosis and is technically difficult to complete, only sometimes being done on autopsy. A skin biopsy may show decreased density of nerve fibers, but this is rarely needed for the diagnosis. MRI may show T2 enhancement and swelling of the dorsal root ganglia, as well as degeneration of the posterior columns of the spinal cord.

 Treatment 
Treatment in sensory neuronopathy is usually ineffective. Immunomodulation has been used in with varying levels of success. This includes steroids, immunoglobulin therapy, plasma exchange, cyclophosphamide, rituximab and sirolimus. Immunomodulatory treatments are more efficacious if started early in the disease process (within 2 months of symptom onset). Treating the underlying cancer in paraneoplastic disease usually does not alleviate the symptoms.

Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as duloxetine or venlafaxine and gabapentinoids such as gabapentin or pregabalin may be used for the symptomatic treatment of pain including dysesthesias or hyperalgesia.

 Prognosis 
Anti-Hu paraneoplastic associated sensory neuronopathy carries a poor prognosis, with median survival of less than 1 year and a 20% 36 month survival.

Idiopathic sensory neuronopathy usually does not respond to immunotherapy and the prognosis regarding symptoms control is poor.",2025-04-09,['Neurological disorders' 'Peripheral nervous system disorders'],"['peripheral neuropathy' 'parasthesias' 'ataxia' 'dorsal root ganglion'

31,11222,75299451,72841,2005 NIRSA National Soccer Championship,"The 2005 NIRSA national soccer championship, also referred to as the NIRSA Collegiate Soccer Sport Club championship, was the 12th NIRSA National Soccer Championships, the annual national championships for United States-based, collegiate club soccer teams organized by NIRSA. It took place at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, Alabama from Thursday, November 17 to Saturday, November 19, 2005.

 Overview 
This tournament marked the first year back following the initial cancellation of the previous tournament with only the men's championship declaring a winner in a rescheduled event.

 Men's championship 
In finals, two teams would make their finals debuts in Colorado and Vanderbilt. Prior to this, both teams were coming off quarterfinals defeats the previous tournament. In the group stage, Colorado beat Dayton 4–1 in their opener then defeat UTEP 3–1 to top their group. Meanwhile, Vanderbilt would beat 1994 champions, Purdue, 1–0 then beat 2000 champions, Penn State, 1–0 to also top their group.

In the knockout round, Colorado would beat Missouri 4–1 in the sweet 16 then would beat Penn State 2–0 in the quarterfinals while Vanderbilt would beat Northern Iowa 5–0 in the sweet 16, then concede their first goal of the tournament in a 3–1 win over Dayton. In the first semifinals for both teams, Colorado would defeat reigning champions, Texas A&M, 3–1 while Vanderbilt would beat 2002 champions and regional champions, Weber State, 3–1 to advance to their first finals.

In the finals, Vanderbilt would concede a penalty in the first half that Eric Bjork of Colorado would score to give Colorado a 1–0 lead. Colorado would hold this lead until eventual all-tournament member Nick Van Buecken would inadvertently handle the ball in his own box in the final minute of regulation to give Vanderbilt a penalty that they would convert tying the game at 1–1 and force the game to go into two ten-minute sudden victory overtime periods. In overtime, Nick Van Buecken would make-up for his previous mistake when he assisted eventual tournament MVP Chris Brosz with a cross into the box in overtime. The game would instantly end with this goal, giving Colorado their first national championship in overtime.

 Women's championship 
In the finals, two of the previous year's co-champions, Colorado State and Michigan, were both looking to claim their 4th national title and join Colorado as the team with the most titles at 4. In the group stage, both teams would struggle and finish second in their group. Colorado State would lose their opener to a fellow reigning co-champion UC-Santa Barbara 1–2 then would win their second match against Texas A&M 2–1 and finally, a 1–1 tie against Illinois would be enough to advance to the quarterfinals. Meanwhile, Michigan would win their opener 2–1 against Delaware, then would lose to eventual group winners Texas 1–0, and finally would win their finale against UCLA 1–0.

In the knockout round, Colorado State would win their quarterfinal match against Florida 2–1 then would win their semifinal matchup against Texas 4–0. Meanwhile, Michigan would beat Arizona 2–1 in the quarterfinals then would face fellow reigning co-champion Colorado. Following a 1–1 draw and a scoreless overtime, penalties would be required to determine the winner. In the shootout, senior captain for Michigan, Bre Bennett saved all three of Colorado's attempts, meaning the three makes for Michigan would be enough to advance to the finals. In the finals, Colorado would score first but junior captain Dana Restrick tied the game at 1-1 with six minutes to play. The game would remain tied 1–1 at the end of regulation meaning two ten-minute sudden victory overtime periods would be required to determine a winner. In overtime, freshman striker, Katie Miller of Michigan, would score immediately ending the game at 2–1 and giving Michigan their fourth national title. Following this, Katie Miller would be named the tournament's MVP and eventually would make Michigan's varsity roster following a February 2006 tryout, becoming the team's first player that originated from the club team.

 Men's open 
In the finals, 2000 men's open finalist, Oregon, were looking to claim their first national title against men's open finals debutants UC-Berkeley. Both teams would win all three group stage games with Oregon beating SE Louisiana 2–0, UW-Eau Claire 4–0, then finally Georgia Tech 2–0 while UC-Berkeley would beat UW-Stout 2–0, Georgia Southern 3–1, then North Dakota State 2–0. In the quarterfinals, Oregon would beat Georgia Southern 2–0 and UC-Berkeley would beat Georgia Tech 4–3 in overtime. In the semifinals, Oregon would beat Arizona 5–1 while UC-Berkeley would beat Alabama 3–2. In the finals, Oregon would win 2–0 and claim their first national title. Oregon's Brian Mikalaitis would be named tournament MVP.

 Women's open 
In the finals, 2000 women's open championship, Virginia, would face in-state rival and 1997 women's open champion, Virginia Tech. In the group stage, despite winning their second match against Miami 1–0 and their finale against Colorado State's ""Green"" team 3–1, Virginia would finish second in their group due to a 3–3 draw in their opener and a lost coin flip to group winners Cornell. Meanwhile, Virginia Tech would be in one of the three groups that only had 3 teams and would finish with 9 points following a 2–0 win over Virginia Tech and a 1–0 win over Colorado's ""Black"" team. In the quarterfinals, Virginia would beat 2003's open division finalist Kansas 2–1 while Virginia Tech would beat Iowa State 1–0. In the semifinals, Virginia would beat Colorado's ""Black"" team 2–0 while Virginia Tech would beat Cornell 2–1. In the finals, Virginia would score the lone goal in a 1–0 win over Virginia Tech to claim their second open title, the first women's team to do so. Virginia's Lauren Nuffer would be named tournament MVP.

 Format 
The competition consisted of 72 teams: 40 championship teams and 32 open teams. The divisions were further divided into a men's and women's division: 24 men's and 16 women's teams in the championship division as well as 16 men's and 16 women's teams in the open division. The divisions were then further divided into groups: eight groups of three teams in the men's championship then four teams of four teams in the remaining 3 divisions.

All four divisions engaged in a round-robin tournament that determined teams able to advance to a knockout stage. Each team played every other team in their group once in pool play which consisted of two 40-minute halves separated by a seven-minute halftime and utilized the three points for a win system. After pool play, the two highest ranked teams from each group advanced to their respective knockout stage, with the third placed team in the men's championship advancing to a consolation bracket while the third and fourth placed teams in the other divisions were eliminated.

Knockout stage games also consisted of two 40-minute halves with the round of 16 and quarterfinals separated by a seven-minute halftime and the semifinals and finals had a ten-minute halftime. Knockout stage games needed to declare a winner, therefore if a game was tied at the end of regulation in the round of sixteen or quarterfinals, no more than two five-minute sudden victory overtime periods would be played, while in the semifinals and finals, no more than two ten-minute sudden victory overtime periods would be played. Teams would change ends after the conclusion of the first overtime period. If still tied after overtime, kicks from the mark would determine the winner.

 Qualification and selections 
Each of the six regions received three automatic bids for the Men’s Championship Division and two automatic bids for the Women’s Championship Division. The final 6 bids for the Men’s Championship Division and final 4 bids for the Women’s Championship were given out by NIRSA to teams, typically based on their regional tournament results and RPI.

The remaining teams participated in the open division, chosen on a first-come first-serve basis via online registration beginning on September 6, 2005 with a max of 16 teams per gender division.

38,54094,76527002,3125,"Teatro Masini, Faenza","The Teatro Angelo Masini is an opera house located on Piazza Nenni in central Faenza, region of Emilia-Romagna, Italy.

The structure was built during 1780–1787 to replace the antecedent and smaller Teatro dell'Accademia dei Remoti which had been located in the Palazzo del Podestà. The Academy of the Remote had been originally been founded in 1673 as a literary and erudite society. Meeting in the Palazzo del Podesta, in 1714 they decided to erect a small crowded theater in their meeting hall with three orders, designed by Carlo Cesare Scaletta and inaugurated on 21 June 1723. But the seating began to fall into ruin, and alternate plans were commissioned. The architect Giuseppe Pistocchi had suggested to build a new theater in the Podesta, but the location was moved to this courtyard-piazza for this theater. Much of the funding was provided by the municipality. The inaugural performances included two ballets and the opera Caio Ostilio by Francesco Bianchi. 
 
In 1826, it underwent its first refurbishment under Filippo Antolini and Antonio Argnani. The refurbishment cleaned some of the soot created by the lamps, and modified the central balcony seats which had double height. Pasquale Saviotti in 1827 painted a new theater curtain (sipario). In 1850-1853 and 1869, other refurbishments were pursued. More recent refurbishment in the 1990s updated numerous safety features.

In 1903, the name of the theater was changed in honor of the famous opera tenor Angelo Masini (1844-1926). The interior of the theater has a series of bas-reliefs in terracotta depicting events from classic mythology and Ancient Roman history. At the highest register are a series of statues also by Gaetano Trentanove depicting individuals from the classic myths.

A long gallery, still called the Galleria or the Ridotto dei Cento Pacific, was built along the facade. The Cento or hundred refers to an oligarchy of magnates and magistrates which pacified the town during the conflicts between the Guelphs and Ghibellines. This oligarchic congregation was abolished in 1797 by the Napoleonic government, who feared its opposition. The gallery links the theater and a wing of Palazzo Manfredi which runs along Corso Mazzini. The gallery was frescoed by Felice Giani and Serafino Barassi.Pro Loco Faenza.",2024-12-16,"['Opera houses in Italy' 'Buildings and structures in Faenza'

39,49290,76402671,26182,Stößensee Bridge,"The Stößenseebrücke is a steel truss bridge over the Stößensee and the Havelchaussee in the Berlin district of Spandau.Although the district boundary sign of the Spandau district of Wilhelmstadt is located in the middle of the bridge - above the western bank of the Stößensee - the entire bridge belongs to Wilhelmstadt according to the entry 09085599 in the Berlin State Monument List and according to the demarcation in all more precise maps. The listed bridge from 1908/1909 is part of Heerstraße (federal highway 2/5) and connects the Spandau district of Wilhelmstadt with the Westend district of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf. The biggest technical and financial problem during the construction of the Heerstraße was bridging the Havel lowland, which includes the Stößensee, an old arm of the Havel. From several options, including an additional 250-meter-long bridge over the Scharfe Lanke, the planners opted for a route that could manage with two bridges - over the Havel and the Stößensee. With regard to the variants of the Stößensee bridge, the ""small"" solution with a dam embankment and a bridge around 100 meters long was chosen instead of a bridge over the entire lake. The bridge consists of a system of cantilever girders with connected towing girders and has a span of around 50 meters. It was designed by civil engineer Karl Bernhard.

 Bridging the Havel lowlands 
Together with the Frey Bridge 800 meters to the west, which crosses the Havel, which was canalized in this area in 1880/1881, the Stößensee Bridge spans the waters of the Havel lowlands. The Stößensee is a bulge of old Havel arms, the remains of which are preserved in the area of the Tiefwerder Wiesen with the Faulen See, the Hohlen Weg and the main ditch. The eastern shore of Stößensee rises towards Grunewald, the western shore towards Pichelswerder - both part of the north-western foothills of the Teltow Plateau, which borders the Havel to the west. The original soft-ice glacial RinnseeKiezspaziergang on October 9, 2004 along the Havelhöhenweg with district mayor Monika Thiemen and forester Ruthenberg. Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf district office. lake, or the later Havel branch, had dug into the edge of the plateau, so that the bridge height of around 25 meters, which is unusual for Berlin conditions, had to be built. For landscape planning reasons and to save costs and avoid having to bridge the entire 350-meter-long Stößensee, the Stößensee was filled in with a dam from the Pichelswerder and divided in two except for a channel that was kept open. Beyond the division of the lake, the embankment and the bridge connected the former island of Pichelswerder to the western land and turned the Werder into today's peninsula.

The bridge was part of the overall Döberitzer Heerstraße project, which was built between 1903 and 1911 as an extension of Kaiserdamm as a direct link from Berlin Palace via the towns of Charlottenburg and Spandau, which were independent until their incorporation into Greater Berlin in 1920, to the Döberitz military training area. The east–west road comprises today's streets Unter den Linden, Straße des 17. Juni, Bismarckstraße, Kaiserdamm, Heerstraße and, after the Berlin city limits, Hamburger Chaussee in Dallgow-Döberitz. The road, built for military reasons, was public from the outset and opened up the western Grunewald forest and Pichelswerder for Berlin excursion traffic.

At the time of construction, the site of the bridge belonged to the Grunewald-Forst estate district (partly merged into the Heerstraße estate district in 1914) in the district of Teltow. While the military, finance and forestry treasury as well as Berlin, Charlottenburg, Spandau, the district of Teltow, the district of Osthavelland and some municipalities were financially involved in the overall project,Ernst Friedel: Döberitzer Heerstraße. ..., S. 292. the Stößensee Bridge was largely financed by the forestry treasury, which the Berlin Monument Database lists as the bridge's builder.Entry 09085599 in the Berlin State Monument List.Adolf Frey: Döberitzer Heerstraße. ..., S. 71.

 Variants and costs 

The otherwise dead straight east–west axis of the entire street makes a single bend and turns slightly to the northwest at Scholzplatz. The route supposedly drawn by Kaiser Wilhelm II using a ruler could not be adhered to for cost reasons, which were due to the difficulties of bridging the Havel lowlands.Adolf Frey: Döberitzer Heerstraße. ..., S. 76. The dead straight continuation would not only have required bridging the Havel and Stößensee, but also the Scharfe Lanke. A 250-metre-long bridge would have had to be built here. The costs for this variant were estimated at 16.9 million marks, ten million of which were accounted for by the Scharfe Lanke bridge alone. A slimmed-down version with embankments in all the waterways touched and shorter bridges would still have cost 11.2 million marks. The chosen variant with the slightly bent route left the Scharfe Lanke to the south untouched. Although the road, which simply continued straight ahead after the bend, reached the Döberitz military training area at a different point than planned, the deviation seemed justifiable to everyone involved in view of the significantly reduced costs and other advantages. The Stößensee Bridge including the dam and the Frey Bridge cost a comparatively low 2.54 million marks. The Stößensee Bridge accounted for 850,000 marks and the dam for 550,000 marks.Karl Bernhard: Stößensee- und Havelbrücke im Zuge der..., p. 323 f.Adolf Frey: Döberitzer Heerstraße. ..., S. 77.

Both the planners involved in the road construction and the bridge engineers endeavored to make the impact on nature as gentle as possible and to affect the landscape as little as possible. According to Adolf Frey, the decision in favor of the small Stößensee bridge with the dam instead of a large bridge over the entire lake was made for landscape planning reasons, after the senior civil engineer Hoßrat had made sketches showing the effects of the variants on the landscape. According to these sketches, a ""dam, if it was built in the style of the adjacent banks with foreshore and planted accordingly, seemed to have less of an impact on the landscape than a [large] bridge."" Excavated material from the army road and from the widening of a nearby valley was used for the dam, which was around 350 meters long and 125 meters wide.Adolf Frey: Döberitzer Heerstraße. ..., S. 77, 80.

 Problems with dam construction 
The above information comes from articles published in 1911 by the bridge designer Karl Bernhard and the head of Heerstraße construction, the Charlottenburg Privy and Chief Building Councillor Adolf Frey (the neighboring Frey Bridge, which until then had been called the Havel Bridge, was named after Frey in 1913). There appear to have been problems with the construction of the dam that the two parties involved in the project did not mention. The morning edition of the Berliner Tageblatt reported on March 1, 1907:""Fifty meters of dam sunk. The construction of the Döberitzer Heeresstraße seems to have found an unfathomable opponent in the Stößensee. The gravel embankment built in this swampy recess of the Havel had already sunk repeatedly.""

 - Berliner Tageblatt, morning edition, March 1, 1907.Created by: Quote

Four years after the dam was completed, the local politician, historian and local historian Ernst Friedel noted that the planners might have opted for a longer bridge if they had known about the problems and the actual costs of backfilling: ""They were thoroughly mistaken about the subsoil conditions of this ancient, rotten and overgrown lake. If one had known that solid ground could only be found at the enormous depth of 35 meters, and that the burdened embankment on both sides had been constantly rising for months before one could stop and tame the escape of the pressed up mud masses with pile and fascine works, one might have preferred a longer bridge as cheaper.""

In total, the embankment required around one million m³ of soil. The digested sludge masses were mixed with water to form a flowing slurry and pushed through hoses into the northern, silted-up part of the lake.The Havel, our home river. Spandauer Zeitung (ed.).

 Construction and maintenance 

 Bridge system 

Inspired by the road bridges in Paris during his visit to the 1900 World Exhibition, Karl Bernhard went on to design ""pleasing iron bridges without architects"", the lines of which were to be created only ""through the interaction of static and aesthetic aspects"". For the Treskow Bridge in 1903, he developed a trussed arch with a tie beam and suspended central span, which formed the supporting members of the bridge with iron girders under the side arches. While he also used this system for the Stubenrauch Bridge and the neighboring Frey Bridge, Kaiser Wilhelm II chose a different variant for the Stößensee Bridge from several of Bernhard's proposals:Cengiz Dicleli: Karl Bernhard. ""The artistic must completely permeate the technical."" In: Forum - Das Forschungsmagazin der Fachhochschule Konstanz, issue 2003/2004, pp. 21-24 ISSN 1611-3748; htwg-konstanz.de (PDF) a system of cantilever girders with connected towing girders.Karl Bernhard: Stößensee- und Havelbrücke im Zuge der ..., p. 327.""The opening on the land side was spanned by a truss girder, which rests on a masonry pier on the land slope and on a pier founded on a pile grid in the shoreline and extends a cantilever girder over the opening on the sea side. A towing beam is suspended at the end of this cantilever beam, which can follow the lowering of the embankment and can later be screwed back up to the correct position as required via its embankment-side support. When the cantilever girder is fully loaded, low tensile stresses arise on the landside support; almost the total bridge load [...] then rests on the middle support.""  - Adolf Frey: Döberitzer Heerstraße, 1911.Adolf Frey: Döberitzer Heerstraße. ..., S. 78.

 Construction 

The bridge support on the Grunewald and embankment side resulted in a height of around 20 meters above mean water level for the upper edge of the carriageway, so that the supporting structure could be arranged under the carriageway, which has a one-sided gradient of 1:200. The fixed bearings of the central girder are designed as tilting bearings and consist of an upper saddle piece and the lower bearing body with the spherical trunnion. The height of the embankment support can be adjusted by up to 20 cm if the fill should settle. The designers used a finger construction to adjust the Grunewald support for changes of up to ± 14 cm due to the expected movements of the embankment support. The cantilever is 29.17 meters, resulting in a span of 20.83 meters for the towing girders. The four main girders run parallel to the roadway as truss girders in the upper chord and only in the middle section of the lower chord. The infill consists of strut trusses. The lower chord is strongly curved for ""aesthetic reasons"". ""The eye of the beholder"" should follow its clear lines.Karl Bernhard: Stößensee- und Havelbrücke im Zuge der ..., p. 327, 341 ff.

The mighty Grunewald pillar consists of four supporting pillars stiffened by reinforced concrete vaults, which in turn support the earth. The pillar is largely clad with rough embossed granite and partly paved with boulders. At the bridgehead, it widens out into a viewing platform. The end piers on the embankment are in three parts, carry the bridge bearings and support the backfill. As the sandy embankment side does not form a fixed support point, the main load falls on the central pillar, which stands in the middle of the approximately 100-metre-long section next to the open shipping channel. It carries a total load of 3,900 tons, which is distributed over piles set into the ground at one-metre intervals, each carrying a load of 20 tons. The foundation base rests on the piles, which are around 3.14 meters below mean water level (29.81 m above sea level) and around 2.30 meters below low water level (28.97 m above sea level). The bank has a height of two meters and the round support stones, whose upper edge is 1.09 meters above high water (31.25 m above sea level), have a diameter of 2.43 meters. Brickwork on the central pillar was out of the question in order to protect the natural surroundings and keep the view clear. It was therefore formed from four cage arches with three centers, which initially rise steeply from the low-lying bearing and then merge tangentially into the lower chords of the truss girders, which rise slightly at the ends. The four main girders are spaced 5.85 meters apart. The outer main girders support the footpaths on cantilever arms, while the roadway is suspended from the inner main girders on short cantilever arms. The total road width is 24 meters, four of which are for the footpaths and 16 for the carriageway. For the main girders, Bernhard originally assumed a load of 500 kg/m2 for the carriageway and footpaths.Karl Bernhard: Stößensee- und Havelbrücke im Zuge der ..., pp. 326-331, 335.

The supporting structure was made of river iron, the bearings, joints and expansion devices of cast iron. The substructure was built by Aktiengesellschaft für Hoch- und Tiefbau, Frankfurt/Main, the superstructure by the Berlin company Belter und Schneevogel. Construction of the bridge began in 1908 and was completed a year later. On the two sidewalks on the Charlottenburg side, two massive granite gates announce the bridge. They open up steep steps that lead down the slope to the Havelchaussee and the lake (there is a narrow sliding lane for bicycles next to the southern steps). The Havelhöhenweg also begins at the southern portal.

Bernhard also retained his concept of achieving aesthetics without architectural additions for the Stößensee Bridge. The structural ""design of the cantilevers in connection with the main girders, the edge girders with the railings, i.e. the entire footpaths projecting over the main girders"" illustrates, as Bernhard writes, the ""uniform architectural effect of the pure iron construction without architectural additions"".Karl Bernhard: Stößensee- und Havelbrücke im Zuge der ..., p. 325, 344, quote p. 332.

 Reconstruction, repairs and transit traffic 

The bridge was destroyed during the Second World War. Like the Freybrücke,Pichelsdorf (Memento from February 23, 2009 in the Internet Archive) History of Pichelsdorf. it was most likely blown up by the German Wehrmacht in 1945 to prevent the Soviet troops from advancing further towards Berlin. Reconstruction took place between 1948 and 1951.Kiezspaziergang on October 9, 2004 along the Havelhöhenweg with district mayor Monika Thiemen and forester Ruthenberg. Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf district office.The information on the destruction of the bridge is not 100% certain. There is information, albeit without further evidence, that the bridge was prepared for demolition but was not blown up. The entry 09085599 in the Berlin State Monument List contains no reference to its destruction or reconstruction. According to the entry in the state monument list, the bridge was rebuilt in 1959. From July to October 2001, the state of Berlin carried out repair work because the south-western base had started to lean. In addition, the paved embankment cone in this area showed settlement cracks and deformations. Traffic on the bridge was able to continue during this time, albeit somewhat restricted.Work on the Stößensee Bridge in Spandau. Senate Department for Urban Development, press box, July 12, 2001.

At the time of the division of Germany, transit traffic to Hamburg flowed over the Stößensee Bridge. Before the expansion of the Autobahn 24, the connection was also the only transit route in the form of a country road, so that it could also be used by cyclists between West Berlin and the former federal territory. Today, Heerstraße is one of many entry and exit roads that connect Berlin city center with the western districts and the surrounding areas of Brandenburg, including the Havelpark shopping center in Dallgow-Döberitz and the factory outlet center in Elstal, as well as the Berlin freeway ring (junction 26 - Berlin-Spandau). The continuation of the Heerstraße as the B 5 in the federal state of Brandenburg is called Hamburger Chaussee. It leads into Havelland, crosses the Berlin ring road and runs via Hamburg to the Danish border. Currently (as of 2010) around 70,000 vehicles cross the Stößensee Bridge every day.Olaf Wedekind: Avus: 2011 will be the worst year for traffic jams. In: B.Z., November 30, 2010. Note: The information contained in the article refers to the Frey Bridge. As both bridges are directly adjacent, it also applies to the Stößensee Bridge.

40,31417,5337041,6332,Liberty Road (France),"Liberty Road (French La voie de la Liberté) is the commemorative way marking the route of the Allied forces from D-Day in June 1944. It starts in Sainte-Mère-Eglise, in the Manche département in Normandy, France, travels across Northern France to Metz and then northwards to end in Bastogne in Belgium, on the border of Luxembourg. At each of the 1,146 kilometres, there is a stone marker or 'Borne'. The first lies outside the town hall in Sainte-Mère-Église.

 History 

Soon after the end of World War II, Guy de la Vasselais, mayor of Bleury-Saint-Symphorien, previously French liaison officer to George S. Patton, suggested the idea of erecting a monument to commemorate the Liberation of France by the American Armies: a monument that would symbolize the idea of Liberty.  He proposed installation of a distinctive marker placed at each kilometre interval along the roads followed by General Patton's Third United States Army.

Beginning at Utah Beach in Normandy and ending at Bastogne in Belgium, the Liberty Road goes through the cities of Saint Malo, Rennes, Angers, Le Mans, Chartres, Fontainebleau, Reims, Verdun and Metz, and then through the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Altogether the Monument consists of 1146 Milestones. The design of these Milestones is symbolic: The Flaming Torch of Liberty, emerging from the sea, is carried eastward. Along the circumference of the Milestone's dome-shaped top, the 48 stars representing the (then) 48 United States which took part in the Liberation of France.

The “Liberty Highway” was officially opened on September 17, 1947 at Fontainebleau, by Mr Paul Ramadier, then President du Conseil, in the presence of Mr Jefferson Caffery, United States Ambassador to France and members of the American Legion. Many military and civilian dignitaries of the Allied Nations were also present at the ceremonies.

President Ronald Reagan, accompanied by many heads of State, visited the first borne in 1984 to mark the 40th anniversary of D-Day.

The last pitched battle between Scotland and England before the Union of the Crowns, it was part of the conflict known as the Rough Wooing. It was a catastrophic defeat for Scotland, where it became known as ""Black Saturday"".Phillips, p. 193 A highly detailed and illustrated English account of the battle and campaign authored by an eyewitness William Patten was published in London as propaganda four months after the battle.Marcus Merriman, The Rough Wooings: Mary Queen of Scots, 1542–1551 (Tuckwell: East Linton, 2000), pp. 7–8.

Background
In the last years of his reign, King Henry VIII of England tried to secure an alliance with Scotland by the marriage of the infant Mary, Queen of Scots, to his young son, the future Edward VI. When diplomacy failed, and Scotland was on the point of an alliance with France, he launched a war against Scotland that has become known as the Rough Wooing. The war also had a religious aspect; some Scots opposed an alliance that would bring religious Reformation on English terms. During the battle, the Scots taunted the English soldiers as ""loons"" (persons of no consequence. A “loon” in Scots and Doric is a male child), ""tykes,"" and ""heretics"". The Earl of Angus, who is said to have arrived with monks ""the professors of the Gospel"", the heavy pikemen of the Lowlands, eight thousand strong, was in the lead.

When Henry VIII died in 1547, Edward Seymour, maternal uncle of Edward VI, became Lord Protector and Duke of Somerset, with (initially) unchallenged power. He continued the policy of seeking forcible alliance with Scotland by demanding both the marriage of Mary to Edward, and the imposition of an Anglican Reformation on the Scottish Church. Early in September, he led a well-equipped army into Scotland, supported by a large fleet.Phillips, pp. 178–183 The Earl of Arran, Scottish Regent at the time, was forewarned by letters from Adam Otterburn, his representative in London, who had observed English war preparations.Annie I. Cameron, Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine (Edinburgh: SHS, 1927), pp. 192–194. Otterburn may have seen the leather horse armour made by the workshops of Nicholas Bellin of Modena and Hans Hunter.Stuart W. Pyhrr, Donald J. La Rocca, Dirk H. Breiding, The Armored Horse in Europe, 1480–1620 (New York, 2005), pp. 57–58: Nicolas Bellin's account, National Archives TNA E101/504/8, photograph by AALT.

Campaign

Somerset's army was partly composed of the traditional county levies, summoned by Commissions of Array and armed with longbow and bill as they had been at the Battle of Flodden, thirty years before. However, Somerset also had several hundred German mercenary arquebusiers, a large and well-appointed artillery train, and 6,000 cavalry, including a contingent of Spanish and Italian mounted arquebusiers under Pedro de Gamboa.Phillips, p. 186 The cavalry were commanded by Lord Grey of Wilton, as High Marshal of the Army, and the infantry by the Earl of Warwick, Lord Dacre of Gillesland, and Somerset himself. William Patten, an officer of the English army, recorded its numbers as 16,800 fighting men and 1,400 ""pioneers"" or labourers.

Somerset advanced along the east coast of Scotland to maintain contact with his fleet and thereby keep in supply. Scottish border reivers harassed his troops but could impose no major check to their advance.Phillips, p. 183 The English captured and slighted Innerwick Castle and Thornton Castle.William Patten, The Late Expedition into Scotland (1548), in A. E. Pollard, Tudor Tracts (London, 1903), pp. 86–89 He camped at Longniddry on 7 September.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 38 no. 78.

To the west, a diversionary English invasion of 5,000 men was led by Thomas Wharton and the Scottish dissident Earl of Lennox. On 8 September they took Castlemilk in Annandale and burnt Annan after a bitter struggle to capture its fortified church.Patrick Fraser Tytler, History of Scotland, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1879), p. 63: Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 19 no. 42.

To oppose the English south of Edinburgh, the Earl of Arran had raised a large army, consisting mainly of pikemen with contingents of Highland archers. Arran also had large numbers of guns, but these were apparently not as mobile or as well-served as Somerset's. Arran had his artillery refurbished in August, after the siege of St Andrews Castle, with new gunstocks made from woods of ""Aberdagy"" and Inverleith. The Lord Treasurer's account describes this work as preparation ""against the feild of Pynkie Cleuch.""James Balfour Paul, Accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1911), p. 105.

Arran's cavalry consisted of 2,000 lightly equipped riders under the Earl of Home, most of whom were potentially unreliable Borderers. His infantry and pikemen were commanded by the Earl of Angus, the Earl of Huntly and Arran himself.Phillips, pp. 181–182 According to Huntly, the Scottish army numbered 22,000 or 23,000 men, while an English source claimed that it comprised 36,000.

Arran occupied the slopes on the west bank of the River Esk to bar Somerset's progress. The Firth of Forth was on his left flank, and a large bog protected his right. Some fortifications were constructed in which cannon and arquebuses were mounted. Some guns pointed out into the Forth to keep English warships at a distance.

Prelude

At Monktonhall on 8 September Regent Arran made an act to protect the rights of the children and heirs of those men who would be killed fighting the English. James IV of Scotland had made a similar act at Twizell before Flodden in 1513.George Powell McNeill, Exchequer Rolls, 18 (Edinburgh, 1898), pp. lxvi-lxx: Patrick Fraser Tytler, History of Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1841), p. 57: Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1814), p. 278.
On 9 September part of Somerset's army occupied Falside Hill  east of Arran's main position, after Falside Castle put up a slight resistance.David Caldwell, Vicky Oleksy, Bess Rhodes, The Battle of Pinkie, 1547 (Oxbow, 2023), p. 192.

In an outdated chivalric gesture, the Earl of Home led 1,500 horsemen close to the English encampment and challenged an equal number of English cavalry to fight. With Somerset's reluctant approval, Lord Grey accepted the challenge and engaged the Scots with 1,000 heavily armoured men-at-arms and 500 lighter demi-lancers, led by Jacques Granado and others.A. F. Pollard, Tudor Tracts (London, 1903), p. 100 The Scottish horsemen were badly cut up and were pursued west for . This action cost Arran most of his cavalry.Phillips, pp. 191–192 The Scots lost around 800 men in the skirmish. Lord Home was badly wounded, and his sons were taken prisoner.

Later on the same day, Somerset sent a detachment with guns to occupy the Inveresk Slopes, which overlooked the Scottish position. During the night, Somerset received two more challenges from Arran. One request was for Somerset and Arran to settle the dispute by single combat; another was for 20 champions from each side to decide the matter. Somerset rejected both proposals.

Battle

On the morning of Saturday, 10 September, Somerset advanced his army, seeking to position his artillery at Inveresk. In response Arran moved his army across the Esk by the ""Roman bridge"", and advanced rapidly to meet him. Arran may have seen movement in the English lines and assumed that the English were trying to retreat to their ships. Arran knew himself to be outmatched in artillery and therefore tried to force close combat before the English artillery could be deployed.

Arran's left wing came under fire from English ships offshore. Their advance meant that the guns at their former position could no longer protect them. They were thrown into disorder and pushed into Arran's own division in the centre.

On the other flank, Somerset threw in his cavalry to delay the Scots' advance. The English cavalry was at a disadvantage, as they had left their horses' body armour at the camp. The Scottish pikemen drove them off, inflicting heavy casualties.David Caldwell, Vicky Oleksy, Bess Rhodes, The Battle of Pinkie, 1547 (Oxbow, 2023), p. 108. Lord Grey himself was wounded by a pike thrust through his throat and into his mouth.Phillips, p. 196 At one point, Scottish pikemen surrounded Sir Andrew Flammack, the bearer of the King's Standard. He was rescued by Sir Ralph Coppinger, and managed to hold onto the standard, despite its staff breaking.

The Scottish army was by now stalled and under heavy fire on three sides, from the ships, land artillery, arquebusiers and archers, to which they had no reply. When they broke, the English cavalry rejoined the battle following a vanguard of 300 experienced soldiers under the command of Sir John Luttrell. Many of the retreating Scots were slaughtered or drowned as they tried to swim the fast-flowing Esk or cross the bogs.Phillips, pp. 197–199
 
The English eye-witness William Patten described the slaughter inflicted on the Scots;

Imperial ambassador's accounts of the battle

The Imperial ambassador François van der Delft went to the court of King Edward VI at Oatlands Palace to hear the news of the battle from William Paget. Van der Delft wrote to the Queen Dowager, Mary of Hungary, with his version of the news on 19 September. He described the cavalry skirmish on the day before the battle. He had heard that on the day of the battle, when the English army encountered the Scottish formation, the Scots advance horsemen dismounted and crossed their lances, which they used like pikes standing in close formation. Van der Delft was told that the Earl of Warwick then attempted to attack the Scots from behind using smoking fires as a diversion. When they engaged the Scottish rearguard the Scots took flight, apparently following some who already had an understanding with the Protector Somerset. The rest of the Scots army then attempted to flee the field.Calendar State Papers Spanish: 1547–1549, vol. 9 (London, 1912), pp. 150–153.

Van der Delft wrote a shorter description for Prince Philip on 21 October. In this account he lays emphasis on the Scots attempting to change position. He said the Scots crossed the brook in order to occupy two hills which flanked both armies. The Scottish army, ""without any need whatever were seized with panic and began to fly"".Calendar State Papers Spanish: 1547–1549, vol. 9 (London, 1912), pp. 181–182. Another letter with derivative news of the battle was sent by John Hooper in Switzerland to the Reformer Henry Bullinger. Hooper mentions that Scots had to abandon their artillery due to the archers commanded by the Earl of Warwick, and when the Scots changed position the sun was in their eyes. He was told there were 15,000 Scottish casualties and 2,000 prisoners. There were 17,000 English in the field and 30,000 Scots. Hooper's letter is undated but he includes the false early report that Mary of Guise surrendered in person to Somerset after the battle.Hastings Robinson, Original Letters Relative to the Reformation (Cambridge: Parker Society, 1846), pp. 43–44 Letter XXIV. These newsletters, though compiled and written by non-combatants days after the battle and far from the battlefield, are nevertheless important sources for the historian and for reconstruction of the events, to compare with Patten's narrative and archaeological evidence from the field.

Aftermath

Although they had suffered a resounding defeat, the Scottish government refused to come to terms. The infant Queen Mary was smuggled out of the country to France to be betrothed to the young Dauphin of France, Francis. Somerset occupied several Scottish strongholds and large parts of the Lowlands and Borders but, without peace, these garrisons became a useless drain on the Treasury.Phillips, p. 252

Analysis
Although the Scots blamed traitors for the defeat, it may be fairer to say that a Renaissance army defeated a medieval army. Henry VIII had taken steps towards creating standing naval and land forces which formed the nucleus of the fleet and army that gave Somerset the victory. However, the military historian Gervase Phillips has defended Scottish tactics, pointing out that Arran moved from his position by the Esk as a rational response to English manoeuvres by sea and land. In his 1877 account of the battle, Major Sadleir Stoney commented that ""every amateur knows that changing front in presence of an enemy is a perilous operation"".F. Sadlier Stoney, Life and Times of Ralph Sadleir (Longman: London, 1877), p. 109. Early commentators such as John Knox had focused on the move as the cause of the defeat and attributed the order to move to the influence of local landowners George Durie, Abbot of Dunfermline, and Hugh Rig of Carberry.David Laing, Works of John Knox: History of the Reformation in Scotland, vol. 1 (Wodrow Society: Edinburgh, 1846), p. 211. Marcus Merriman sees the initial Scottish field encampment as the most sophisticated ever erected in Scotland, let down by their cavalry numbers.Marcus Merriman, The Rough Wooings (Tuckwell: East Linton, 2000), p. 236.

Gervase Phillips maintains the defeat may be considered due to a crisis of morale after the English cavalry charge, and notes William Patten's praise of the Earl of Angus's pikemen.Gervase Phillips, 'Tactics', Scottish Historical Review (Oct. 1998), pp. 172–173. Merriman regards Somerset's failure to press on and capture Edinburgh and Leith as a loss of ""a magnificent opportunity"" and ""a massive blunder"" which cost him the war.Marcus Merriman, The Rough Wooings (Tuckwell: East Linton, 2000), pp. 236–237. In 1548, the Scottish Master of Artillery, Lord Methven, gave his opinion that the battle was lost due to growing support in Scotland for English policy, and the mis-order and great haste of the Scottish army on the day.Annie I. Cameron, The Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine (Scottish History Society: Edinburgh, 1927) pp. 242–243, Methven to Mary of Guise, 3 June 1548.

The naval bombardment was an important aspect of the battle. The English navy was commanded by Lord Clinton and comprised 34 warships with 26 support vessels.Albert F. Pollard, Tudor Tracts (London, 1903), p. 78 William Patten mentions the Galley Subtle, captained by Richard Broke,John Bennell, 'The Oared Vessels', David Loades & Charles Knighton, The Anthony Roll of Henry VIII's Navy (Ashgate, 2000), p. 35. as one of the ships at the battle, and included it in one of his plans, depicted in the woodcut with its oars visible, close to Musselburgh.Albert F. Pollard, Tudor Tracts (London, 1903), pp. 115, 135: E. R. Adair, 'English Galleys in the Sixteenth Century', English Historical Review, 35:140 (October 1920), pp. 499–500 The guns of the ships in English fleet were recorded in an inventory. The Galley Subtle carried two brass demi-cannons, two brass Flanders demi-culverins, breech-loading iron double basses and single basses.David Starkey, Inventory of Henry VIII (London, 1998), p. 155 nos. 7950–7959. The galleys could be brought near the shore by their rowers.David Caldwell, Vicky Oleksy, Bess Rhodes, The Battle of Pinkie, 1547 (Oxbow, 2023), pp. 51, 243. After the battle, Andrew Dudley and Michael Durham sailed to Broughty Castle in the Galley Subtle and fired three shots, effecting its surrender.Marcus Merriman, The Rough Wooings (East Linton, Tuckwell, 2000), p. 250.

Scottish artillery
Warned of the approach of the English army, the Scottish artillery was made ready at Edinburgh Castle. Extra gunners were recruited and 140 pioneers, i.e. workmen, were employed by Duncan Dundas to move the guns. On 2 September carts were hired to take the guns and the Scottish tents and pavilions towards Musselburgh. There were horses, and oxen were supplied by the Laird of Elphinstone. John Drummond of Milnab, master carpenter of the Scottish ordnance, led the wagon train. There was a newly painted banner, and ahead a boy played on the ""swesche"", a drum used to alert people. Accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1911), pp. 112–120.""Swesch"" see 'Swesche n. 1', Scottish Language Dictionaries, Edinburgh, DOST: Dictionary of the Scottish Language

William Patten described the English officers of the Ordnance after the battle retrieving 30 of the Scottish guns, which were left lying in sundry places, on Sunday 11 September. They found one brass culverin, 3 brass sakers, 9 smaller brass pieces, and 17 other iron guns mounted on carriages.William Patten, The Expedition into Scotland, 1547 (London, 1548), reprinted in, Tudor Tracts, (London, 1903), p. 136. Some of these guns appear in the English royal inventory of 1547–48, at the Tower of London where sixteen Scottish brass guns were recorded. They were a demi-cannon, 2 culverins, 3 sakers, 9 falconets, and a robinet.David Starkey, The Inventory of Henry VIII, vol. 1 (Society of Antiquaries: London, 1998), p. 102, nos. 3707–3712.

Account of the English Treasurer General of the Army
Ralph Sadler was treasurer for Somerset's expedition in Scotland from 1 August to 20 November 1547. On 22 August, he informed the Earl of shrewsbury that ships were ready to sail to Aberlady with provisions.Joseph Stevenson, Selections from unpublished manuscripts illustrating the reign of Mary Queen of Scotland (Glasgow, 1837), p. 21. The expense of the journey northwards cost £7468-12s–10d, and the return was £6065-14s–4d. Soldiers' wages were £26,299-7s–1d. For his own expenses, Sadler had £211-14s–8d with £258-14s–9d for his equipment and auditor's expenses. A number of special rewards were given to spies, Scottish guides, and others who gave good service, and to the captain of the Spanish mercenaries. The Scottish herald at the battlefield was given 100 shillings. When Sadler's account was audited in December 1547, Sadler was found to owe Edward VI £546-13s–11d which he duly returned.Arthur Clifford, Sadler State Papers, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1809), pp. 353–364.

Today

The battle site is now in East Lothian. The battle took place most probably in the cultivated ground  south-east of Inveresk Church, just to the south of the main East Coast railway line. There are two vantage points for viewing the ground. Fa'side Castle above the village of Wallyford was just behind the English position, and with the aid of binoculars, a visitor can get a good view of the battle area though the Scottish position is now obscured by buildings. The best impression of their position is obtained from the golf course west of the River Esk and just off the B6415 road. The Scottish centre occupied ground a few yards west of the clubhouse. The Inveresk eminence, an important tactical feature at the time of the battle, is now built over, but from it, a visitor can get down to the Esk and walk for some way along the bank. The walk gives a further idea of a part of the Scottish position, but the town of Musselburgh now completely covers the left of the line.William Seymour, Battles in Britain: 1066–1547 vol. 1 (Sidgewick & Jackson, 1979), p. 208. The battlefield was added to the Inventory of Historic Battlefields in Scotland in 2011.

A stone commemorating the battle has been erected southwest of Wallyford village near the junction of Salters Road and the A1 road. The stone is carved with St. Andrew's Cross, the English rose and Scottish thistle and the name and date of the battle. It is situated on the north side of the driveway to the home that is in the northwest corner of the intersection. Co-ordinates: 55.9302992°N 3.0210942°W.

In September 2017 the Scottish Battlefields Trust staged the first major re-enactment of the battle in the grounds of Newhailes House. Such re-enactments are intended to continue on a triennial cycle.Event Scotland, 2017 re-enactment by the Scottish Battlefields Trust.

Casualties
Some of the injured soldiers were treated by Lockhart, a barber surgeon from Dunbar.James Balfour Paul, Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1911), p. 160. David H. Caldwell has written, ""English estimates put the slaughter as high as 15,000 Scots killed and 2,000 taken but the Earl of Huntly's figure of 6,000 dead is probably nearer the truth."" Of the Scottish prisoners, few were nobles or gentlemen. It was claimed that most were dressed much the same as common soldiers and therefore were not recognised as being worth ransoming. Caldwell says of the English casualties, ""Officially it was given out that losses were only 200 though the rumour about the English court, fed by private letters from those in the army, indicated that 500 or 600 was more likely.""

William Patten names a number of high-ranking casualties. The Englishmen he names were horsemen forced onto Scottish pikes in a ploughed field to the east of the English position, after they had crossed a slough towards the Scottish position on Falside Brae.Patten, (1548), other English names not immediately recognisable.

43,44998,76285063,15691,Cupra (marque),"SEAT Cupra S.A.U., trading as Cupra (; stylised in all caps) is a subsidiary of Spanish car manufacturer SEAT, which is part of Volkswagen Group. It is headquartered in Martorell near Barcelona, Spain.

Originating from SEAT's motorsport division Cupra Racing, the Cupra brand was introduced as a standalone brand in January 2018, after being used as a performance sub-brand of SEAT since 1996. While initial Cupra models are based on SEAT vehicles, in September 2020 Cupra introduced the first Cupra-only vehicle, the Cupra Formentor. In 2021, the brand introduced its first electric car called the Cupra Born.

 History 
Cupra originated from Cupra Racing (previously SEAT Sport), the high-performance motorsport subsidiary of SEAT. The ""Cupra"" name, short for ""Cup Racing"" was first used in 1996 by the SEAT Ibiza GTI 2.0 16V Cupra Sport. It is a street legal version of the Ibiza Mk2 kit car used in the competition, created as a special edition to celebrate SEAT's victory in the 1996 FIA 2-Litre World Rally Cup, a subdivision of the World Rally Championship at that time. It was followed by the SEAT Ibiza Cupra 1.8 20V in 1999, and the more powerful Ibiza Cupra R in 2000.

Over the following two decades, SEAT introduced a succession of hot hatchbacks marketed with the Cupra badge, such as the SEAT León Cupra 1.8 20V in 1999, and in the following year the SEAT Leon Cupra 4, which is the first AWD Cupra and the only six-cylinder Cupra. Since then, every SEAT León generation has been supplemented with a Cupra-badged hot hatch version.

In 2017, then SEAT CEO Luca de Meo hinted at the possibility of Cupra becoming a standalone brand. At that point, Cupra was only available as the performance version of the León. On 31 January 2018, SEAT confirmed that it is launching Cupra as a standalone brand, followed by an announcement event on 22 February 2018, in which prototypes of forthcoming Cupra models such as the Cupra Ateca were shown. SEAT's head of sales and marketing  Wayne Griffiths planned to double Cupra sales within the following four to five years, helping SEAT achieve sustainable profitability. Cupra cars were to be sold in some SEAT dealerships in Europe, with dedicated floor space.

The Cupra logo of two intersecting triangles was designed by Alejandro Mesonero-Romanos. According to Mesonero-Romanos, the philosophy of the triangular logo is that a triangle is a dynamic shape, has a stable base, and points in a clear direction.

The first model from the standalone Cupra brand was the Cupra Ateca, introduced in October 2018. The Cupra León joined the line-up in February 2020, following the introduction of the SEAT León Mk4. In March 2020, Cupra introduced the Formentor after being previewed as a near-production concept vehicle at the Geneva International Motor Show in November 2019. It is the first Cupra product that is not shared with SEAT.

In February 2021, the Cupra Born was introduced as Cupra's first electric car. The concept version was called SEAT el-Born, but the Born became a Cupra-only model while remaining closely related to the Volkswagen ID.3. The second electric car from Cupra is the Tavascan, launched in April 2023, which was preceded by the Tavascan concept car shown at the 2019 Frankfurt Motor Show. It is the first Cupra model produced outside Europe, made by Volkswagen Anhui in China.

In March 2024, Cupra announced its intention to enter the U.S. market ""by the end of the decade"". The planned models to be sold are the next-generation electric Formentor, and an unnamed larger electric vehicle to be produced in Mexico.

46,36281,5352487,8085,Maureen Hicks,"Maureen Patricia Hicks (née Cutler; 23 February 1948 – 13 February 2024) was a British politician who was the Conservative Member of Parliament for Wolverhampton North East from 1987 to 1992.

Early life
Maureen Patricia Cutler was born in Burton-on-Sea, Hampshire on 23 February 1948. She was educated at Furzedown College of Education.

From 1969 to 1970, as Maureen Cutler, she was a secondary school teacher of drama and English.  She was also a lecturer.  From 1970 to 1974 she was an assistant staff manager at Marks and Spencer.  From 1974 to 1976, she was an assistant area education officer.

Maureen Hicks was heavily involved in local tourism at Stratford-upon-Avon, whilst realising the necessity to remain sensitive to the needs of the local residents. She was a former member of the Heart of England Tourist Board executive, and director of Stratford-upon-Avon Motor Museum from 1976 to 1982. In 1978 she helped to form Stratford-upon-Avon and District Marketing, which brought together hotels, retailers and attractions with District Council support.

Hicks served as a councillor in Stratford upon Avon District Council from 1979 to 1984.

Member of Parliament
In the 1987 general election, Hicks stood as the Conservative candidate for the Wolverhampton North East constituency.  It had been a Labour seat for many years but had become marginal in the 1983 Conservative landslide.  The constituency's previous Labour MP, Renee Short, had retired and was replaced as Labour candidate by Ken Purchase.  Despite the small overall national swing to Labour, Hicks gained the seat against the tide with a swing of 0.5% to the Conservatives, winning by just 204 votes (0.4% of the total).

Once a Member of Parliament, Hicks made her maiden speech on 1 December 1987, during a House of Commons debate on an Education Reform Bill.  She was a member of the Conservative backbench tourism committee until 1990, and a member of the Select Committee on Education, Science and the Arts.  For the remainder of her time in the House of Commons, she was a parliamentary private secretary for the Earl of Caithness and for Mark Lennox-Boyd, Minister of State and Under Secretary of State respectively for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

Hicks stood for re-election in the 1992 general election in her Wolverhampton North East seat.  The polls were pointing towards a national swing to the Labour Party and her chances of retaining the seat were never rated highly.  She used a battle bus in her campaign to be re-elected, adopting Tina Turner’s song ""Simply the Best,"" to be played out as the bus drove in the streets of her constituency, saying she had chosen a song by a strong woman to emphasise her own credentials as a steely female.

In the event, Hicks polled 20,167 votes, numerically more than she had achieved in 1987, and her share of the vote fell by just 0.5%.  Ken Purchase, who was running again for Labour, enjoyed an increase of 7.6% in his share of the vote, mostly at the expense of the Liberal Democrats' candidate.  Hicks thus lost her seat by 3,939 votes (8.1%) to Purchase on a 4.2% swing to Labour.  The election declaration was broadcast on ITN's Election Special.

After the House of Commons
Following Hicks's defeat, she re-located to Stratford-upon-Avon, where she was appointed by the local council to a role as town centre manager, and was involved in plans to develop the town's Bell Court Shopping Centre.  She was a project director for the Stratford-upon-Avon Visitor Management Action Programme (VMAP), and was a founder member of the Shakespeare Country Association of Tourist Attractions (SCATA) - which includes the Royal Shakespeare Company, Warwick Castle, Anne Hathaway's Cottage and other Shakespeare Birthplace Trust properties.

In November 1995, the Conservative MP for Stratford-upon-Avon, Alan Howarth, announced that he was defecting to the Labour party. The local Conservative association quickly moved to select a new candidate to replace him for the 1997 general election. Hicks, as a local candidate, put her name forward and made a shortlist of six candidates, but she lost the nomination to John Maples, the former MP for Lewisham West who had also lost his seat in the 1992 general election.

Hicks held a number of directorships, including for Earl Mountbatten Hospice in Newport, Isle of Wight.

Personal life and death
Hicks's interests in Who's Who included golf, music and travel.

In 1973, she married Keith Hicks. They had a son and a daughter. Maureen Hicks died in Stratford-upon-Avon on 13 February 2024, at the age of 75.",2025-04-03,"['1948 births' '2024 deaths'

47,17786,75501311,4719,Orężna,"Orężna  is a neighbourhood of Piaseczno, Poland, located in the western part of the town, in the Warsaw metropolitan area.

History
The settlement was established in 1801 under the name Świniary, which came from the word świnia, which means ""pig"", as the inhabitants were engaged in pig farming. In 1820 it was renamed Orężna after the Polish word oręż, which means ""weapon"".

In the interwar period, it was administratively located in the Warsaw County in the Warsaw Voivodeship. According to the 1921 census, the village had a population of 115, entirely Polish by nationality, 68.7% Roman Catholic and 31.3% Lutheran by confession.

Following the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, Orężna was occupied by Germany. In 1944, local man Bolesław Grzywaczewski hid two Polish resistance members in Orężna. The following day, two Ukrainian auxiliaries arrived to find the partisans. The partisans threw a grenade at them, killing, according to various testimonies, either one or both of the Ukrainians. In retaliation, on August 4, 1944, either the Germans or Ukrainians pacified the village, murdering three women, a man and a 5-year-old girl, then captured nine men and one woman and massacred them in nearby Zalesie Dolne (see Nazi crimes against the Polish nation).

Orężna was included within the town limits of Piaseczno as its new neighbourhood in 1952.",2025-01-24,"['Piaseczno County' 'Neighbourhoods in Poland'

48,59479,76711912,12185,Nick Zachernuk,"Nick Zachernuk (born September 17, 1997) is a Canadian curler from Halifax, Nova Scotia. He currently plays lead on Team Matthew Manuel. He is a two-time defending Nova Scotia Tankard champion and a four-time Nova Scotia junior champion.

Career
Youth
In his junior career, Zachernuk won four straight Nova Scotia junior championships from 2015 to 2018 with skip Matthew Manuel. The duos first two titles came with teammates Ryan Abraham and Alec Cameron. At the 2015 Canadian Junior Curling Championships, the team lost in a tiebreaker 6–4 to Ontario's Mac Calwell, finishing tenth overall with a 4–5 record. The following year, they again finished in tenth at the 2016 Canadian Junior Curling Championships, this time with a 5–4 record. During their time together, the team also represented Nova Scotia at the 2015 Canada Winter Games. After a 4–1 round robin record, they lost in the quarterfinals 8–4 to Ontario's Matthew Hall.

Following the 2015–16 season, Abraham left the team and was replaced by Adam Cocks. The team continued to dominate provincially, securing the 2017 and 2018 Nova Scotia junior titles. At the 2017 Canadian Junior Curling Championships, they just missed the playoffs with a 5–4 record, settling for fifth. In 2018, the team had their best showing with a 6–4 record, finishing sixth and just missing the tiebreakers. In their last year of juniors, Team Manuel lost in the final of the provincial championship to Graeme Weagle.

In university curling, Zachernuk played for the Dalhousie Tigers at three straight U Sports curling championships from 2016 to 2018. As lead on the team skipped by Robert Mayhew, the team got better at each appearance but never managed to reach the playoffs. They finished with a 2–5 record in 2016, 3–4 record in 2017 and 4–3 record in 2018.

Men's
After juniors, Zachernuk took two seasons off before coming back to Team Manuel for the 2021–22 season. With third Luke Saunders and second Jeffrey Meagher, Team Manuel qualified in two of their five events. After a quarterfinal finish at the Dave Jones Mayflower Cashspiel, the team made it to the final of the Superstore Monctonian Challenge where they lost to James Grattan. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Nova Scotia, the 2022 provincial championship was cancelled. The Nova Scotia Curling Association then decided to appoint Team Paul Flemming to represent Nova Scotia at the 2022 Tim Hortons Brier. The following season, the Manuel rink continued to build on their success from the previous year, reaching the final of the New Scotland Brewing Men's Cash Spiel and the semifinals of the Stu Sells 1824 Halifax Classic and the Superstore Monctonian Challenge. At the 2023 Nova Scotia Tankard, the team lost their first game before rattling off seven straight victories to become both the B and C qualifiers. They then lost the first playoff game against Owen Purcell, forcing a sudden death final. Tied 4–4 in the tenth, Team Manuel stole a single point for the 5–4 victory and their first provincial men's title. This qualified the team of Manuel, Saunders, Meagher and Zachernuk for the 2023 Tim Hortons Brier where they finished with a 3–5 record, earning wins against the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Saskatchewan.

Throughout the 2023–24 tour season, the Manuel rink only qualified in three of seven events and did not reach any finals. They had two semifinal finishes in Halifax and Moncton and a quarterfinal result at the Challenge de Curling Desjardins. Despite this, the team dominated at the 2024 Ocean Contractors Tankard, winning all five of their games. This included three victories against the Purcell rink who were ranked higher before the event began. This sent the team to the 2024 Montana's Brier in Regina, Saskatchewan. After struggling out of the gate with three consecutive losses, the team found their footing, rallying off wins against higher seeds Alberta's Aaron Sluchinski, Saskatchewan's Mike McEwen and Alberta's Kevin Koe. They then lost to Nunavut in their penultimate game, eliminating them from contention. They ended on a high note with a victory over Quebec to finish with an even 4–4 record.

Personal life
Zachernuk is employed as an engineer at Lockheed Martin Canada. He is engaged.

49,5967,75137162,6055,"Embassy of Russia, Budapest","Embassy of Russia in Budapest（ ; ）is the official diplomatic mission of the Russian Federation in the Republic of Hungary. The embassy was originally opened in 1934 as the Soviet embassy in Budapest, and has since became the Russian embassy since the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

 Background 
During the time of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the embassy of the Russian Empire only operated in Vienna, but it also kept a consulate in Budapest. The exact date of the establishment is not known, although it is between 1870 and 1875, since in 1870 there are reports of the plan to open the consulate, and in 1875 a consul general was already mentioned to be stationed in Budapest. In 1880, it is known that the consulate was at 2 V. Eötvös tér.

During the First World War, Russia and Austro-Hungary were warring states, and therefore had terminated their diplomatic relationship. Following the Russian Revolution, Hungary did not want to be associated with a communist state, owing to its own past of the brief Hungarian Soviet Republic. However, relations warmed between the two by 1924, and diplomatic relations were established that year. In 1934, the Soviet embassy in Budapest was opened, and continued until the Dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.

 History 
Since 1991, Hungary quickly established diplomatic relations with post-Soviet states, including the Russian Federation, which became official on December 6, 1991.

The House of Soviet Science and Culture on V. Semmelweis Street moved from its location in downtown Budapest in 1993, and renamed as the ""Russian Cultural Center"". Currently, the Center operates at Andrássy út 120, where the embassy club used to be located. The ceremonial opening of the cultural center took place on January 28, 1994.

The embassy building, today's building complex at Andrássy út 102–Bajza utca 35, has been in Soviet and later Russian ownership since 1945, which was the former residence of László Széchenyi and his wife Gladys Vanderbilt. Coincidentally, Széchenyi himself worked as a diplomat, and he was Hungary's first ambassador to the United States.

The Soviet Union opened a consulate in Debrecen in 1980. Russia continued to operate it from 1991, but then closed it in 1998 for financial reasons. In 2001, Hungary introduced a visa requirement for Russia, and Russia reopened the consulate later that year.",2024-11-04,"['Diplomatic missions of Russia' 'Diplomatic missions in Budapest'

She wrote and produced the track with Swedish producers Max Martin and Ilya Salmanzadeh. It is an uptempo dance-pop and disco-funk song sonically inspired by 1970s music. The song, rooted in self-awareness and accountability, sees Grande bidding farewell to her partner.

 Background and composition 
""Bye"" is two minutes and 45 seconds long. The song is a lavish and retro-inspired dance-pop, disco, and disco funk song with elements of Philadelphia soul echoing the sound of 1970s pop music. ""Bye"" features strings, adding in the disco influences throughout the song. Lyrically, Grande sings about how she is prepared to leave her partner, with her friend ready to pick her up. Taking place in the album's track list after ""Intro (End of the World)"", the song follows the theme of having accountability and self-awareness in a relationship.

 Critical reception 
Upon release, the song received positive reviews from music critics. Kyle Denis of Billboard called the song ""fantastic"", ranking it at number three in the parent album's track ranking. Denis praised the song's pre-chorus and the usage of funk and disco influences. Nick Levine, a writer at NME deemed the song an album highlight, saying Grande is ""playing disco diva"". In a review of the parent album, Rolling Stone and Variety likened the song to ""seventies pop"" with the latter publication likening the song's sound to Gamble and Huff and Beyoncé.

52,11588,5284179,6102,Petrocorii,"The Petrocorii were a Gallic tribe dwelling in the present-day Périgord region, between the Dordogne and Vézère rivers, during the Iron Age and the Roman period. 

Etymology
They are mentioned as Petrocoriis by Caesar (mid-1st c. BC),Caesar. Commentarii de Bello Gallico, 7:75:3. Petrokórioi (Πετροκόριοι) by Strabo (early 1st c. AD) and Ptolemy (2nd c. AD),Strabo. Geōgraphiká, 4:2:2; Ptolemy. Geōgraphikḕ Hyphḗgēsis, 2:7:9. Petrocori by Pliny (mid-1st c. AD),Pliny. Naturalis Historia, 4:109. and as Petrogorii by Sidonius Apollinaris (5th c. AD).Sidonius Apollinaris. Epistles, 7:6:7., s.v. Petrocori and Vesunna.

The Gaulish ethnonym Petrocorii means 'four armies', or 'four troops'. It derives from the Gaulish stem petru- ('four') attached to corios ('army'), after a Gallic custom of including numbers in tribal names (e.g. Vo-contii, Vo-corii, Tri-corii, Suess-iones). Their name may indicate a relatively recent formation emerging from the union of fragmented small ethnic groups.

The word corios derives from Proto-Celtic *koryos ('troop, tribe'; cf. Middle Welsh  'tribe, clan'; Mid. Ir. cuire), itself from Proto-Indo-European *kóryos, meaning 'army, people under arms'. The root is also found in other Gaulish tribal names such as the Tri-corii or the Corio-solites. The root petru- stems from Proto-Celtic *kʷetwór- ('four'; cf. OIr. cetheoir, OW. and OBret. petguar).

The city of Périgueux, attested ca. 400 AD as civitas Petrocoriorum ('civitas of the Petrocorii'; Petrecors in the 8th c., Periguhès in 1466), and the Périgord region, attested in the 7th c. AD as pagum Petrocorecum ('pagus of the Petrocorii'; Petragoricus in 781, Peiregore in the 12th c.), are named after the Gallic tribe.

 Geography 

The Petrocorii lived in the present-day Périgord region, between the Dordogne and Vézère rivers. Their territory was located south of the Lemovices and Santones, east of the Bituriges Vivisci, west of the Arverni, and north of the Nitiobroges and Cadurci., Map 14: Caesarodunum-Burdigala.

During the Roman period, their chief town was Vesunna, corresponding to the modern town of Périgueux. 

 History 
In 52 BC, they supplied around 5,000 warriors to Vercingetorix, to aid him to fight the Roman legions of Julius Caesar. Strabo mentions their excellence working with iron.",2025-03-26,['Historical Celtic peoples' 'Gauls'],"['Gallic' 'Périgord' 'Dordogne' 'Vézère' 'Iron Age' 'Roman period'

60,16205,5298137,7067,Non-metallic inclusions,"Non-metallic inclusions are chemical compounds and nonmetals that are present in steel and other alloys. They are the product of chemical reactions, physical effects, and contamination that occurs during the melting and pouring process. These inclusions are categorized by origin as either endogenous or exogenous. Endogenous inclusions, also known as indigenous, occur within the metal and are the result of chemical reactions. These products precipitate during cooling and are typically very small. Exogenous inclusions are caused by the entrapment of nonmetals. Their size varies greatly and their source can include slag, dross, flux residues, and pieces of the mold.

 Sources of inclusions formation 
Non-metallic inclusions arise because of many physical-chemical effects that occur in molten and consolidated metal during production.

Non-metallic inclusions that arise because of different reactions during metal production are called natural or indigenous. They include oxides, sulfides, nitrides and phosphides.

Apart from natural inclusions there are also parts of slag, refractories, material of a casting mould (the material the metal contacts during production) in the metal. Such non-metallic inclusions are called foreign, accidental or exogenous.

Most inclusions in the reduction smelting of metal formed because of admixture dissolubility decreasing during cooling and consolidation.

The present-day level of steel production technology allows the elimination of most natural and foreign inclusions from the metal. However its general content in different steels can vary between wide limits and has a big influence on the metal properties.

 Classification of non-metallic inclusions 
Non-metallic inclusions, the presence of which defines purity of steel, are classified by chemical and mineralogical content, by stability and by origin. By chemical content non-metallic inclusions are divided into the following groups:

sulfides (simple — FeS, MnS, Al2S3, CaS, MgS, Zr2S3 and others; compound — FeS·FeO, MnS·MnO and others);

nitrides (simple — ZrN, TiN, AlN, CeN and others; compound — Nb(C, N), V(c, N) and others), which can be found in alloyed steel and has strong nitride-generative elements in its content: titanium, aluminium, vanadium, cerium and others;
silicates

oxides (simple — FeO, MnO, Cr2O3, SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2 and others; compound — FeO·Fe2O3, FeO·Al2O3, FeO·Cr2O3, MgO·Al2O3, 2FeO·SiO2 and others;

The majority of inclusions in metals are oxides and sulfides since the content of phosphorus is very small. 
Silicates are very detrimental to steels, especially if it has to undergo heat treatment at a later stage.

Usually nitrides are present in special steels that contain an element with a high affinity to nitrogen.

By mineralogical content, oxygen inclusions divide into the following main groups:
 Free oxides — FeO, MnO, Cr2O3, SiO2 (quartz), Al2O3 (corundum) and others
 Spinels — compound oxides formed by bi and trivalent elements
Ferrites, chromites and aluminates are in this group.
silicates, which are present in steel like a glass formed with pure SiO2 or SiO2 with admixture of iron, manganese, chromium, aluminium and tungsten oxides and also crystalline silicates. Silicates are the biggest group among non-metallic inclusions. In liquid steel non-metallic inclusions are in solid or liquid condition. It depends on the melting temperature.

By stability, non-metallic inclusions are either stable or unstable. Unstable inclusions are those that dissolve in dilute acids (less than 10%concentration). Unstable inclusions are iron and manganese sulfides and also some free oxides.

Present-day levels of steel production allow to move off from the metal different inclusions. However, in general the content of inclusions in different steels varies within wide limits and has a big influence on the metal properties.

 Influence of non-metallic inclusions to the properties of steel and alloys 
Present-day methods of steel and alloy production are unable to attain completely pure metal without any non-metallic inclusions. Inclusions are present in any steel to a greater or lesser extent according to the mixture and conditions of production. Usually the amount of non-metallic inclusions in steel is not higher than 0.1%. However, the number of inclusions in metal is very high because of their extremely small size.

Non-metallic inclusions in steel are foreign substances. They disrupt the homogeneity of structure, so their influence on the mechanical and other properties can be considerable. During deformation, which occurs from flatting, forging, and stamping, non-metallic inclusions can cause cracks and fatigue failure in steel.

When investigating the influence of non-metallic inclusions on the quality of steel, of great importance are the properties of these inclusions: size, shape, chemical and physical characteristics. All these properties depend on the chemical composition of steel, method of smelting and for certain steel grade. These properties can change within wide limits even within the same mode of production.

Different methods for analysis of non-metallic inclusions have been developed and are now in use. These make it possible to determine content, structure and amount of non-metallic inclusions in steel and alloys with high accuracy.",2024-07-22,['Casting (manufacturing)' 'Metallurgy' 'Steelmaking'],"['nonmetals' 'steel' 'alloy' 'slag' 'dross' 'flux' 'mold' 'reactions'

62,11387,5282226,23169,Ys I: Ancient Ys Vanished," also known as Ys: The Vanished Omens, The Ancient Land of Ys or simply Ys (Japanese title: イース), is a 1987 action role-playing game developed by Nihon Falcom. It is the first installment in the Ys series. Initially developed for the PC-8800 series by Masaya Hashimoto (director, programmer, designer) and Tomoyoshi Miyazaki (scenario writer), the game was soon ported to the Sharp X1, PC-98, FM-7, and MSX2 Japanese computer systems.

Set in a land called Esteria, the story centers around the titular civilization called Ys, which had mysteriously vanished 700 years ago with only traces of its existence being kept within the game's six books. When it is prophesied that an impeding darkness would come to threaten Esteria, a young and adventurous warrior named Adol Christin is called forward to collect these six books to aid him in vanquishing the darkness. 

Ancient Ys Vanished saw many subsequent releases, such as an English-language version for the Master System and an enhanced remake for the TurboGrafx-CD system as part of a compilation called Ys I & II, alongside its 1988 sequel Ys II: Ancient Ys Vanished – The Final Chapter. It was also adapted into an OVA series Ys. DotEmu has released the game on Android with the following localizations: English, French, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Italian, German, and Portuguese. A Nintendo Switch port of the game, based on the original PC-8800 release, was released in February 2024, 37 years after the game's initial release.

Plot
Ys was a precursor to role-playing games that emphasize storytelling. The hero of Ys is an adventurous young swordsman named Adol Christin. As the story begins, he has just arrived at the Town of Minea, in the land of Esteria. He is called upon by Sara, a fortune-teller, who tells him of a great evil that is sweeping the land.

Adol is informed that he must seek out the six Books of Ys. These books contain the history of the ancient land of Ys, and will give him the knowledge he needs to defeat the evil forces. Sara gives Adol a crystal for identification and instructs him to find her aunt in Zepik Village, who holds the key to retrieving one of the Books. With that, his quest begins.

Gameplay
The player controls Adol on a game field viewed from a top-down perspective. As he travels on the main field and explores dungeons, Adol encounters numerous roaming enemies, which he must battle in order to progress.

Combat in Ys is rather different from other RPGs of the era, which either had turn-based battles or a manually activated sword. Ys instead features a battle system where fighters automatically attack when walking into their enemies off-center. When one fighter comes into contact with an enemy, damage can be sustained on both sides if both combatants are facing each other. Attacking straight-on causes the attacker the most damage to himself, but clipping the edge of the defender causes the attacked fighter to take most or all of the damage. If one fighter contacts the enemy's side or back, only the attacked fighter will sustain damage. This combat system was created with accessibility in mind. This ""bump attack"" system has become one of the series' defining features. (cf. ) Falcom staff have compared this style of gameplay to the enjoyment of popping air bubble sheets, in the sense that it took the tedious task of level-grinding and turned it into something similar to a high-score-based arcade video game. According to GamesTM and John Szczepaniak of Retro Gamer and The Escapist, ""repetition of the act was pleasurable as you developed a psychological rhythm and, even in the event of backtracking, progress was always swift since the player never needed to stop moving"". (cf. )

Another feature that has been used in nearly every Ys title since the original is the recharging health mechanism, which had previously been used in the Hydlide series. Recharging health has since become a common mechanism used in many video games today.

Ports
Aside from graphical differences, the game layout remains essentially the same across the many ports of Ys; there are some versions where the details were changed. The Master System version, for example, saw some of the game's dungeon areas flipped horizontally (including some other minor differences).

The most distinctive of the early ports was the Famicom edition, which was published by Victor Musical Industries. This version was a vast departure from the original, featuring entirely new layouts for the towns, field, and dungeons, replacement of a number of the original musical tracks, and a new final battle sequence.

The version developed for the MSX2 contained a handful of new musical tracks which replaced part of the original game's soundtrack. Some of these tracks, along with a number of unused tracks first composed for the original, were later incorporated into the soundtrack of Ys Eternal and Ys Complete.

The versions developed for the TurboGrafx-CD, released as Ys I & II in 1989, included additional cutscenes, such as an opening detailing Adol's arrival in the town of Minea. The Microsoft Windows-based remakes, Ys Eternal and Ys Complete, expand further on this and many other story elements, through both cutscenes and additional gameplay.

The 1991 remake for the X68000 uses pre-rendered 3D graphics for the boss sprites, which was called ""a bizarre contrast"" with the game's mostly 2D graphics. (cf. )

In 1997, a port was released for Sega Saturn, included in the release of ""Falcom Classics"" for Japanese systems only.

In 2024, a Nintendo Switch port based on the PC-8801 version was released by D4 Enterprise as part of their EGGCONSOLE series.

Music
Composed by Yuzo Koshiro along with Mieko Ishikawa, the soundtrack is notable for its rich melodies, in an age when video game music was beginning to progress from monotonous bleeps. The Ys soundtrack is considered to have some of the best video game music ever composed, and is considered one of the finest and most influential role-playing video game scores of all time.

Several soundtrack albums dedicated to the music of Ys have been released by Falcom. This includes:
 Music from Ys (1987): Contains the soundtrack to the original PC-8801 edition, along with a number of unused tracks and the replacement tracks used in the MSX edition, many of which were later incorporated into the Ys Eternal soundtrack. Also included are five arranged tracks from Ryo Yonemitsu, who arranged the soundtrack to the TurboGrafx-CD version of Ys I & II (1989).
 Perfect Collection Ys (1990): A two-disc release, the first disc of which is a new arrangement of the Ys soundtrack by Ryo Yonemitsu. The second disc contains assorted arrangements of tracks from both Ys I and II.
 Music from Ys Renewal (1995): The complete Ys soundtrack, including the bonus tracks, reproduced on upgraded synthesizer equipment.

Reception

The Master System version of Ys received positive reviews. It was reviewed in the March 1989 issue of Computer and Video Games magazine, stating that it has some of the best graphics on the system and that it ""offers depth and playability"" that ""will keep you engrossed for weeks"". The Games Machine compared the game to The Legend of Zelda, stating that ""in many respects, the character detail and all-round presentation make it the better game visually"", and concludes that Ys is ""one of the top-rank RPGs around"". ACE magazine in 1989 listed Ys as the second best Master System game available at the time, praising the ""huge scrolling"" world, characters who ""can be questioned"" and ""good deal of role-playing"" depth.

Scorpia of Computer Gaming World in 1993 reviewed the Apple IIGS and IBM PC versions of Ys. She stated that the game was ""a fairly simple entry with a few puzzles to solve"" along with ""Nintendo-style combat and graphics"" that was ""a romp"" and ""interesting mainly for seeing what the Japanese do in terms of lightweight CRPGs"".

Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu gave the Famicom (NES) version of the game a score of 30 out of 40. Famitsu also gave Ys I & II for the PC Engine CD-ROM (TurboGrafx-CD) a score of 35 out of 40.",2025-04-02,"['1987 video games' 'Action role-playing video games' 'DOS games'

While typically due to blockage of the LAD, other arteries of the heart may be involved. Risk factors are similar to other types of ischemic heart disease. The underlying mechanism is unclear; though may involve subendocardial ischemia or collateral circulation.

Diagnosis is based on an ECG showing ST-segment depression at the J-point of 1 to 3 mm in leads V1 to V6, with tall and symmetrical T waves. The ST-segment is upsloping and there is also often ST-segment elevation of 0.5 to 2 mm in lead aVR. The QRS complex is either normal or slightly wide.

Treatment is as per an ST elevation MI (STEMI), with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) being preferred. De Winter syndrome is uncommon, representing about 2 to 3% of people with anterior MIs. Males are more commonly affected than females.

It has a membership of 10,000 in three affiliated unions. Independent Christian Unions of Slovakia (NKOS) are an Open Union Confederation, based on Christian principles of democracy and humanism, registered at the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak republic on 26 May 1993 by law no. 83/1990 Zb. about Association of Citizens, as amended.
History of NKOS
In the years 1920 -1940 Christian unions were a significant factor in the state. They were called the Slovak Christian-social trade association. Their activity was forcibly closed in 1948. After the Velvet Revolution in 1989, an effort to restore their activity emerged. In 1990 the first Christian workers' clubs were created. Then came Christian Unions of Slovakia. Christian trade unionists efforts culminated on 26 March 1993 when NKOS were registered at the Ministry of Interior, their chairman was prof. Milan Katuninec. In 1994 the first NKOS trade union, railways, was created, with the chairman Joseph Micsinai and two years later the Trade Union of Workers in Education and Science of Slovakia came into existence with its first chairman Vladimir Cinderella. In 1995, a trade union KOVO METAL was founded, its first chairman was Dušan Mihalik. In December 1994, NKOS became a member of the International Labour Organisation. They became an observer of ITUC on the Compounding Congress in Vienna in 2006.

Social dialogue, Collective bargaining and Collective agreements
Sectoral collective agreements are concluded between NKOS and associations of employers by various sectors of the economy in which they adjust the framework institutes on working time, wage growth, holidays, creation of social fund, or other industrial institutes and so on.

NKOS collectively bargain and sign higher level collective agreements:
• Sectoral collective agreement in civil service.
• Sectoral collective agreement for employers, who proceed with remuneration ac-cording to the law no. 553 / 2003 Z.z. on remuneration of certain employees per-forming work in public interest.
• Sectoral collective agreement between the Trade Union KOVO, Independent Christian Trade Unions of Slovakia and The Association of Metallurgy, Mining Industry and Geology of the Slovak Republic.

The basis of strengthening social dialogue in the workplace is collective bargaining that results in an enterprise (organisational) collective agreement. Basic organisations of NKOS through the enterprise collective agreement improve labor, social and living conditions of the employee's at the specific workplace.

At the national level, together with the representative organisations working in the education and science, we signed the joint Declaration of the Trade Union of Workers in Education and Science of Slovakia and partner representations working in education to promote the improvement of the conditions and level of education and science in the Slovak Republic.

Slovak legislation gives majority unions monopoly power to negotiate and conclude collective agreements. This power has limited the ability of the NKOS to advance in the country.

69,674,5252221,4739,Magyar Cserkészlány Szövetség,"Girl Guides in Hungary are served by the Association of Hungarian Girl Guides (), with 512 members as of 2003. Founded in 1919, the girls-only organization became a full member of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts in 1928, and an associate member again in 1993. It regained full membership in 2008.

History
The first Guide group in Hungary was set up in 1919. The National Association of Hungarian Girl Guides was founded in 1921 and received as a member of the International Council, the forerunner of WAGGGS, in 1922. In 1928, the Hungarian Girl Guide association acted as hostess to the fifth International Conference of Guiding when the WAGGGS was founded. In 1939, the first Girl Guide and Girl Scout World Camp, Pax Ting, was held in Hungary, and attended by some 4000 Guides from around the world. During World War II the movement was involved in relief work in hospitals and helping refugees. With the siege of the capital, the association's activities were suspended. Guiding activities resumed after the war, but in 1948 the government banned all youth organizations, and the association was forced to cease functioning for the next 40 years. The first attempts to reorganize the movement started in 1988 as a response to political change in Hungary. In 1989, the Association of Hungarian Girl Guides was relaunched. A central committee concentrated on training potential leaders. In 1996 there were 20 troops, mostly working in schools.

73,7636,5272440,14530,Dave Marr,"David Francis Marr Jr. (December 27, 1933 – October 5, 1997) was an American professional golfer and sportscaster, best known for winning the 1965 PGA Championship.

Early years
Marr was born and raised in Houston, Texas, the son of a professional golfer. He attended St. Thomas High School, and while there was on the honor roll, captain of the golf team and member of the Letterman's Club. Following graduation, he attended Rice Institute and the University of Houston.

Professional career
In 1953 at age 19, Marr left college and turned professional. He began his professional golfing career by accepting a position at Westwood Country Club in Westwood, New Jersey, in 1953. A short time later, Marr took a job as an assistant club pro to Claude Harmon at Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, New York, where he began to blossom. He began playing regularly on the PGA tour in 1960, and in that year earned his first professional win at the Sam Snead Festival. A year later, he won the Greater Seattle Open Invitational and then the Azalea Open in 1962. Marr joined the elite in golf world in 1965 when he captured the coveted PGA Championship, was named to the Ryder Cup team and elected PGA Player of the Year.

The 1965 PGA Championship was played at the Laurel Valley Golf Club in Ligonier, Pennsylvania. He defeated golf legends Jack Nicklaus and Billy Casper by two strokes with a four-day total score of 280. Incredibly, this wasn't the biggest news story of the day in the Marr family – a few hours after his victory, his third child, son Tony, was born.

Marr played in the 1965 Ryder Cup, finishing his six matches with a 4-2 record. He was the appointed non-playing captain of the U.S. Ryder Cup team in 1981.

Marr was a close friend of Arnold Palmer. Marr and Palmer were both sons of PGA pros and developed a close bond. Palmer called Marr's 1965 PGA victory ""one of the happiest moments of my life,"" won at Palmer's home course. The two of them used to joke that between them they won a career grand slam. (Palmer won seven majors in his career, but never the PGA Championship, where he was a runner-up three times.)

Later years
Marr served as a golf analyst for ABC from 1972 until 1991, and was usually teamed with host Jim McKay and fellow one-time PGA Championship winner, Bob Rosburg. He later worked for the BBC in Britain and NBC in the U.S.

Marr and long-time golfing partner Jay Riviere established a golf course architectural and design firm in 1981, and designed many Texas courses and one each in Louisiana and Arizona.

After a battle with stomach cancer, Marr died at age 63 at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston on October 5, 1997. He was survived by his wife, Tally, and sons Dave III, Anthony, Wayne Bunch, Tucker Bunch, and daughter Elizabeth Hallas. Marr's oldest son, Dave III, worked for Golf Channel covering the Champions Tour.

Marr's children scattered his ashes around the various courses that meant so much to him during his playing days – Royal Birkdale, in England, where he played on the 1965 Ryder Cup team; Walton Heath, also in England, where he captained the 1981 Ryder Cup team; at the 18th hole at Laurel Valley, the site of his 1965 PGA Championship, along with Memorial Park Golf Course in Houston.

Awards and honors
Marr was elected to the National Collegiate Hall of Fame in 1977 and the Texas Golf Hall of Fame in 1978. He was selected for the Gold Tee Award presented by the Met (N.Y.) Golf Writers in 1990.

Golf executive Bryan Naugle created the Dave Marr Award the year after his death. It is awarded annually in conjunction with the Insperity Invitational. From 1995 through 1997 Marr was a member of the NBC Sports Golf broadcast team covering the US Open, US Amateur and Ryder Cup. Past winners of the Dave Marr Award include Gene Sarazen, Byron Nelson, Jack Nicklaus, Judy Rankin, Gary Player, Former President George H. W. Bush and Arnold Palmer.

75,20287,5306024,28136,"Prnjavor, Bosnia and Herzegovina","Prnjavor (, ) is a city and municipality in Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina. According to the 2013 census, the town has a population of 8,120 inhabitants, with 35,956 inhabitants in the municipality.

 Geography 

 Physical geography 
The municipality is located in the basin of the Ukrina river and is characterized by a mostly lowland hilly terrain configuration with the highest peak of 594m (mountain Ljubić). The Municipality of Prnjavor is shielded on all sides by low mountains such as Ljubić (south) and Motajica (north). The town of Prnjavor is located at an altitude of 185m. Other than the river Ukrina which forms in the Municipality of Prnjavor by merging of the Big and Small Ukrina near the village of Kulaši, there are also the rivers of Vijaka and Lišnja and various other streams. On the river Vijaka in the foothills of Ljubić there is a man made lake Drenova and further downstream there are Ribnjak fishing grounds.

 Political geography 
The municipality is located in the northern part of Republika Srpska and borders the municipalities of Derventa, Stanari, Teslić, Čelinac, Laktaši and Srbac. It has an area of 629.99 km2 and makes up 2,568% of the total territory of the Republika Srpska.

 Climate 
The area of the municipality belongs to the zone of temperate continental climate with moderately cold winters (average temperature in January 1 °C) and moderately warm summers (average temperature in July 31 °C). The average number of total hours of sunshine in the municipality of Prnjavor is 1,600 hours. The average annual rainfall is about 950 mm, and is evenly distributed throughout the year.

History

 Middle Ages 
Even over 700 years ago people recognized the economic potential of the area of the present-day Municipality of Prnjavor. Although there had been some settlements from the Roman period here, significant colonization and settlement (including the construction of monasteries, such as the one of at Stuplje) took place only in the Middle Ages. According to historical sources, medieval monasteries had their landed properties called Prnjavori, and the locals living there were called Prnjavorci. This is believed to be the origin of the name Prnjavor.

 Ottoman era 
During the Ottoman period the region suffered from border conflicts with the Austrian Empire. A significant number of Bosnians converted to Islam after the conquest by the Ottoman Empire in the second half of the 15th century, giving it a unique character within the Balkan region. This conversion appears to have been not sudden but a gradual process based on various rules imposed by the Ottomans — it took more than a hundred years for the number of Muslims to become the majority religion. The general view among scholars is that the Islamization of the Bosnian population was not the result of violent methods of conversions but was, for the most part, peaceful and voluntary.

The first time Prnjavor was mentioned in recorded history was in 1829. The current settlement itself is believed to be of a more recent date. In the mid-19th century and according to the records of the travel writer Jukić, Prnjavor had about a hundred houses and around a thousand inhabitants.

 Austria-Hungary 
In 1878 Austria-Hungary occupied Bosnia and the authorities decided the Prnjavor area was under-populated. Efforts were undertaken to attract settlers from other parts of the empire and consequently the municipal area was settled by Italians, Ukrainians, Czechs, Poles, Hungarians and German-speaking folk from Austria, Germany, Bohemia, Hungary and Russia. Although over half the population remained Eastern Orthodox Serbs, the multi-ethnic character of the population led the municipality of Prnjavor to be nicknamed ""Little Europe"".

 Yugoslavia 
In 1918 Bosnia became part of Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and all immigration stopped. During the interwar period between 1918 and 1941 Prnjavor underwent more significant economic development through the opening of craftsman workshops, hotels, more shops and a few manufacturing plants. From 1929 to 1941 Prnjavor was part of the Vrbas Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

Following the collapse of internal security during World War II the Nazis decided to evacuate the Volksdeutsche (ethnic German) population from Bosnia and a treaty to this effect was signed with the Croatian Ustaše regime on 30 September 1942. After 1945 the Communist regime of Josip Broz Tito repopulated the Volksdeutsche villages with Serbs and destroyed or obscured all evidence of German history and heritage in the region.

During the Socialist period of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Prnjavor was not a highly developed municipality within Bosnia and Herzegovina.

After the war that erupted after the collapse of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY), Prnjavor became part of the North-Eastern entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republika Srpska, as per the Dayton Agreement. The warring that took place in the very proximity of Prnjavor e.g. in Derventa, changed the demography in Bosnia and Herzegovina, according to the ICRC, a total of 2,2 million people had to flee their homes from different parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many people never returned, changing the ethnic composition in all parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Population of settlements – Prnjavor municipality

Ethnic composition

In the end of the 19th century, during Austria-Hungary, then sparsely populated area of the Municipality of Prnjavor was colonized by settlers from Eastern and Central Europe (Ukraine, Italy (South Tirol), Hungary, Poland, Germany, Austria, Bohemia, Slovakia, etc.). At the time of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and due to numerous national minorities (about 20) Prnjavor was called ""Little Europe"". Except the Ukrainian, Italian and Czech national minorities the others were mainly small communities. But, even today, besides the constitutive nations of Serbs, Croats, and Bosniaks, a small number of Hungarians, Slovaks, Germans, Polish, Slovenes, Bulgarians, Romanians, Macedonians, Jews, and Russians live in Prnjavor.

According to the census of 1991 there were still 732 Italians in Bosnia and Herzegovina, thereof around 2/3 lived in municipality of Prnjavor, while at the end of the second world war most of the Italians had returned to Italy to today's Trento province. The Italians populated mainly the village of Štivor in Prnjavor, where in 1991 73.13% of the population spoke Italian as their mother tongue.

The village school ""Šibovska"" teaches in Italian language ""lingua d'insegnamento italiana"". In 1986, it had 91 pupils and eight teachers.

The Polish population that arrived during the Austro-Hungarian empire, mostly left after the second world war in the population exchanges where German population left from the Western Poland to Germany after redrawing of borders, and Polish population from different parts of Europe, including Prnjavor, returned to the empty areas in Western Poland, mainly Boleslawiec.

Economy

The municipality of Prnjavor has the following land resources: farmlands (/68.8%), cultivable land (), forest resources () and water resources (Ukrina River, Drenova Lake).

Considering that almost four-fifths of the population live in rural areas and reckoning with great areas of cultivable land, with all reason agriculture has been recognized as the key branch of the economy considering the Municipality development. In the area of Prnjavor more than  of land are cultivated while  is planted with fruit crops.

Out of the total area of the cultivated farmlands, the cereal crops share is 77%, vegetable crops 10% while the rest has been sown with industrial crops, berries and fruit crops. New greenhouses are being constructed, health food production (organic agriculture) projects have been started to which the Municipality of Prnjavor has great predispositions due to the lack of significant industrial capacities as well as the preserved nature.

The following table gives a preview of total number of registered employed people per their core activity (as of 2016):

Tourism and leisure
Rivers and streams, the great areas of timber-lands as well as the Ukrina's banks covered with greenery and the old mills make this river specially attractive for all the nature and fishing lovers. The Drenova lake and fishing ground Ribnjak both have a very good foundation for hunting and fishing development. In 2003 a record catch (a 91 kg heavy catfish) was registered at this lake, otherwise being a fishing ground.

Hunting grounds, the hunting grounds on Mt. Motajica, in the forest lands of Čavka and Mt. Ljubić as well as the fishing ground of Ribnjak have again become destinations for hunters from Germany, Austria and especially Italy.

The operation began on July 17, 2023, and it completed in August 2023.  Results were announced on August 9, 2023.

Method
HSI teams utilized existing child sexual abuse material (CSAM) as a basis for analysis to comb through and search for unidentified children, offenders, and locations.  This information was packaged up to create leads that were then sent to investigative partners.  The precise technology or techniques used have not been revealed to the public.  However, the leads were shared with HSI field offices and 25 partnering countries in the US and abroad.

The process used facial recognition technology from the US-based company Clearview AI among other techniques to identify victims.  That AI technology has been banned by some countries including Australia because it breaches their privacy regulations.

Results
The operation allegedly generated: 
311 probable identifications of previously unknown victims
14 positive contacts (which includes several confirmed victim rescues from active abuse)

83,50809,368703,9885,Prefecture-level city,"A prefecture-level city () or prefectural city is an administrative division of the People's Republic of China (PRC), ranking below a province and above a county in China's administrative structure. 

During the Republican era, many of China's prefectural cities were designated as counties as the country's second level division below a province. From 1949 to 1983, the official term was a province-administrated city (Chinese: 省辖市). Prefectural level cities form the second level of the administrative structure (alongside prefectures, leagues and autonomous prefectures). Administrative chiefs (mayors) of prefectural level cities generally have the same rank as a division chief () of a national ministry. Since the 1980s, most former prefectures have been renamed into prefecture-level cities.

A prefectural level city is a ""city"" () and ""prefecture"" () that have been merged into one consolidated and unified jurisdiction. As such it is simultaneously a city, which is a municipal entry with subordinate districts, and a prefecture with subordinate county-level cities and counties which is an administrative division of a province.

A prefectural level city is often not a ""city"" in the usual sense of the term (i.e., a large continuous urban settlement), but instead an administrative unit comprising, typically, a main central urban area (the core city, city as in the usual sense, usually with the same name as the prefectural level city) surrounded by rural areas, which together are divided into districts, and some surrounding counties or county-level cities governed by the prefecture-level city on behalf of the province, which all have their own urban areas surrounded by their own rural areas. The urban areas of the surrounding counties are usually smaller than the core urban area, and towns also form small urban areas scattered in the rural. The larger prefectural level cities span over .

Prefectural level cities nearly always contain multiple counties, county level cities, and other such sub-divisions. This results from the fact that the formerly predominant prefectures, which prefectural level cities have mostly replaced, were themselves large administrative units containing cities, smaller towns, and rural areas. To distinguish a prefectural level city from its actual urban area (city in the strict sense), the term shìqū (市区; ""urban area""), is used.

The first prefectural level cities were created on 5 November 1983. Over the following two decades, prefectural level cities have come to replace the vast majority of Chinese prefectures; the process is still ongoing.

Most provinces are composed entirely or nearly entirely of prefectural level cities. Of the 22 provinces and five autonomous regions of the PRC, only nine provinces (Yunnan, Guizhou, Qinghai, Heilongjiang, Sichuan, Gansu, Jilin, Hubei, and Hunan) and three autonomous regions (Xinjiang, Tibet, and Inner Mongolia) have at least one or more second level or prefectural level divisions that are not prefectural level cities. In the case of the disputed Taiwan, it has six prefectural level cities, but these are governed separately by the Republic of China as their special municipalities.

Criteria that a prefecture must meet to become a prefectural level city:

 An urban centre with a non-rural population over 250,000
 gross output of value of industry of 200,000,000 RMB (US$32 million)
 the output of the tertiary sector supersedes that of the primary sector, contributing over 35% of the GDP

Fifteen large prefectural level cities have been granted the status of sub-provincial city, which gives them much greater autonomy.

Shijiazhuang, Suzhou, and Zhengzhou are the largest prefectural level cities with populations approaching or exceeding some sub-provincial cities.

A sub-prefecture-level city is a county-level city with powers approaching those of prefectural level cities.

Classification
There are a total of three classifications of prefecture-level cities:

Regular prefectural level city, which consists of counties, county level cities, and districts subdivisions.
Consolidated district-governed prefectural level city, which only consists of districts as subdivisions.
 Currently there are only 13 cities under this classification: Ezhou, Foshan, Guangzhou, Haikou, Karamay, Nanjing, Sansha, Sanya, Shenzhen, Wuhai, Wuhan, Xiamen, and Zhuhai
Prefectural level city with no county-level divisions (direct-piped city), which are cities that do not govern any county-level divisions such as counties, county level cities, or legal administrative districts.
 Currently there are only four cities under this classification: Danzhou, Dongguan, Jiayuguan, and Zhongshan

 Cartographic expression and statistics 

In Europe and North America, cities are generally represented as points, while counties are represented as areas. Thus, Bloomington, Indiana, is indicated on the map by a point, which is distinct from, and enclosed by, the area of Monroe County, Indiana. In China, however, large cities such as Xianning may, in reality, contain both urban and rural elements. Moreover, they may enclose counties or other cities. On a less detailed map, Xianning would be indicated by a point, more or less corresponding to the coordinates of its city government. Other populous areas may also be exhibited as points, such as the county of Tongshan, with no indication that Tongshan is, in fact, enclosed by Xianning. On a more detailed map, Xianning would be drawn as an area, similar to a county of the United States, and Tongshan would be drawn as a smaller area within Xianning.

This convention may lead to difficulty in the identification of places mentioned in older sources. For example, Guo Moruo writes that he was born in the town of Shawan, within the prefecture of Leshan, and attended primary school in the town of Jiading. A modern map is unlikely to show either town: Shawan, because it is too small, and Jiading, because it is the seat of Leshan, and is therefore indicated on the map by a point labelled ""Leshan."" A more detailed map would show Shawan as a district within Leshan, but Jiading would still be missing.

Statistics of China such as population and industrial activity are generally reported along prefectural city lines. Thus, the relatively unknown city of Huangshi has 2.5 million residents, more than most European capitals, but upon closer inspection, the city covers an area almost 100 kilometers across. Furthermore, Huangshi contains several other cities, such as Daye. If a person wished to calculate the population of the urban area of Huangshi, and had a map of Huangshi, and a table of its population by district, the task might not be easy. The urban area might be split between several districts, and some of those districts may include rural elements as well.",2025-03-03,"[""Prefecture-level divisions of the People's Republic of China""

84,31990,75886048,2948,Pareas atayal,"Pareas atayal, also known as the Atayal slug-eating snake, is a small, harmless snake endemic to Taiwan.

 Description 
Pareas atayal is a slender, yellow-brown snake which may reach about  in length. Its dorsum is primarily yellow-brown or ochre with slightly lighter flanks and a yellow-white or crème belly and chin. Clear, darkly-colored vertical bars mark the sides of this snake, each being roughly two scales wide.

Very small brownish dots dust the flanks and dorsum of the snake, where the flanks possess less than the dorsum and the ventral surface possesses less than the flanks. Two very thin, but well-defined black stripes stem from the lower and upper edges of each postorbital scale.

The lower postorbital stripe reaches the anterior part of the seventh supralabial scale, but does not continue to the lower jaw or chin. The upper postorbital stripes meet at the base of the head, forming an M-shaped arch.

 Behaviour 
Like others of its genus, P. atayal is a nocturnal, invertebrate-eating snake with a preference for land snails and slugs.

 Etymology 
Pareas atayal is named after the native Taiwan aboriginal people, the Atayal, as they inhabit the same mountainous regions of northern Taiwan.",2024-02-17,"['Pareas' 'Snakes of Asia' 'Reptiles of Taiwan' 'Endemic fauna of Taiwan'

85,1203,75004458,6206,José Fabio Melgar Valdivieso,"José Fabio Melgar Valdivieso (February 26, 1802 – 1884) was a Peruvian lawyer, diplomat and politician. He was  Minister of Foreign Affairs four times Minister of Finance and Commerce three times and Minister of Justice once, Instruction and Charity (1859-1860), & Worship and Public Works (1860).

 Biography 
He was the son of Juan de Dios Melgar Sanabria and Andrea Valdivieso, and brother of the famous poet Mariano Melgar, hero of the War of Independence who was shot in 1815 by the royalists. He studied in his hometown and then went to Lima, where he graduated as a lawyer in 1834.

He entered the public administration service, as a second officer of the Ministry of Finance, rising to senior officer. He stood out for his honesty and efficiency. He eventually served in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a senior officer, temporarily taking charge of said office for a few days in August 1844, due to the lack of a head.

During the first government of Ramón Castilla he accidentally assumed the Treasury portfolio(unsure what this is) from August to December 1846, and then took charge of it for a longer period, from July 1849 to April 1851.

During the government of General José Rufino Echenique, he was proposed by General Manuel de Mendiburu to be Minister of Finance, but this was opposed by General Juan Crisóstomo Torrico, who was not interested in such a designation because he was interested in profit. with the benefits of internal debt consolidation.

In the second government of Ramón Castilla he again took over as Minister of Finance (1855-1856); and then as Minister of Foreign Affairs (1857-1858 and 1859). He was simultaneously in charge of the Ministry of War and Navy when its head, General Miguel de San Román, had to leave the capital to fight the revolution in Arequipa. And when the Council of Ministers was organized in obedience to the provisions of the Constitution of 1856, he assumed the portfolio of Justice, Instruction and Charity (1859-1860), and briefly, & Worship and Public Works (1860). At some point he also assumed the vice presidency of the Council of Ministers.

He then returned to head the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, from June 1860 to November 1861, replacing his nephew Miguel del Carpio y Melgar. At the head of the Peruvian Foreign Ministry, he defended the interests of Peru before Ecuador and Bolivia; and he addressed two circulars to the governments of America (November 14 and 20, 1861), vigorously protesting against the interference of the European powers in the Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Mexico.

At the end of the government of Castile, he was again appointed Minister of Finance, a position he held from May to June 1862.

Among the various public positions that he subsequently held, is that of president of the High Court of Accounts, and that of member of the Advisory Commission of Administration in the Ministry of Government (1873).

Retired from public life, he dedicated himself to recreating the legend of his brother, the poet Mariano Melgar, collecting traditions and memories, with which he drew up a biography, which Francisco García Calderón Landa incorporated in the first compilation of the poems of the famous Arequipa poet. (1878), which was later reproduced by Manuel Rafael Valdivia in the Lira Arequipeña (1889).

The exact date of his death is unknown, but is assumed to have been sometime after the Pacific War.",2025-03-02,"['Foreign ministers of Peru' 'Ministers of economy and finance of Peru'

Location
The location of Falacrine has been the subject of debate. The village is described as lying just beyond Reate (modern Rieti), in the Sabine hill country northeast of Rome. According to local tradition before the 16th century, it was between Greccio and Contigliano. However, local historian Mariano Vittori believed that Falacrine lay near Cittareale, in the province of Rieti. Latini found ruins in Collicelle, a  frazione of Cittareale that he thought were Falacrine. However, in Amatrice it's believed that Falacrine lies in the frazione of Torrita, above the valley of the same name. Others have suggested that it lies in Antrodoco, Rieti or Paganico Sabino.

 Background 
The Dogras under the suizerenity of the Sikh Empire had invaded Tibet in the Dogra–Tibetan war, however lost their general, Zorawar Singh in a battle. Encouraged by the victory, the Tibetans went on to invade Ladakh. The leader of the Dogra dynasty, Gulab Singh immediately sent relief forces and reinforcements, which included Sikh, Dogra and Kashmiri troops.

 Battle 
The Battle took place on 6 September 1842. The Tibetans invaded Ladakh under the command of General Ragasha. The Tibetans decided upon a night attack, however were found out and could not do any major damage, instead they were pushed back. The Tibetans took shelter in a fortification, which was later attacked by the Dogras but had to withdraw. After four days, there was no clear victor. The Dogras decided to flood the Tibetan camp which was situated in a low level valley, after three days, the Tibetan camps were successfully flooded and had to be abandoned. When the Tibetans fled, the Dogras led several attacks and Wazir Mustaddi were sent to negotiate a truce, the Tibetan men came to the Dogra camped but were made prisoners. Among the seized, Tibetan General Ragasha was killed as an act of vengeance for Zorawar Singh. Another battle took place where the Dogras repulsed the Tibetans, many of the Tibetans being killed.

 Aftermath 
Upon hearing of this struggle, Raja Gulab Singh had sent 4,000 reinforcements, however, upon hearing of the victory at Ladakh, they had halted their march.

88,56397,76600973,31144,Renaissance in Urbino,"The Renaissance in Urbino was one of the most fundamental manifestations of the early Italian Renaissance.

During the lordship of Federico da Montefeltro, from 1444 to 1482, a fertile and vital artistic climate developed at the court, due to cultural exchanges with numerous centers on the peninsula and also abroad, especially the Flemish one. The cultural movement in Urbino was restricted within the court, around its highly refined prince, and although it elaborated highly advanced and avant-garde solutions, it did not generate a real local school, also due to the recourse mainly to foreign artists. Nevertheless, the Urbino style, by virtue of the very circulation of artists, experienced a wide diffusion, which made it one of the key variations of the Italian Renaissance. Among the basic characteristics of its humanistic culture were the unmistakable tone made of measure and rigor, which had protagonists such as Piero della Francesca, Luciano Laurana, Justus van Gent, Pedro Berruguete, Francesco di Giorgio Martini, and Fra Diamante.

According to French historian André Chastel, the Urbino Renaissance, called ""mathematical,"" was one of the three fundamental components of the early Renaissance, along with the Florentine, ""philological and philosophical,"" and the Paduan, ""epigraphical and archaeological."" Of the three it was the one ""most closely related to the arts.""

As the 16th century approached, the city, while remaining an island of highly refined culture, saw an impoverishment of its vitality in the figurative arts. Despite this, one of the great geniuses of the mature Renaissance, Raphael Sanzio, was born and took his very first steps in Urbino. From a cultural and literary point of view, on the other hand, Urbino remained for a long time one of the most stimulating environments in Italy, as witnessed by Baldassarre Castiglione, who set his Cortegiano at the court of Guidobaldo and Elisabetta da Montefeltro.

 Historical and cultural context 

Federico da Montefeltro, a successful condottiero, highly skilled diplomat and enthusiastic patron of the arts and literature, was responsible for the transformation of the Duchy of Urbino from the capital of an economically depressed territory to one of the most fertile and refined artistic centers of the time.

In 1444 Federico took power after the death of his brother Oddantonio in a conspiracy.

At the time he was one of the most sought-after captains of fortune, but he had also received a rare humanistic education in Mantua, under Vittorino da Feltre. From the master he absorbed an interest in mathematics, which shaped much of his cultural interests and artistic commissions, and reflexively his interest in architecture, which he believed was based on arithmetic and geometry. This gave rise to André Chastel's interpretation of Urbino as the court of mathematical Humanism, which had in Piero della Francesca its greatest interpreter and to whose influence can be referred the work of Bartolomeo della Gatta, the only one in Urbino who seemed to understand Piero.

Federico set his hand to the pressing political problems and began a reorganization of the state, which included a reorganization of the city according to a modern, comfortable, rational, and beautiful style. All his efforts, in the nearly forty years of his rule, were directed toward this goal, which, due to his extraordinary talents combined with considerable good fortune, came within a whisker of full realization. The point of reference in this ambitious cultural project was immediately Florence and its innovations related to humanism and the Renaissance. With the Tuscan city, as early as 1444, an alliance and an atmosphere of mutual protection was established, which facilitated the exchange of artists and personalities.

Federico called Leon Battista Alberti, Paolo Uccello, Luciano Laurana, Francesco di Giorgio Martini, who wrote the Treatise on Architecture for him, and the mathematician Luca Pacioli to his court. He was also very interested in Flemish painting, beginning in the 70s, so much so that the duke called artists such as Pedro Berruguete and Justus van Gent to work with him, who developed a happy dialogue between the Nordic ""realist"" figurative tradition and the Italian ""synthetic"" one. Giovanni Santi, father of Raphael, wrote a poetic account of the leading artists of the period.

At the palace they discussed the form the ""ideal city"" should take, its perspective, and the historical and moral legacy of ""illustrious men.""

The Duke's library was famous, organized by the humanist Vespasiano da Bisticci, and was full of codices with valuable illuminated pages.

Federico, through Baldassarre Castiglione's descriptions in Il Cortegiano, introduced the characters of the so-called ""gentleman"" in Europe, which remained fully in vogue until the 20th century.

 Architecture, urban planning and sculpture 
The first Renaissance endeavor in Urbino was the portal of the church of San Domenico, created in 1449 in a manner similar to a Roman triumphal arch by Maso di Bartolomeo, called to the city through the intercession of Fra Carnevale, an Urbino painter sent perhaps by Federico himself to the workshop of Filippo Lippi, one of the three most famous Florentine painters of the time (along with Beato Angelico and Domenico Veneziano). Maso was a Florentine architect, sculptor, and goldsmith who had already trained in the workshop of Donatello and Michelozzo, with whom he had worked on the Cathedral of Prato.

 Ducal Palace and the city 

Federico da Montefeltro's most ambitious project was the construction of the Ducal Palace and, at the same time, the urban planning of Urbino, making it the city ""of the prince.""

Before Federico's interventions, Urbino was a town perched on two contiguous hills, with an elongated and irregular shape surrounded by a ring of walls. The main road axis cut through the city along the lower part between the two hills, leading on one side to the sea and on the other to the Apennine passes to Perugia and Lazio. The ducal residence was a simple palace on the southern hill, to which was added a nearby castellany, on the edge of the cliff towards the Porta Valbona.

 The first phase: Maso di Bartolomeo 

In about 1445 Federico first had the two ancient ducal buildings joined, calling in Florentine architects (headed by Maso di Bartolomeo) to build an intermediate palace. The result was the three-story Palazzetto della Jole, in a simple and typically Tuscan austere style. The interior was decorated with some sober antiquarian accents in the furnishings, as in the friezes and fireplaces, centered on the celebration of Hercules and the virtues of war.

 The second phase: Luciano Laurana 
In the 60s the design of the palace was changed, to make it also an administrative headquarters and a place to host illustrious figures. From about 1466 the work in fact passed to a new architect, Dalmatian Luciano Laurana. The centerpiece of the new arrangement was the vast porticoed courtyard, which connected the previous buildings. The courtyard has harmonious, classical forms, with a portico with round arches, oculi, and Corinthian columns on the ground floor, while the main floor is punctuated by lesenes and architraved windows. Along the first two string courses run inscriptions in Roman capital letters, which are of classical epigraphic character, as are the capitals, precisely copied from Flavian specimens.

From this core the palace was later expanded toward the city and in the opposite direction. The facade toward the city had an ""open book"" (L-shaped) form on Piazzale Duca Federico, which was specially arranged by Francesco di Giorgio Martini and later closed on the north side by the side of the cathedral. The palace thus became the centerpiece of the urban fabric without being disruptive and subduing, with its presence, even the nearby religious authority.

The front overlooking Valbona was, on the other hand, completed with the so-called ""facade of the Torricini,"" slightly rotated westward with respect to the orthogonal axes of the palace. It owes its name to the two towers flanking the tall and narrow facade, yet softened in the center by the ascending rhythm of three superimposed loggias, each repeating the pattern of the triumphal arch. The façade of the Torricini does not look toward the built-up area but outward, so greater stylistic freedom was possible, without having to worry about integration with earlier buildings; moreover, its imposing presence is clearly visible even from afar, as a symbol of ducal prestige. 

 The third phase: Francesco di Giorgio 
In 1472 Francesco di Giorgio Martini took over the direction of the work, completing the L-shaped facade, taking care of the private spaces, the loggias, the hanging garden and the second floor of the courtyard, as well as the connection with the underlying structures outside the walls. At the foot of the cliff was a large clearing, known as the ""Mercatale"" because it was the site of a market, where Francesco di Giorgio created the helicoidal ramp, which allowed wagons and horses to reach the palace and the ""Data,"" that is, the large stables located at mid-height.

In the interior spaces overseen by Francesco di Giorgio, a change in style can be seen, marked by a more sumptuous and abstract decoration. In spite of these differences, the palace succeeded in the almost miraculous attempt to combine the various parts with balance in an asymmetrical complex, conditioned by the irregularities of the terrain and the pre-existing buildings, in which the rigor of the individual parts balances the lack of a unified design.

San Bernardino
Outside the palace, it was Francesco di Giorgio Martini who investigated some of the problems derived from the considerations of the court. One example is the church of San Bernardino, erected between about 1482 and 1491 by testamentary disposition of the duke, who intended to be buried there. The architect used a Latin-cross plan with a single, barrel-vaulted nave that grafts onto the rectangular-based presbytery (slightly flatter on the transept side, otherwise resembling a square altogether), where three semicircular apses originally opened (the one behind the high altar was later torn down and replaced by a rectangular barrel-vaulted niche). The effect was that of the tripartite cell, of late antique inspiration, realized, however, with a spatial sharpness typical of Urbino culture. The exterior is almost bare, with brick facing enlivened only by the string-course cornices, windows and portal. The interior, on the other hand, is characterized by the almost bare masonry backgrounds, articulated by the solids and voids of the volumes and with a few details of refined preciousness, such as the gray moldings on the structural joints (of Brunelleschian inspiration), or the columns on high plinths that support the dome and make its weight discharge to the ground visible. The inscription in Roman capital letters runs around the entire perimeter and closely resembles that of the courtyard of honor in the Ducal Palace.

 Military fortresses 

While in Urbino Francesco di Giorgio Martini also wrote the Treatise on Architecture, Engineering and Military Art, in which the various architectural types were considered with extensive use of illustrations created by the artist himself. The study of monuments and basic texts of ancient architecture was being actualized with a more elastic attitude, open to concrete solutions to problems and experimentalism. In practice this attitude was seen in the creation of numerous military fortresses commissioned by Federico for the defense of the Duchy. Although many of those buildings have been destroyed or heavily modified, San Leo, Mondavio and Sassocorvaro remain virtually intact, bearing witness to how offensive and defensive functions are specifically integrated with the orography of the sites, through often ingenious empirical intuitions that set aside the complex geometric or zoomorphic plans depicted in the Treatise. Fortresses are often composed as loose aggregations of elemental solids (such as cylindrical towers), ideal for passive projectile defense. Few and subtly refined are the formal decorations, such as the string-course cornices that elastically wrap around the perimeters or the infilled corbels that support the walkways and enliven the smooth curtain walls.  

 Painting and marquetry 
The local school of painting was initially dominated by Fra Carnevale, a pupil of Filippo Lippi, and various passing masters, including Paolo Uccello, who lived in Urbino between 1467 and 1468 to paint the Communion of the Apostles. According to Vasari, however, Piero della Francesca was also present in the city from the time of Guidantonio da Montefeltro, whose first documentary traces in the city date back to 1469.

Piero della Francesca

Piero della Francesca is rightly considered one of the protagonists and promoters of Urbino culture, although he was neither a native of the Marche region by birth or training, but rather a Tuscan. Nevertheless, it was precisely in Urbino that his style achieved an unsurpassed balance between the use of strict geometric rules and the serenely monumental scope of his paintings. His relationship with Federico da Montefeltro's court is not fully elucidated, especially with regard to the frequency and duration of his sojourns, in the context of a life full of poorly documented movements. At least one sojourn in Urbino between 1469 and 1472 is considered plausible, where he brought his style already delineated in its fundamental traits from his earliest artistic efforts and summarized in the perspective organization of the paintings, the geometric simplification that invests the compositions and even individual figures, the balance between ceremonial stillness and investigation of human truth, and the use of a very clear light that lightens the shadows and permeates the colors.

One of the earliest works linked to the Urbino patronage is the Flagellation, an emblematic work with multiple levels of interpretation that continues to fascinate researches and studies. The panel is divided into two sections proportioned by the golden ratio: on the right, in the open, are three figures in the foreground, while on the left, under a loggia, the scene of the actual flagellation of Christ unfolds more in the distance. The very precise perspective framing coordinates the two groups, seemingly unrelated to each other, while the hues match and enhance each other in the clear light, which comes from different sources. The arcane stillness of the characters is heightened by unusual elements of iconography, in which theological issues and facts of current events are mixed.

In the double Portrait of the Dukes of Urbino (c. 1465) one can already see an influence of Flemish painting, in the blurred landscapes in extremely distant depths and the attention to detail in the immediately nearby effigies of the dukes. The study of light is notable (cold and lunar for Battista Sforza, warm for Federico), unified by a strong formal rigor, a full sense of volume, and certain contrivances, such as the red frame that is redder than Federico's clothes, that isolate the portraits by making them loom over the viewer.

In the Madonna of Senigallia (c. 1470), set in a compartment of the Ducal Palace, Piero admirably fuses a clear and simplified composition with the use of light in a poetic manner. Here, too, one catches references to the Flemish, such as the small room in the background where a window opens and a ray of sunlight filters through, lighting reflections in the hair of the angel in front.

However, the research into the harmony between spatial rigor and luminous truth had its best outcome in the Brera Altarpiece (1472), formerly in San Bernardino, where Federico da Montefeltro is portrayed kneeling as the patron. Figures and architectural setting are closely linked, and in fact the figures are arranged in a semicircle occupying the space of the apse in which the scene is set. The pigments used are not many, but the use of different binders allows for different effects while maintaining tuned hues. The space is deep and light is its abstract and motionless protagonist, defining forms and materials in the most diverse effects: from the dark opacity of the saints' humble cloths to the reflections of Federico's shiny armor. 

 The Study and the Library 

The Study of Federico da Montefeltro (1473–1476) is practically the only one of the interior rooms of the Ducal Palace that has largely preserved its original decoration. It features sumptuous ornamentation, with continuous cross-references between the royal architecture and the illusionistic architecture depicted in the famous wooden inlays (the work of Baccio Pontelli, Giuliano da Maiano and other artists for the designs) and paintings once preserved there.  

Originally the upper part was decorated by a frieze with twenty-eight portraits of illustrious men of the past and present, arranged on two registers, the work of Justus van Gent and Pedro Berruguete, and today divided between the Louvre Museum and the National Gallery of the Marches (which keeps them in another room).

The portraits, which included both civic and ecclesiastical, Christian and pagan figures, were intensified by a slightly lowered point of view and the unified background, which through perspective created the effect of a royal gallery.

The dazzling colors and continuous cross-references between real and fantastic architecture were meant to create in the viewer an effect of great wonder. The tarsias are attributed to various authors, such as Giuliano da Maiano and, for the drawings, Botticelli, Francesco di Giorgio Martini, and the young Donato Bramante. The inlays of Baccio Pontelli, a specialist in complex perspective constructions of geometric objects, which created a continuous exchange between reality and fiction, dilating the space of the otherwise tiny room, stand out.

The objects portrayed alluded to the symbols of the Arts, but also to the Virtues (the mace of Fortitude, the sword of Justice, etc.), as if the exercise of the former paved the way for the Virtues themselves. A portrait of Federico personified and clarified the allegory of the whole, which exalted the Duke as the protagonist of the virtuous parable of the ethical and intellectual meanings of the decoration, which advocated the theme of pensive solitude, ethics and contemplation as the nourishment of action.

The natural offshoot of the Study was the Library of Federico da Montefeltro, now housed in the Vatican Library, where there was a series of paintings on the walls featuring the Liberal Arts, symbolized by female figures on thrones, which were composed strongly foreshortened from below, at the apex of steps in a space that continued ideally from one painting to the next. The Arts were portrayed in the act of handing over their insignia to Federico and other court figures, investing them as ideal vassals. 

 Legacy and influence 

The rarefied and extremely refined climate of Federico's court essentially involved the palace, and it was limited to it, not fostering the development of a true local school. At the duke's death artistic activities came to an undeniable halt, but with the return home of the foreign artists who had come to the court there was a very wide diffusion of the Urbino style, with fruitful developments. The most obvious examples concern the developments of the relationship between real and painted architecture, inaugurated by Piero della Francesca and the makers of the inlays of the Study, which was picked up by Melozzo da Forlì, who exported it to Rome, and by the nascent Perugia school, especially in the beginnings of Pietro Vannucci.

However, the climate born in the Montefeltro seignory remained a pillar in the local figurative culture, influencing the formation of two of the main interpreters of the full Renaissance, who originated precisely in Urbino: Raphael and Bramante.

 The 16th century 

With the extinction of the Montefeltros Urbino remained a brilliant Renaissance court, although no longer at the forefront of the avant-garde, thanks to the Della Rovere family. The court, endowed with great elegance and taste, was a patron of Titian, who painted, for example, the famous Venus of Urbino there. In the first decades of the sixteenth century, the production of the famous historiated ceramics reached its peak, with artists such as Francesco Xanto Avelli and Niccolò Pellipario, known as Nicola da Urbino, followed in the second half of the century by the flourishing workshops of the Fontana and Patanazzi families. During that period the city became a center at the forefront of Counter-Reformation painting production, thanks to Federico Barocci.",2024-06-22,"['Renaissance art' 'Italian Renaissance' 'Urbino' 'Montefeltro family'

90,5328,362355,88414,Craft beer,"Craft beer is beer manufactured by craft breweries, which typically produce smaller amounts of beer than larger ""macro"" breweries and are often independently owned. Such breweries are generally perceived and marketed as emphasising enthusiasm, new flavours, and varied brewing techniques.

The microbrewery movement began in both the United States and United Kingdom in the 1970s, although traditional artisanal brewing existed in Europe for centuries and subsequently spread to other countries. As the movement grew, and some breweries expanded their production and distribution, the more encompassing concept of craft brewing emerged. A brewpub is a pub that brews its own beer for sale on the premises.

 Producer definitions 
 Microbrewery 

Although the term ""microbrewery"" was originally used in relation to the size of breweries, it gradually came to reflect an alternative attitude and approach to brewing flexibility, adaptability, experimentation and customer service. The term and trend spread from the UK to the US in the 1980s, and was eventually used as a designation for breweries that produce fewer than  annually. In 1995, there were 205 microbreweries nationwide. In 2000, that number more than doubled to 420 microbreweries.

 Nanobrewery 

The website The Food Section defines a ""nanobrewery"" as, ""a scaled-down microbrewery, often run by a solo entrepreneur, that produces beer in small batches."" Nanobrewers often work out of garages or small industrial spaces. Small batches are then sold to local bars or directly to customers. The U.S. Department of the Treasury defines nanobreweries as ""very small brewery operations"" that produce beer for sale. These small operations still must meet state and federal licensing requirements. In 2013, there were more than 200 ""nanos"" in the United States. With lower startup costs than a craft brewery, nanobreweries have become popular among home brewers looking to expand and practice their beer brewing skills.

 Craft brewery 
""Craft brewing"" is a more encompassing term for developments in the industry succeeding the microbrewing movement of the late 20th century. The definition is not entirely consistent but typically applies to relatively small, independently owned commercial breweries that employ traditional brewing methods and emphasize flavor and quality. The term is usually reserved for breweries established since the 1970s but may be used for older breweries with a similar focus. A United States trade group, the Brewers Association, interested in brand transparency, offers a definition of craft breweries as ""small, independent and traditional"". The craft brewing process takes time and can be considered an art by the brewmasters. In the United Kingdom, the Assured Independent British Craft Brewer initiative is run by the Society of Independent Brewers (SIBA), who ensure that any breweries using the Independent Craft Brewer logo are relatively small, independent and brewing quality beer.

 Farm brewery 
The term ""farm brewery"" or ""farmhouse brewery"" has been around for centuries. Several beer styles are considered ""farmhouse,"" originally stemming from farmers brewing low ABV beer as an incentive for field workers. Farm breweries were not large scale; they had smaller, more unique, methods of brewing and fermenting in comparison to the larger breweries of the time. This had different effects on the overall product, creating unconventional beer flavors.

The term ""farm brewery"" has more recently found its way into several local and state laws in order to give farm breweries certain, often agriculturally related, privileges not normally found under standard brewery laws. These privileges usually come at a price: some portion of the ingredients (such as grains, hops, or fruit) used in the beer must be grown on the given licensed farm brewery.

 Brewpub 

Brewpub is an abbreviated term combining the ideas of a brewery and a pub or public-house. A brewpub can be a pub or restaurant that brews beer on the premises. In the United States a brewpub is defined as selling 25 percent or more of its beer on-site and operating significant food services. A taproom brewery is a professional brewery that sells 25 percent or more of its beer on-site and does not operate significant food services. The beer is brewed primarily for sale in the taproom, and is often dispensed directly from the brewery's storage tanks.

The term first gained prominence in California in the early 1980s. The concept was popularized by Buffalo Bill's Brewery in Hayward, which opened on September 9, 1983, as one of the first modern brewpubs in the United States. This followed the passage of Assembly Bill 3610 in 1982, authored by Assemblyman Tom Bates, which allowed brewers to sell directly to consumers if food was served.  Signed into law on January 1, 1983, the legislation paved the way for brewpubs in California. Although Buffalo Bill's founder Bill Owens attempted to trademark the term ""brewpub,"" it had already entered common usage. The legalization and rise of brewpubs helped spark California’s craft beer movement.

In the European Union, brewpubs in some countries are favoured by a system of progressive beer duty, which originated in Bavaria. In the United Kingdom brewpubs brewing up to 5,000 hectolitres a year (about 880,000 pints) pay just half of ordinary beer duty rates.

 Developments in the 21st century 

 Marketing strategy 
Craft beer has adopted a marketing strategy that differs from those of the large, mass-market breweries, offering products that compete on the basis of quality and diversity instead of low price and advertising. Their influence has been much greater than their market share, which amounts to only 2% in the UK, indicated by the introduction by large commercial breweries of new brands for the craft beer market. However, when the strategy failed, the corporate breweries invested in microbreweries or, in many cases, acquired them outright.

 Canned beer 

The American Can Company developed the first beer can in 1933 after years of researching how to create a can that would hold a pressurized carbonated beverage. They also created a special coating on the inside of a can to prevent a metallic taste from affecting the beer. The first can of beer was sold on January 24, 1935, when the American Can Company partnered with New Jersey–based Gottfried Krueger Brewing Company, delivering two thousand cans of Krueger's Finest Beer and Krueger's Cream Ale to people in Richmond, Virginia. By the end of the year, 37 breweries were canning their beer.

In the United Kingdom, the Felinfoel Brewery sold the first canned beer in Europe in January 1936.

In 1962, a brewing company in Pittsburg introduced the first self-opening can, which later became a pull ring tab, eliminating the need for a separate opening device.

The use of cans by craft brewers doubled between 2012 and 2014, with over 500 companies in the United States using cans to package their beverages. Previously associated with the major brewing corporations, cans are now favored by craft brewers for numerous reasons: cans are impervious to oxygen, beer-degrading light does not affect canned beer, canned beer is more portable since less room is required for storage or transportation, canned beer cools more quickly, and cans have a greater surface area for wraparound designs and decorations.

The perception that bottles lead to a taste that is superior to canned beer has been called ""just kind of dated,"" as most aluminum cans are lined with a polymer coating that protects the beer from the problematic metal. However, since drinking directly from a can may still result in a metallic taste, most craft brewers recommend pouring beer into a glass prior to consumption. In June 2014, the BA estimated 3% of craft beer in the United States is sold in cans, 60% is sold in bottles, and kegs represent the remainder of the market.

Between 2015 and 2020, the proportion of craft beer packaged in cans in the UK increased nearly tenfold to 4.9 percent.Statista.com. Distribution of craft beer production in the United Kingdom (UK) from 2015 to 2020, by packaging type.  Retrieved 8 October 2020

 Barrel-aged beer 

Goose Island first produced its Bourbon County Stout in 1992, but it was not regularly available until 2005. Other breweries began following Goose Island's lead, typically aging rich imperial stouts such as Founders KBS and The Bruery's Black Tuesday. In 2018, Food and Drink wrote: ""A process that was once niche has become not just mainstream, but ubiquitous."" Barrel-aged sour beers are a newer trend, inspired by the Belgian tradition of lambics and Flanders red ale.

 Non-alcoholic craft beers 
The market for non-alcoholic beer and wine in North America is predicted to quadruple from a base of about $20 million in 2018. Brooklyn Brewery are among the early craft breweries prepared to release a non-alcoholic craft beer, with their ""Special Effects."" Examples in Europe include Mikkeller's ""Drink'in The Sun"" and Nirvana's gluten-free ""Kosmic Stout"".

 Craft beer in Asia 

 Cambodia 
Cambodia's first microbrewery, Kingdom Breweries, opened in 2009 and brews dark, pilsener, and lager beers.

 China 

China, the world's largest beer consumer as of July 2013, is home to a growing craft beer market, with brands such as Slowboat Brewery, Jing-A Brewery, and Boxing Cat Brewery. By July 2013, the number of brewpubs in Shanghai, China had doubled since 2010. General beer consumption reached  in early 2013 and an increasing interest in craft beers developed accordingly. The Great Leap Brewing Company is one example of numerous microbreweries that have been recently established, with a localization strategy leading to the use of traditional Chinese ingredients and spices in the Beijing brand's beer production process. China's largest brewpub is located in Suzhou and is managed by the Taiwanese brewing company Le Ble D'or (金色三麥), while craft beer consumers are both ex-pats and native Chinese.

 India 
India's first microbrewery, Doolally, was opened in Pune in 2009. In 2019, Bangalore had over 60 microbreweries.

 Japan 

An early boom in small regional microbreweries followed Japan's 1994 revision of tax laws allowing the establishment of smaller breweries producing  per year. Before this change, breweries could not get a license without producing at least  per year. Beer produced by microbreweries in the early 1990s was commonly referred to as Ji Bīru (地ビール), or ""local beer."" In the late 2000s, more established microbreweries in Japan chose to emphasize the term Craft Beer (クラフトビア) to mark a break with the short-lived Ji Bīru boom and to emphasize the traditional brewing skills and reverence for ingredients that characterize their products.

 Sri Lanka 
In Sri Lanka, over-strict laws made it almost impossible for any craft beer to be brewed. On the remote East Coast, however, ""Arugam Bay Surfer's Beer"" managed to maintain a small, but popular brewpub. Established in 1977, the Siam View Hotel escaped regulations due to the long civil war and its remoteness. For two years running, the Daily Telegraph ""Best of British"" awarded the Siam View Hotel the ""Best Pub in Sri Lanka"" medal.

 Taiwan 

In Taiwan, where a single beer company dominates the market, the craft beer market has grown with brewers such as Redpoint Brewing Company gaining increasing market exposure through local bars and restaurants. This market trend has been accompanied by craft beer festivals where expat and Taiwanese brewers showcase their beer.Taiwan Business Topics. Craft Beer: a Passion, Not a Fashion.  (January 2017) Retrieved 16 January 2022

 Thailand 
Following the introduction of American microbrews in 2012, the popularity of craft beer bars in Thailand—primarily Bangkok—increased fairly rapidly and in January 2014, the fourth global location of Danish microbrewery Mikkeller was launched in Bangkok. The brand partnered with an already established beer distribution company and seeks to capitalize on the higher earning capacity of Thai people in the second decade of the 21st century, as well as tourists. At the opening, one of the owners explained: ""... and we thought it was about time to elevate the level of craft beer available in Thailand and, hopefully, expand throughout Southeast Asia."" A total of 30 beers are served at the venue, including two microbrews exclusive to Thailand.

 Vietnam 

Vietnam is the largest producer of craft beer in Southeast Asia, with microbreweries producing 31,000 hectolitres in 2018.

With a beer culture that emerged during French colonisation and further influenced by Vietnamese students returning from overseas studies, , there were 31 microbreweries in Vietnam. Established microbreweries include  Heart of Darkness Craft Brewery, BiaCraft, Platinum Beers, Fuzzy Logic and Pasteur Street Brewing Company, Rooster Beers.

There has been a boom of craft beer breweries. Despite strong tradition of drinking Czech beer there is a growing craft beer scene in the Czech Republic focused on non-traditional beer styles. Notable breweries include Matuška, Clock and Zichovec. What makes Czech craft beer unique is the common use of decoction instead of just infusion even for top fermented beers.

 Denmark 

In Denmark microbreweries have occurred throughout the country in increasing numbers. Small microbreweries often relate to restaurants and pubs, but local microbrewed craft beers are also sold in stores.Danske bryggerier  Danske ølentusiaster 

 Estonia 

Estonia has a tradition of home-brewed farm beers which are often flavoured with juniper. Craft beer came late to Estonia, but that began to change in 2012 when Mikkeller brewed a custom beer for the Estonian market, called Baltic Frontier. Then one local brewer in particular, Põhjala, led the way for other Estonian microbrewers such as Lehe, Koeru and Õllenaut. By 2017 there were nearly 30 microbreweries on the Estonian market, in a country with a population of only 1.2 million. Since 2015 Põhjala Brewery has organised an annual craft beer festival called ""Tallinn Craft Beer Weekend"".

 Finland 

The legislation in Finland allows craft breweries to sell their products directly to consumers.

 France 

France may be more commonly associated with wine, but its craft beer scene is also popular, ranging from classic farmhouse ales to experimental styles infused with local ingredients like lavender or foie gras.

Today, there are hundreds of craft breweries across France. Many draw inspiration from traditional European styles like Belgian saisons and German pilsners, while others experiment with unique ingredients like chestnuts or wildflowers.

 Germany 

Some microbreweries, such as those in Germany, have been brewing traditionally for hundreds of years. In Germany, there were 901 small breweries in 2010. The Federal Statistical Office defines a small brewery as a brewery with a production of less than 5,000 hectoliters (132,086 US gallons) beer p.a. Small breweries pay a reduced beer tax.

The total market share of the small breweries is less than 1%. 638 of them have a production even less than 1,000 hl (26,417.2 US gal.) p.a. and can be considered as microbreweries in a narrow sense. The figures apply to commercial breweries only and do not include hobby brewing.

About one third of the small breweries have a tradition going back up to 500 years, most of them in Franconia. About two thirds were founded in the last 25 years. The vast majority of small breweries operate in combination with a brewpub.

Whereas in other countries, microbreweries and brewpubs have risen in reaction to the mass production and marketing of beer, in Germany, the traditional brewpub or Brauhaus remains a major source of beer. This is mainly true for the South of Germany, especially the state of Bavaria. Upper Franconia, a district in the Region Franconia in the north of Bavaria, has the highest density of breweries in the world. Upper Franconia has about one million inhabitants and about 200 breweries. Many of them are microbreweries or brewpubs.

 Ireland 

Ireland has a long history of brewing and in the past two decades, there has been a resurgence in craft breweries. Although the Irish market remains dominated by three multinational brewing concerns (Diageo, Heineken and C&C), there have been four so-called waves of growth in the Irish craft beer market. The number of microbreweries in Ireland had risen from 15 in 2012 to over 72 by 2017. Macro breweries have pursued a policy of forcing craft taps out of pubs, through the use of incentives such as free or discounted kegs offered to publicans to replace craft brewery taps with their own.

 Italy 

In recent years, many microbreweries have opened in Italy, due to increasing beer popularity among young people. According to Coldiretti, microbreweries have grown in ten years by 1900%. There are more than 900 microbreweries active in Italy.

 Norway 

After Oslo Microbrewery was established in 1989, the number of microbreweries in Norway has expanded rapidly and sharply in the recent decades. Interest and expertise among Norwegians about craft brewed beer has risen sharply in a short time, and the old brewery traditions of this country are revived and the traditional brewing yeast kveik rediscovered.  However, most craft beers are brewed by imported recipes. Local microbreweries are scattered across Norway, from Lindesnes in the very south, and to the northernmost microbrewery in the world, Svalbard Bryggeri at Svalbard.

 Russia 
Craft brewing gained popularity in Russia in the mid-2010s. Local craft brews typically sell for between 200 and 300 roubles ($3–4) a pint. At least two dozen craft bars have opened in Moscow since the summer of 2014, serving Russian and foreign microbrews. As of 2021 there are about 250 independent craft breweries in Russia, but the share of craft beer in sales was only 1.5%.

 Spain 

In Spain in 2011, the newspaper El País reported a ""revolution is occurring in craft beer"" (cervezas artesanales) and more recently that by 2013 the trend had extended to the autonomous communities of Catalonia, Valencia, Basque Country, Navarre and Madrid.

 Sweden 

In Sweden, microbreweries have existed since around 1995. Today, the market is flourishing with many of the nation's regions and cities having their own breweries, such as Gotlands Bryggeri, Jämtlands Bryggeri, Helsingborgs Bryggeri and Wermlands Brygghus. Stefan Persson, the CEO of Swedish clothing chain H&M, has his own microbrewery on his estate in England.

 United Kingdom 

The term ""microbrewery"" originated in the UK in the late 1970s to describe the new generation of small breweries that focused on producing traditional cask ale independently of major brewers or pub chains. In 1972, Martin Sykes established Selby Brewery as the first new independent brewing company in 50 years. ""I foresaw the revival in real ale, and got in early"", he said. Another early example was the Litchborough Brewery founded by Bill Urquhart in 1974. Alongside commercial brewing, training courses and apprenticeships were offered by Litchborough, with many of the UK movement's early pioneers passing through its courses prior to setting up their own breweries.Brewed In Northants by Mike Brown with Brian Willmott. Brewery History Society (2010) 

Before the development of large commercial breweries in the UK, beer would have been brewed on the premises from which it was sold. Alewives would put out a sign—a hop pole or ale-wand—to show when their beer was ready. The medieval authorities were more interested in ensuring adequate quality and strength of the beer than discouraging drinking. Gradually men became involved in brewing and organized themselves into guilds such as the Brewers Guild in London of 1342 and the Edinburgh Society of Brewers in 1598; as brewing became more organized and reliable many inns and taverns ceased brewing for themselves and bought beer from these early commercial breweries.Martyn Cornell. Beer: the Story of the Pint

However, there were some brewpubs which continued to brew their own beer, such as the Blue Anchor in Helston, Cornwall, which was established in 1400 and is regarded as the oldest brewpub in the UK. In the UK during the 20th century, most of the traditional pubs which brewed their own beer in the brewhouse round the back of the pub, were bought out by larger breweries and ceased brewing on the premises. By the mid-1970s, only four remained: All Nations (Madeley, Shropshire), The Old Swan (Netherton, West Midlands), the Three Tuns (Bishop's Castle, Shropshire) and the Blue Anchor pub (Helston, Cornwall).Neil Hanson (ed), Good Beer Guide 1985, CAMRA, 1984. .

The trend toward larger brewing companies started to change during the 1970s, when the popularity of the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA)'s campaign for traditional brewing methods, and the success of Michael Jackson's World Guide to Beer encouraged brewers in the UK, such as Peter Austin, to form their own small breweries or brewpubs. In 1979, a chain of UK brewpubs, known as the ""Firkin"" pubs, started, running to over one hundred at the chain's peak; however, the chain was sold and eventually its pubs ceased brewing their own beer.

Some British brewpubs specialize in ale, while others brew continental lagers and wheat beers. The Ministry of Ales, Burnley; The Masons Arms in Headington, Oxford; The Brunswick Inn, Derby (in 2010, half of the beers sold by the establishment were brewed on-site); The Watermill pub, Ings Cumbria; and the Old Cannon Brewery, Bury St Edmunds are some examples of small independent brewpubs in the UK.

The city of Bristol was identified by The Guardian in May 2014 as an area where the microbrewery industry had flourished. Ten brewpubs, such as Zerodegrees, The Tobacco Factory, Copper Jacks Crafthouse and The Urban Standard, were identified as thriving Bristol craft beer establishments.

The East End of London has also been a place for speciality craft beers and unique independent pubs and breweries. Again The Guardian has a list of Craft Beer pubs in East London with local East End tour companies also showing the distinct food and craft beer pubs to London visitors with Craft Beer Tours.

In the UK there are no firm criteria for what defines a ""craft beer"". In 2019 CAMRA allowed craft keg beers to be sold at its Great British Beer Festival for the first time. Festival organiser Catherine Tonry said: ""People coming to the festival love beer in all forms and types of dispense.""

 Craft beer in the Middle East 

 Jordan 

Jordan has several companies producing beer, the oldest being the Jordan Brewery Company, which built the first Amstel beer factory outside the Netherlands in 1958 in Zarqa, and which also produces Petra, the oldest local brew of Jordan. Jordan's first microbrewery, Carakale Brewery, was established in 2010 in Fuheis.

 Turkey 

In Turkey, craft beers became popular in present-day; Gara Guzu, Feliz Kulpa, Antiochs, Pablo and Graf are some Turkish craft beer brands.

 Craft beer in North America 

 Canada 

By the early 1980s, 97% of Canadian beer was produced by Labatt and Molson. The first microbrewery was the short-lived Horseshoe Bay Brewery, which was opened in 1981 by Frank Appleton and John Mitchell next to the Troller Pub in North Vancouver. It closed after a year, but Mitchell and Appleton, along with Paul Hadfield, opened the Spinnaker Brewpub in Victoria in 1984.  A number of other microbreweries subsequently opened between 1984 and 1987, including Granville Island (Vancouver), Big Rock (Calgary), Brick (Waterloo, Ontario), Upper Canada (Toronto), and Wellington County (Guelph, Ontario).

Over the next twenty years there was steady if not spectacular growth, and by 2006 there were 88 small breweries across Canada, most of them in British Columbia, Québec and Ontario. In the second decade of the century, breweries began to appear in every province at an exponential rate, and by 2018, there were over 700 breweries across Canada producing more than 20 million hectolitres. Several provinces have associations representing craft brewers, including the Ontario Craft Brewers (OCB), and the BC Craft Brewers Guild.

Since it is a provincial, not a federal, responsibility to regulate the sale of alcohol, the exact definition of small brewery, microbrewery, macrobrewery and nanobrewery, which is defined by the number of hectolitres produced, varies from province to province.

Several of the more successful microbreweries have been bought by MolsonCoors, AB InBev, and Sapporo, including Granville Island (Vancouver), Mill Street (Toronto), and Creemore Springs (Creemore, Ontario); although the new owners often claim that these operations are still craft breweries, their membership in the relevant provincial craft brewers' association is immediately terminated due to rules requiring independent ownership.

 Mexico 

In the 1990s craft beer began being produced and consumed in central Mexico, with the trend spreading throughout the country. The main producers are in Baja California, Jalisco and Mexico City. Most beer produced is exported to the United States, and the development of the craft beer industry was not aided by the presence of two large beer consortia in the country. In 2009, craft beer accounted for only 0.05% of total production. The National Association of Craft Beer Producers (Asociación Nacional de Creadores de Cerveza Artesanal) was established to support and promote the industry in Mexico.

 United States 

In the US, the craft beer movement was revived in 1965, subsequent to an earlier American era, when Fritz Maytag acquired the Anchor Brewing Company in San Francisco, thereby saving it from closure. American craft beer drinkers tend to have higher average incomes and demographically skew white, male, and Generation X; however, trends show an increasingly racially and ethnically diverse, female, and millennial demographic profile.

In a June 2014 interview, the owner of an Oregon-based microbrewery explained: ""You've got to do more than just make great beer. It's really about innovation, creativity—stepping outside the box of traditional beer marketing"", while an employee explained that ""heart and soul"" is the essence of the operation.

The turnaround of the Anchor Brewing Company in 1965, after Maytag acquired it, is considered a turning point for American beer, due to the revival of craft beer in the US, where microbrewing boomed after then-president Jimmy Carter deregulated the beer market in 1979. During the same period, others turned to homebrewing and eventually a few of these brewers started to produce on a slightly larger scale. For inspiration, they turned to the centuries-old tradition of artisan beer and cask ale production that was continuing in the UK, Germany and Belgium.

The New Albion Brewing Company was founded in 1976 and served as a blueprint for American brewers to build small-scale commercial breweries. The popularity of these products was such that the trend quickly spread and a large number of small breweries were founded, often attached to a bar (known as a ""brewpub"") where the product could be sold directly. As microbreweries proliferated, some became more than microbreweries, necessitating the creation of the broader category of craft beer.

American microbreweries typically distribute through a wholesaler in a traditional three-tier system, others act as their own distributor (wholesaler) and sell to retailers or directly to the consumer through a tap room, attached restaurant, or off-premises sales. Because alcohol control is left up to the states, the laws have many state-to-state differences.""Consumer Information."" Alcohol Laws by State. Web. 17 Feb. 2015. <http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0388-alcohol-laws-state&gt;. Following the federal US government shutdown on October 1, 2013, craft beer producers were forced into an activity lull due to the closure of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), an arm of the Treasury Department. The TTB is responsible for approving new breweries, recipes, and labels. Interest spread to the US, and in 1982, Grant's Brewery Pub in Yakima, Washington was opened, reviving the US ""brewery taverns"" of well-known early Americans as William Penn, Samuel Adams and Patrick Henry. Growth was initially slow—the fifth US brewpub (BridgePort Brewing Company in Portland, Oregon) opened in 1984, and Dock Street Brewing Company was founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1985  by Rosemarie Certo and Jeffrey Ware, and continues to operate today with multiple locations in Philadelphia, then Triple Rock in 1986, but the growth since then has been considerable: the Brewers Association reports that in 2012 there were 2,075 regional craft breweries, microbreweries and brewpubs in the US

Craft brewing is most established in the US, where changes to US law laid the foundations for the expansion of craft brewing. The 1978 Carter homebrewing law allowed for small amounts of beer and wine, and, in 1979, Carter signed a bill to deregulate the brewing industry, making it easier to start new breweries, although states could still enact local restrictions. As a result of deregulation, homebrewing became a popular hobby in the 1980s and 1990s, and, in the mid-1990s, homebrewers launched business ventures based on home-based hobby brewing.

In 1979, 89 breweries existed in the US—the Brewers Association reports that in March 2013 a total of 2,416 US breweries were in operation, with 2,360 considered craft breweries (98 percent—1,124 brewpubs, 1,139 microbreweries, and 97 regional craft breweries). By 2015, the number of US craft breweries had grown to over 4,000. Additionally, craft brewers sold more than  of beer, which represented approximately 7.8% of the US market by volume. In 2007 the largest American craft brewery was the Boston Beer Company, makers of Samuel Adams. The West Coast has the most craft breweries and the Deep South has the fewest.

The Brewers Association defines American craft brewers as ""small, independent and traditional"": ""small"" is defined as an ""annual production of 6 million barrels of beer or less""; ""independent"" is defined as at least 75% owned or controlled by a craft brewer; and ""traditional"" is defined as brewing in which at least 50% of the beer's volume consists of ""traditional or innovative"" ingredients. This definition includes older microbreweries, which traditionally produce small quantities of beer and other breweries of various sizes and specialties.

The Brewers Association defines four markets within American craft brewing: microbreweries, with an annual production less than ; brewpubs, which sell 25% or more of their beer on site; regional craft breweries, which make between  and , of which at least 50% is all malt or contains adjuncts that are used only to enhance flavor; and contract brewing companies, which hire other breweries to make their beer.

In March 2014, the Brewers Association (B.A.) updated the definition of craft beer to remove any references to the use of adjuncts in the brewing process. The change allows long-established breweries, such as Yuengling, to be defined as craft beer. The B.A. statement read:
The idea that brewers who had been in business for generations didn't qualify as ""traditional"" simply did not cohere for many members. Brewers have long brewed with what has been available to them. (Since the Brewers Association doesn't define craft beer, that idea remains up to the beer drinker. The definition doesn't differentiate what beer craft brewers brew, as long as most of what they make is beer.) The revised definition also provides room for the innovative capabilities of craft brewers to develop new beer styles and be creative within existing beer styles. The revised definition removes the subjective assessment by Brewers Association staff of whether adjuncts ""enhance"" or ""lighten"" flavor in a particular beer.

The B.A. decision also included an updated mission statement and market share goals for the industry. Association members committed to striving for a goal of 20 percent market share by 2020, and Gary Fish, owner of Deschutes Brewery and 2014 chair of the BA Board, explained:

The 20-by-20 objective is an aspirational goal for our craft community, with an inspiring symmetry. I'm convinced this goal is within our reach if we, as an industry, continue to focus on our strengths and passions—making and delivering high-quality, innovative, full-flavored beer to craft beer enthusiasts. ... Additionally, by noting a commitment to quality and clarifying the place of homebrewers and brewing enthusiasts, we further acknowledge the critical role each plays in the health and growth of the craft brewing industry.

The Brewers Association reported that craft beer production doubled between 2011 and 2016, with the number of breweries growing from 2,000 in 2011 to 5,200 in 2016. The craft breweries are also seeing an increase in beer tourism, seasonal brews, and a marketing effort to get more women involved in beer production.

In 2024, the U.S. craft beer industry experienced its largest production decline in history outside the COVID-19 pandemic, with output falling 4% to 23.1 million barrels, according to the Brewers Association. The number of small, independent breweries decreased for the first time in two decades, with 501 closures compared to 434 openings, reflecting market saturation and shifting consumer preferences, particularly among younger drinkers. Despite these challenges, craft beer's market share accounted for 25% of total retail sales, driven partly by nonalcoholic beer offerings.

 Craft beer in South America 

 Colombia 
In recent years, Colombia has seen a significant boom in the production and consumption of craft beer, with cities such as Medellín standing out as epicenters of this trend. The growth of small breweries has been driven by consumers' desire to experience more authentic and higher quality flavors, moving away from traditional industrial options. Medellín, in particular, has seen an increase in craft beer culture, with specialized bars and festivals dedicated to promoting the various local and national brands. This trend has transformed the city into a must-visit destination for craft beer lovers.

One of the breweries that has gained recognition in this movement is Cervecería FESTA, founded in Medellín with a focus on the production of premium craft beer. Inspired by Colombian culture and folklore, FESTA distinguishes itself by offering an authentic and unique experience, brewing beers that seek to reflect the essence of the country. Despite being a relatively new brewery, FESTA has managed to capture the attention of fans thanks to its commitment to quality and innovation, positioning itself as a benchmark within the city's growing beer scene.

91,51788,76452323,14978,Cavin Councilor,"Cavin Robert Councilor (born August 27, 1963 – June 19, 2002) was an American professional stock car racing driver and team owner. He had competed in the ARCA Re/Max Series from 1997 to 2001.

Racing career
In 1997, Councilor made his debut in the ARCA Bondo/Mar-Hyde Series at Michigan International Speedway, driving his self-owned No. 95 Ford, where he was running as high as second in the race before finishing 30th due to a crash that was the result of a broken axle. He then made one more ARCA start that year at Talladega Superspeedway, where he finished four laps down in fourteenth place. It was also during this year where he made select starts in the USAR Pro Cup Series, getting a best finish of fourteenth at Birmingham International Raceway. In 1998, he expanded his ARCA program, running in a majority of the races held that year with four top-tens with a best finish of seventh at Kil-Kare Speedway and Winchester Speedway.

In 1999, Councilor ran the full ARCA schedule, driving the No. 19 Chevrolet. Across the year, he earned one top-five and four top-ten finishes with a best finish of fifth at Winchester, where he started on the front row. He then ran all but two races the following year in 2000, getting two top-ten finishes at Kentucky Speedway and Berlin Raceway on his way to finish thirteenth in the final points standings.

In 2001, Councilor made only two starts, finishing 29th at Nashville Superspeedway due to a crash, and thirteenth at Memphis Motorsports Park, which proved to be his final start as a driver. Despite his driver career ending, he still remained in the now ARCA Re/Max Series as a team-owner, with multiple drivers piloting the No. 19, with Ed Berrier drive a majority of the races held that year, and taking a win at Chicagoland Speedway. He also fielded a NASCAR Busch Series entry for Berrier at Kansas Speedway, where Berrier finished in 43rd to due a crash ten laps into the race.

Personal life & death
Councilor graduated from Michigan State High School in 1981, where he was a cross-country champion, and attended Florida State University, receiving dual bachelor's degrees in both criminology and economics.

Death
On June 19, 2002, Councilor was flying a single-engine, propeller-driven Piper PA-46 alongside two other passengers in Naples, Florida, when the plane hit nose first just after taking off near the Collier County Humane Society. Councilor and the two passengers, Shawn Michael King and an unidentified second passenger, perished in the crash. Witnesses stated that they could hear the engine of the plane cutting out, while some stated that they saw the propeller of the plane stopped, which caused the plane to take a sudden and uncontrolled nose-low descent and make subsequent contact with the ground.

The investigation into the case concluded that the crash was likely the result of the pilot's failure to maintain air speed whilst maneuvering to land after the engine ceased operating, which resulted in the plane stalling, then taking an uncontrolled descent. They were not able to determine what caused the engine to fail. Toxicology reports also indicated that Councilor had diphenhydramine in his urine and blood.

92,46529,76336286,7129,Antennarioidei,"Antennarioidei is a suborder of marine ray-finned fishes belonging to the order Lophiiformes, the anglerfishes.

Taxonomy
Antennarioidei was first proposed as a taxonomic grouping in 1912 by the English ichthyologist Charles Tate Regan. The 5th edition of Fishes of the World classifies this taxon as one of the five suborders in the order Lophiiformes. It and the suborders Chaunacoidei, Ogcocephaloidei, and Ceratioidei, are more derived than their basal sister group the Lophioidei. In some phylogenies the suborder Antennarioidei is the most basal of the Lophiiformes suborders other than Lophioidei.

The relationships of the suborders within Lophiiformes as set out in Pietsch and Grobecker's  1987 Frogfishes of the world: systematics, zoogeography, and behavioral ecology is shown below.

Etymology
Antennarioidei is derived from Antennarius, the type genus of the family Antennaridae. Antennarius suffixes -ius to antenna, an allusion to first dorsal spine being adapted into a tentacle on the snout used as a lure to attract prey.

Families
The following classification is recognized by Eschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes:

 Suborder Antennarioidei
 Family Rhycheridae Hart, Arnold, Alda, Kenaley, Pietsch, Hutchinson & Chakrabarty, 2022 (Balrog frogfishes)
 Family Brachionichthyidae Gill, 1863 (handfishes)
 Family Antennariidae Jarocki 1822 (Fibonacci frogfishes)
 Family Histiophrynidae Arnold & Pietsch 2012 (starfingered frogfishes)
 Family Tathicarpidae Hart, Arnold, Alda, Kenaley, Pietsch, Hutchinson & Chakrabarty 2022 (longfin frogfishes)
 Family Tetrabrachiidae Regan 1912 (tetrabrachiid frogfishes)
 Family Lophichthyidae Boeseman 1964 (lophichthyid frogfishes)

The cladogram below shows a past classification, prior to the recognition of several new families:

Characteristics
Antennarioidei fishes are characterised by the first dorsal fin being made up of three separate spines on the head, the first being the illicium with the second sometimes being short, although this spine is not everr embedded within the skin. The pterygiophores of the first dorsal spine and the third dorsal spine have highly compressed dorsal expansions. The interhyal has a central backwards directed process that touches the preoperculum.

Distribution
Antennarioidei fishes are found in the tropical and subtropical oceans of the world, although this applies only to the Antennaridae, the other three families being confined to the seas around Indonesia, New Guinea and Australia.",2025-04-12,"['Lophiiformes' 'Taxa named by Charles Tate Regan'

96,31608,5338646,24142,Dharma Productions,"Dharma Productions Pvt. Ltd. is an Indian film production and distribution company established by Yash Johar in 1979. It was taken over in 2004, after his death, by his son, Karan Johar. Based in Mumbai, it mainly produces and distributes Hindi films.

In July 2016, a new sector of the company was launched called Dharma 2.0, which focuses on producing advertising commercials. Another subsidiary of the studio was created in November 2018, called Dharmatic Entertainment, which produces film and television content for online distribution platforms.

History
1980–1998
The company's first production was Raj Khosla's Dostana (1980) starring Amitabh Bachchan, Shatrughan Sinha, and Zeenat Aman. The film was the highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year.

The company then went on to produce Duniya (1984) and Muqaddar Ka Faisla (1987), neither of which performed well at the box office. This was followed by Agneepath (1990), which was not a commercial success at that time, but would later become a cult film. It also won a National Film Award for its lead actor Amitabh Bachchan. The company's next two films Gumrah (1993) and Duplicate (1998), which were both directed by Mahesh Bhatt, met with moderate success at the box office.

1998–2009
In 1998, the same year as Duplicate, Dharma Productions also released the romantic comedy-drama Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, which was the directorial debut of Karan Johar, the son of Yash Johar, owner of the production company. The film, starring Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Rani Mukerji and Salman Khan, proved to be a phenomenal success, and this opened a whole new chapter in the history of the company. The film won several awards, including the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment and the Filmfare Award for Best Film.

The company's next film was Karan Johar's family drama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001) featuring an ensemble cast including Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Hrithik Roshan, and Kareena Kapoor. This was followed by Nikhil Advani's romantic comedy-drama Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003) starring Jaya Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Saif Ali Khan and Preity Zinta. Both of these films earned widespread critical acclaim and emerged as major commercial successes, ranking as the top domestic and overseas earners in their respective release years.

Dharma's next release was the natural horror film Kaal (2005), which received mixed reviews from critics.

This was followed by Karan Johar's musical romantic drama Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006) featuring a ensemble cast of Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Abhishek Bachchan, Rani Mukerji, Preity Zinta and Kirron Kher. Exploring themes of marital infidelity, adultery and dysfunctional relationships, the film opened to polarizing reviews from critics and audiences upon release; however, it emerged as a major commercial success at the domestic box-office, and became the highest-grossing Indian film of all time overseas at the time of its release. It has since been regarded as a cult classic and ahead of its time, due to its central theme, storyline, and characterizations.

Dharma's next release was Tarun Mansukhani's commercially successful romantic comedy Dostana (2008) starring Abhishek Bachchan, John Abraham, and Priyanka Chopra. This was followed by Ayan Mukerji's coming-of-age comedy-drama Wake Up Sid (2009) starring Konkona Sen Sharma and Ranbir Kapoor, and Rensil D'Silva's counter-terrorism thriller Kurbaan (2009) starring Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor.

2010–present

Dharma's first release of 2018 was Meghna Gulzar's spy thriller Raazi starring Alia Bhatt and Vicky Kaushal, based on Harinder Sikka's novel Calling Sehmat. The film was a critical and commercial success. Later that year came Shashank Khaitan's romance Dhadak (2018), which launched the careers of lead actors Ishaan Khatter and Janhvi Kapoor. This was an adaptation of the Marathi film Sairat (2016). In November 2018, a new sector of the company was introduced called Dharmatic, focusing on producing digital content for online distribution.

In 2019, Anurag Singh's Kesari, a period drama based on the Battle of Saragarhi, starring Akshay Kumar and Parineeti Chopra in lead roles. The film earned Rs. 200 crores worldwide in the box office and is currently Kumar's highest-grossing film. 

Dharma released the biopic Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl starring Jahnvi Kapoor in the lead on August 12, 2020. On 12 August 2021, it released the biographical film based on the life of Capt. Vikram Batra, Shershaah which won several accolades including the National Film Award – Special Jury Award and the Filmfare Award for Best Film.

In 2024, Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Serum Institute of India, acquired a 50% stake in Karan Johar's Dharma Productions for approximately ₹1000 crore.

Filmography

 Dharmatic Entertainment 
In November 2018, Dharma Productions launched a new subsidiary called Dharmatic Entertainment. Johar revealed the focus of the division would be on developing and producing digital content for online distribution platforms. He furthermore announced that he and Apoorva Mehta, who also serves as the chief executive officer of Dharma Productions, would be jointly heading the unit, with Somen Mishra (head of creative development at the parent company) and former journalist Aneesha Baig, heading and overseeing fiction and non-fiction content.

99,34772,75981486,3542,Central Avenue (Tampa),"Central Avenue in Tampa, Florida is a road in downtown that was the heart of its African American community before being seized by eminent domain and razed for interstate construction and a park.

Location
Central Avenue runs north from downtown Tampa through the Heights district to the Hillsborough River. Originally, Central Avenue ran continuously to the river, only interrupted by Robles Park. Today, it is split by the interstate.

History
In the late 1800s, Central Avenue was situated on the western edge of the neighborhood known as The Scrub, Tampa's first African-American neighborhood. Central Avenue was first listed as Center Avenue in the Tampa City directory in 1886. At that time, the directory did not list any African-American-owned businesses on Central Ave. As Tampa began to grow, so did Central Avenue. By 1899, records show 19 black-owned businesses on the avenue, eventually also becoming home to Tampa's first African-American newspaper, The Florida Reporter.

The area grew into a thriving black business district and entertainment hot spot. One of the cornerstones of the black business district was the Cotton Club on Central Avenue, which hosted some all-time greats, including Ella_Fitzgerald and Duke Ellington. Central Avenue was one of the major stops on what was known as the Chitlin Circuit. 

The area also inspired artist Ray Charles, who wrote the ""St. Pete Florida Blues"" and Hank Ballard. Ballard, upon seeing young people on Central Avenue doing a new dance move, wrote ""The Twist"", which was later recorded by Chubby Checker and became a number one hit .

The Cotton Club was the last business standing in the historically black section of Central Avenue. It closed in 1974 due to civil unrest and interstate expansion.

A historical marker commemorating its history can be found at the intersection of North Orange Avenue and East Harrison Street on the grounds of Perry Harvey, Sr. Park

100,43245,76216763,6662,Soviet ultimatum to Estonia,"The Soviet ultimatum to Estonia was issued on June 16, 1940, with the demand to answer by the midnight of the same day. The pretext was  political activities of Estonia allegedly in contradiction to the Soviet–Estonian Mutual Assistance Treaty. The demands were to set up a new government and to allow Soviet troops into Estonia.The text of the Soviet Ultimatum to Estonia (in Russian). The Estonian government, after long deliberations, submitted the resignation to President Konstantin Päts, which he signed and an announcement was broadcast about the resignation and the expected entrance of the Soviet Army.  The Soviet forces started occupation of Estonia the next day. It was part of the Soviet occupation of the Baltic States.

Background
The Soviet occupation of the Baltic States was based on the 1939 secret protocol added to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which divided the spheres of influence of the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany., Chapter 3: ""The Baltic States Between 1940 and 1991: Illegality and/or Prescription"", In: Illegal Annexation and State Continuity. The Case of the Incorporation of the Baltic States by the USSR, Second Revised Edition, 2022,  (pdf),  (hardback)

In 1939, under Soviet pressure, the Soviet–Estonian Mutual Assistance Treaty was signed, similar to the Soviet-Latvian and Soviet-Lithuanian treaties. Under the treaties, Soviet military bases were to be established in all Baltic States, in particular, 25,000 Soviet soldiers were dispatched to Estonia. Also, the Soviet Union occupied the island of Naissaar that controlled sea access to Tallinn, the capital of Estonia.

Ultimatum
The ultimatum was handed at 2.30pm (Moscow time) on June 16, 1940, with the demand to answer by the midnight of the same day. The pretext was  political activities of Estonia allegedly in contradiction to the Soviet–Estonian Mutual Assistance Treaty. The demands were to set up a new government and to allow Soviet troops into Estonia.

In addition, Johannes Klesment claimed that Molotov declared that ""in the event no answer indicating acceptance of the ultimatum was received by the stated time, the Red Army units concentrated at the border of the Estonian Republic would be ordered to march into the country, suppressing all resistance by armed force.""Report of the Select Committee to Investigate Communist Aggression and the Forced Incorporation of the Baltic States Into the U.S.S.R, Chapter X. ""The Soviet Ultimatum to Estonia, June 16, 1940"", p. 243
 
The Estonian government decided, in accordance with the Kellogg–Briand Pact, to not respond to the ultimatum by military means. Given the overwhelming Soviet force both on the borders and inside the country, the order was given not to resist in order to avoid bloodshed and open war.The Baltic States: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania by David J. Smith, p. 19  The government submitted the resignation to President Konstantin Päts, which he signed and an announcement was broadcast about the resignation and the expected entrance of the Soviet Army.

Molotov's claims of violations were not supported by any evidence, neither in the ultimatum, nor any time later. Moreover, the position of the Soviet Union had no legal foundation, because the treaty stipulated that the resolution of disagreements must first proceed in peaceful form, by means of diplomatic negotiations.Report of the Select Committee ...,  pp. 247-249

Aftermath

On 16–17 June 1940, the Red Army emerged from its military bases in Estonia and, aided by an additional 90,000 Soviet troops, took over the country, occupying the entire territory of the Republic of Estonia.The World Book Encyclopedia The History of the Baltic States by Kevin O'Connor  It was evident that the ultimatum was only a pretext, because the amassed Soviet troops marched immediately after receiving the answer from Estonia.Report of the Select Committee ...,  p. 249

Most of the Estonian Defence Forces and the Estonian Defence League surrendered according to the orders of non-resistance,Report of the Select Committee ...,  pp. 249-250 and were disarmed by the Red Army. Only the Estonian Independent Signal Battalion stationed at Raua Street in Tallinn began armed resistance. As the Soviet troops brought in additional reinforcements supported by six armoured fighting vehicles, the battle at Raua Street lasted for several hours until sundown. There was one dead, several wounded on the Estonian side and about 10 killed and more wounded on the Soviet side. Finally the military resistance was ended with negotiations and the Independent Signal Battalion surrendered and was disarmed. 51 years from the Raua Street Battle at Estonian Defence Forces Home Page

101,39047,76113892,3979,Passing of the Buffalo,"Passing of the Buffalo (1929) is a  bronze sculpture of an indigenous man by Cyrus E. Dallin, which rests on a 5-foot-tall gray boulder located in Muncie, Indiana, United States. It is also known as The Last Arrow.

 Description 
The sculpture depicts a male figure clad in a breach cloth and a full-length war bonnet standing in the contrapposto position. His left hand holds a bow and his left foot rests upon a bison skull. The sculpture is placed atop a granite bolder, which is located in a traffic rotary at the intersection of Walnut and Seymor Streets. The sculpture is within sight of the only full-sized copy of Dallin's Appeal to the Great Spirit sculpture that is down the street. The original Appeal to the Great Spirit is a landmark piece in front of Boston's Museum of Fine Arts.

 History 
Geraldine R. Dodge commissioned the sculpture, and it was initially located at Hartley Farms, her Madison, New Jersey estate. Dallin visited the site at the time of its installation and selected the boulder on which it rests. Dodge was an avid collector of sculpture and a significant benefactor of Dallin with twenty of his works in the auction of her estate.

The sculpture is significant in that in the 1975 Sotheby Parke Bernet auction, it set the record for a piece of Sculpture by an American with a sale price of $150,000. The sculpture was purchased by the wife and family of Fred J. Petty in his honor. Initially the sculpture was placed at the intersection of Walnut and Charles Street in front of the Ball Stores department store.

In 1999 the Ball Store edifice was torn down and the sculpture moved to the Minnetrista Museum and Gardens on the scenic shore of the White River. It was moved to its current downtown location on September 26, 2007.",2025-03-23,"['1929 sculptures' 'Allegorical sculptures in the United States'

102,16604,75458579,14964,Battle of Agios Dometios,"The Battle of Agios Dometios (), was an engagement between Hellenic, Hellenic Cypriot, Turkish and Turkish Cypriot forces between 14 and 17 August 1974. It was part of the Attila-2 (Second phase of the invasion) operation as described by Turkey and the wider battle for Nicosia as described by Cyprus.

 Initial Turkish assault 
In the early morning on 14 August 1974, Turkey violated the ceasefire agreement signed on 23 July by massing an assault against on all sides, attempting to take Morphou, Famagusta, the Mesaoria, Karpasia and Nicosia in an operation they called, Attila-2. In Nicosia, at approximately 5 am, the Turkish Air Force bombarded National Guard targets alongside the ELDYK camp in Agios Dometios and additional shelling by Turkish artillery on the area.

Somewhere around 7,000 were used to take the ELDYK camp and the area surrounding it with approximately 700 Turkish forces moving on the ELDYK camp on the first day with additional M48 tanks arriving by 15 August (second day of the fighting) in order to assist the Turkish infantry forces.

 Greek-Greek Cypriot defense 
The 336 Reserve Battalion was in charge of defending the area between Ledra Palace and the ELDYK military camp, encompassing around 3.5 kilometers.

Some 319 ELDYK soldiers were in charge of defending their camp and the area around it, such as the grammar school. On 15 August, Lieutenant Colonel Stavropoulos requested assistance against the Turkish M-48s but was only offered a few Marmon-Herringtons which were mostly ineffective against the M-48s. The fighting around the ELDYK camp continued until 16 August, and on that day the fiercest fighting took place with heavy bombardments against the camp from the Turkish air force and constant barrages by artillery and tanks making it almost impossible for the Greek soldiers to do anything due to the lack of both air and ground support with the ELDYK camp eventually falling into Turkish hands and ELDYK suffering more than 83 casualties as a result of the fighting.

In the morning of 16 August, whilst also attacking the ELDYK camp, the Turkish armed forces also tried breaking through the defensive lines and fighting especially hard to take the Imprisoned Graves, using all available air and land assets and Turkish infantry using narrow roads to try and outflank Greek Cypriot units there however in this case were unsuccessful.

The Turkish Regiment in Cyprus (TURDYK), the 2nd battalion, 50th Infantry Regiment attempted to re-encircle Nicosia airport after taking the grammar school however were met with resistance from the 212 Infantry Battalion and A' Raider Squadron, which is reportedly where Manolis Bikakis took out multiple Turkish tanks and as such, prevented a further advance into Agios Dometios.

On 17 August, although the ceasefire was in place, the Turkish military tried to advance near the old Church of Agios Pavlos however were unsuccessful and after the attempt, fighting had since ceased on the front.

 Aftermath 
Though the Turkish assault on the ELDYK camp was eventually successful, the Greek-Greek Cypriot forces successfully defended most of Agios Dometios-Agios Pavlos and preventing key areas such as the Imprisoned Graves, from falling into the Turkish hands. There have been several claims by former ELDYK fighters about Turkish war crimes after the battle such as decapitation of dead soldiers' bodies and the dead also being thrown into mass graves.",2025-04-16,"['1974 in Cyprus' 'Turkish invasion of Cyprus' 'Battles involving Cyprus'

106,27796,75749442,3637,Kobe Site,"  is a complex archaeological site with the traces of a Kofun period settlement, located in the Araki neighborhood of the city of Usa, Ōita, on the island of Kyushu Japan. The tumulus was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 2021. 

Overview
The Kobe Site is located at the east end of a low terrace overlooking the west basin of the Tsukan River, and the Kurokuro River. It contains various remains from the late Yayoi period to the Kamakura period; however, the traces of a ring-moated settlement with pottery from the early Kofun period is particularly important. As a result of ten archaeological excavations, it is estimated that the plan of the settlement was rectangular or irregularly circular with rounded corners, approximately 120 meters on each side. On the west side, there are the traces of at least two large large pillared buildings measuring 10 to 15 meters on each side, which are of a later date than the surrounding moats. The state of the buildings inside the moat is unknown because a full-scale survey has not been conducted, but as it is contemporary with the Akatsuka Kofun, the oldest tumulus in the nearby Kawabe-Takamori Kofun Cluster, it is likely to have been a settlement occupied by the local rulers whose tombs are the tumuli in that kofun cluster.

There is also the Izhorian culture center working where visitors can learn handicrafts or the Ingrian language.

The museum's collection was started in 1990 and in 1993, the museum opened to the public in the building of the former Ruchyi elementary school. The collection is regularly updated, mainly by residents of surrounding villages. The collection includes housewares, an archeological exhibition, and photographs from the beginning of 20th century complementing the exhibition of the history of the Izhorian people.

 History 
The museum's collection on Izhorian history and culture was founded on April 1, 1990. On October 1, 1993, the museum was opened with the support of the Baltika fishing team; the museum was located in the building of the former Ruchyi elementary school. At the beginning, the museum was rather small, had departmental status and a very narrow exhibition but after a few years, it gained status as an ethnographic one, and its collection grew. The growth came from donations from residents of surrounding villages and other places inhabited by Izhorians.

In 2014, the museum started to study Izhorian traditional pottery, planning to revive it, so it opened a pottery center. In 2015, the museum team fully changed. In 2019, the museum's rebuilding work their work attracted the attention of the Nord Stream 2 enterprise, which helped the museum financially. At the beginning of 2019, the first stone of the future language and handicraft center was laid; center's main specialty was pottery. The center was constructed from June to December 2019, and was inaugurated on March 13, 2020, by the governor of Leningrad Oblast Aleksandr Drozdenko.

Museum and center were working at April 2022. pdf

 Description 
Izhorian Museum is located in Ruchyi, a village in Vistino, a rural settlement in Kingiseppsky District, Leningrad Oblast. While Ruchyi village is located next to the rural settlement center, the museum is near the border of these two places, but most of the sources locate the museum in Vistino. The museum has two buildings; a former elementary school built in 1960s houses the museum exhibition while a newer building, which was built in 2019, is used by the Ingrian language and handicrafts center. A wooden anchor has been placed near the museum entrance.

The museum and the center are controlled by the Department of Culture of Kingiseppsky District Municipality, staff consists of a director, a curator, a guide, and a part-time cleaner. The museum has 1,500 visitors annually, coming mostly from Leningrad Oblast, Saint Petersburg and Finland.

 Museum 
The museum exhibition occupies two rooms on the building's first floor. The exhibits show the history of Izhorians from stone tools and other archeological finds to 20th-century images and housewares. A notable part of the exhibition is about fishing: there are hooks, fishing nets, floats, fishermen's clothing, and some models of traditional Izhorian fishing boats. Farming tools and some personal belongings are also exhibited. Traditional Izhorian clothes, mostly female , are a valuable part of the museum collection. There are casual and festive outfits made in the 19th and 20th centuries, fabric and knitted goods with traditional ornaments. There are also working tools of tailors and weavers, and traditional round chests for dowry. Pottery items are the important part of the collection; these mostly originate from the Bolshoye Stremleniye village. Drawings and documents complement the collection. Most of the housewares in the museum were donated by inhabitants of Vistino and other Izhorian villages in the area.

An archeological exhibition has artifacts from kurgans excavations in Kingiseppsky and Lomonosovsky Districts, including items from a 14th-century Izhorian grave and a 16th-century stone cross from Bolshoye Stremleniye village. The museum employees organized a folklore ensemble, participate in organisation of local holidays and festivals.

 Language and skills center 
The language and skills center building consists of a fully equipped pottery warehouse, an exhibition hall and few staff rooms with an area of 153 m2. Aside from research on Izhorian traditional pottery, it holds classes for children and teenagers, and teaches weaving, knitting, traditional toy-making and making of Kukushkoittu clay whistles.

117,52055,76462463,9116,Lynching of John Lee,"John Lee was an African-American man who was lynched on August 12, 1911, in Durant, Oklahoma. After assaulting a woman who had given him some food, he shot her in the hip while fleeing the scene. When a large mob found him, a brief shootout took place; Lee was killed, while he hit no one with his revolver. His body was set on fire. Afterward, the local black residents left after being subjected to threats and violence.

 Background 
Durant, Oklahoma, in 1911, was situated in the heart of ""Little Dixie,"" the southeastern Oklahoma region characterized by its cultural ties to the southern states. Following the turn of the century, a significant influx of new residents arrived in Oklahoma, primarily from southern states such as Texas, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky. This demographic shift contributed to the establishment of a new cultural identity in Bryan County, with a population predominantly comprising white residents at 86%, alongside a minority of African American residents at 7%.

The town of Caddo, Oklahoma, 14 miles northeast of Durant, had a small African American community on the east side of the MKT Railroad lines. Many of the residents worked as cooks, labors, and house keepers in Durant and the local area. Others living outside of Durant and Caddo city limits owned and worked their own farms. The community in Caddo was large enough to support a small church congregation, some businesses, and social activities like dances.

Although the citizens of Durant employed African Americans, interacted acted with them in agricultural business, and as the county seat, in 1908 Durant touted itself, when lobbying for a state school location, that it was a moral city, “without Negros, dives, joints, or lawlessness; and as white as the dropping snow.""

 Events leading to the lynching 
John Lee's background before arriving in Durant remains largely unknown. He was reportedly staying at a railroad YMCA camp in Denison, Texas, under the alias Jim Jennigan and seen in Caddo for only a few days prior. It is suspected that John Lee was responsible for the death and robbery of G. C. Freeman, the Secretary of the Denison YMCA, while in Armstrong, Oklahoma.

In the early afternoon of August 12, 1911 John Lee came to the house, between Durant and Caddo, of Fanny Campbell asking for food. She invited him in and gave him a meal. At the time Fanny Campbell was at the farm house with her 3 young children and her husband was in Durant on business. There are conflicting reports, but she was physically and possibly sexually assaulted. As John Lee fled the house he fired 3 shots hitting Fanny Campbell once in the hip, lower abdomen area.

Following the assault, Deputy Sheriff McFatridge, Chief Deputy Norman, and Constable Early led a large mob of 500 armed men gathered to search for John Lee. a large mob, numbering around 500 armed men and led by local deputies, pursued Lee. There was a brief shootout, with John Lee emptying his revolver and a ""rain of bullets was poured into him."" None of the mob was injured by his shots, while Lee's body was ""torn to shreds.""

John Lee's body was slung over the sheriff's horse and brought back to Durant. There Fanny Campbell was able to identify John Lee's body as her assailant. She was then taken to hospital in Sherman, Texas, as her condition deteriorated. Fanny Campbell died during the night. The mob then moved to the railroad tracks adjacent to the train station. A pile of wood was assembled, the body was placed upon it and set on fire.

 Aftermath and legacy 
Starting the following day local black families started to be cleared out by intimidation and force. Newspapers across the state talk about the mass exodus of black people from the area often walking away from their homes, land, and personal belongings. Throughout Durant and Caddo, signs were posted that all blacks had until next Saturday to leave the city and was signed ""Kaddo Klan – Our motto is a clean town. Password: We Do.""

Black community papers in Oklahoma openly discussed the injustice and called for equal protection under the law. This built into rumors of a black mob forming to attack Caddo and Durant via the railroad. Families from the surrounding area came into Durant, hundreds of dollars of ammunition were bought up, and people fortified themselves in their houses. A report was sent down the line from Atoka, Oklahoma, on August 15 that an armed black mob had stopped and boarded a freight train, but when it arrived at the stations it was empty.

On September 2, 1911, a gang of white men on horseback with torches surrounded the homes of the remaining black families living between Durant and Caddo. Shots were fired at the house and the homeowners fired back and killed one of the men. Two black men were arrested and charged. Instead of taking them to Durant, where the county jail is located, the men were taken to Tishomingo, Oklahoma out of fear of another lynching. The two were not taken to trial seeing that it was an act of self-defense.

As a result of these acts the entire black community of Caddo was eliminated and Bryan county in the 1920 census only had a black population of 4.5%. A Durant commercial brochure from 1912 reported a city population of 8,000, “all white, ... no Negroes are allowed to pitch their tent within the city's confines, and none of them live within many miles of it”",2025-04-18,"['Wikipedia Student Program' 'Lynching deaths in Oklahoma'

Structure

 Origin 
The dorsal nasal artery is one of the two terminal branches of the ophthalmic artery (the other being the supratrochlear artery). It arises in the superomedial orbit.

 Course and relations 
It passes anteriorly to exit the orbit between the trochlea (superiorly), the medial palpebral ligament (inferiorly). It gives a branch to the lacrimal sac before bifurcating into two branches: one branch anastomoses with the terminal (angular) part of the facial artery and is important for the blood supply of the face; the other travels along the dorsum of the nose to supply the outer surface of the nose, and forms anastomoses with its contralateral fellow, and with the lateral nasal branch of the facial artery.

 Distribution 
The dorsal nasal artery contributes arterial supply to the lacrimal sac, and the outer surface of the nose.

In around 20% of individuals, it also supplies the tip of the nose.",2024-05-20,"['Arteries of the head and neck' 'Human head and neck'

122,50963,369509,7559,Colonel Charles Pinckney,"Charles Pinckney (March 7, 1732 - September 22, 1782), also known as Colonel Charles Pinckney, was a South Carolina lawyer and planter based in Charleston, South Carolina. Commissioned as a colonel for the Charles Towne Militia in the colonial era, he was widely known as ""Colonel Pinckney"". He had a rice and indigo plantation known as Snee Farm along the Wando River, about nine miles from Charleston, and a townhouse on Queen Street in the city.

Captured by the British in 1780 in the fall of Charleston, Pinckney was among more than 160 men who signed loyalty oaths to protect their properties, which the British would otherwise have confiscated and possibly destroyed. After the war, to penalize his Loyalist oath, the state legislature assessed a fine against Pinckney based on the value of his property.

His son and namesake Charles Pinckney inherited the plantation and slaves and became a prominent politician after the American Revolution. After participating in the constitutional convention, he was elected to three non-consecutive terms as governor of the state, and as a US Senator and US Representative.

Early life

Pinckney was born to William Pinckney and Ruth Brewton in 1732 in Charleston. He was educated and grew up in a planter family. His grandfather, Thomas Pinckney immigrated at the age of 17 to Yorktown in 1698 from Shropshire and worked as a baker's assistant. His father served as Master of Chancery. William had joined his older brother, Charles Pinckney, in setting up ""the first fire insurance company in America, the Friendly Society."" 

It was profitable, but an extensive fire in 1740 in Charleston resulted in high damages, and William suffered financially. He sent his son to be cared and educated by his wealthier brother Charles. The younger Charles Pinckney studied law, passing the bar in 1752.

Career
Pinckney became a leading attorney in the city of Charleston. He bought his first plantation, now known as Snee Farm, in 1754, as a mark of his early success. The 715-acre plantation was used to produce the commodity crops of rice and indigo.

He also became a public figure, serving as colonel and commanding officer of the Charles Towne Militia, after which he became widely known as ""Colonel Pinckney"". He was elected as a member of the General Assembly, the lower house of provincial government in South Carolina. In 1775, he was elected as president of the South Carolina Provincial Congress.""Charles Pinckney"", Snee Farm, History&Culture, National Park Service

During the American Revolutionary War, Colonel Pinckney was among many persons captured by the British during the fall of Charleston in 1780. South Carolina Governor John Rutledge had left the city, intending to carry on a state government in exile in North Carolina. Colonel Pinckney was among more than 160 men in Charleston who took a loyalty oath to the British in order to keep their properties; the British hoped these influential men would help them lead the city.

Pinckney's action as a Loyalist was extremely unpopular among the revolutionary forces. After the war, in February 1782, the South Carolina legislature voted a 12% amercement, or fine, against Colonel Pinckney's property to punish him for his switch of allegiance.

On his death in 1782, Pinckney left the Snee Farm plantation and its slaves to Charles, his oldest surviving son. There were 40 slaves recorded in the probate record.Susan Hart Vincent, of Historic Land Design, Charles Pinckney National Historic Site: Cultural Landscape Report, pp. 16-18, Department of Interior, 1998, full text at Internet Archive. Accessed February 8, 2024. Colonel Charles Pinckney was buried at St. Philip's Church in Charleston.

Marriage and family
Pinckney had married his first cousin, Frances Brewton (b. June 11, 1733). She was a daughter of his uncle Robert Brewton, a goldsmith who was associated with banking and financial circles in the city, and Mary Loughton, a widow.

Frances's siblings included an older brother Miles Brewton (1731-1775) (named after his paternal grandfather) and younger sister Rebecca Brewton (1737-1815) (named after her paternal aunt). Before the Revolutionary War, Miles had become wealthy, based largely on his success as a slave trader and merchant in Charleston. Their sister Rebecca married Jacob Motte, also a planter, who had a townhouse in Charleston. After Miles and all his family were lost at sea in August 1775 on their way to Philadelphia, where he was to serve as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress, Frances and her sister Rebecca jointly inherited Miles's mansion in Charleston, which is now known as Miles Brewton House.

The Pinckneys had several children, Charles (his namesake), Thomas (named after Pinckney's paternal grandfather), Miles Brewton (named after Frances's brother), Mary, and Rebecca Pinckney.Pinckney Family: ""Colonel Charles Pinckney"", Snee Farm - History & Culture, National Park Service. Accessed February 8, 2024.

Legacy

In 1782, the younger Charles Pinckney inherited Snee Farm, the rice and indigo plantation, and its numerous enslaved African Americans at his father's death. A monument originally intended for his father's grave was moved to Snee Farm because his age was carved incorrectly. The younger Pinckney became a leading politician after the Revolutionary War.

Biography
Early life
Ivan Moscovich was born to Jewish Hungarian parents on 14 June 1926 in Novi Sad in the Yugoslav province of Vojvodina and had a sheltered, middle class childhood. His father, a professional painter, escaped into Yugoslavia after World War I and opened a photographic studio there which he named Photo Ivan after his son.Commemorative Ceremony on the Occasion of the 72nd Anniversary of the End of the Second World War and the Liberation of Concentration Camps Reden Neuengamme, 3 May 2017

World War II and Nazi concentration camp prisoner
In 1941, Yugoslavia surrendered unconditionally to the Axis powers during World War II.  Hungary occupied Vojvodina.  In January 1942, Moscovich's 44 year old father was a victim of the Novi Sad massacre.Master of Mysteries:  Ivan Moscovich likes nothing better than a riddle wrapped inside an enigma By Charles Hirshberg, Popular Science,, 6 May 2002  In 1943, Hungary started secret armistice negotiations with the Allied Powers which was discovered by Germany resulting in the German occupation of Vojvodina. Soon after, at the age of 17, Moscovich was taken to the concentration camp at Auschwitz with his grandfather, grandmother, and mother.  His grandparents were immediately taken to the crematoria and were killed.  While his mother remained imprisoned at Auschwitz, Moscovich was sent to Wustegiersdorf, one of the surrounding work camps, and put to work laying rail lines.

In January 1945, Auschwitz was evacuated and Moscovich along with 60,000 prisoners marched west to Bergen-Belsen.  After only a few days, Moscovich volunteered for a selection of 500 volunteer prisoner workers.
These volunteers were sent to clear the railway station in Hildesheim by dislodging the wagons to free the rails so they could be fixed and used for German transports.  While there, several groups found food supplies including sugar, butter, and eggs.  On 22 March Hildesheim was bombed, killing or wounding both prisoners and German guards. The volunteers were made to move the bodies for easier identification.

They were then marched to the Hannover-Ahlem prison camp. The prisoners worked in an asbestos mine converting it into an ammunition depot safe from aerial attacks.  Hannover-Ahlem was evacuated on 6 April 1945 and Moscovich marched towards Bergen-Belsen again.  Moscovich described the last days in Bergen-Belsen as “the ultimate in human misery, suffering, degradation, death and humiliation”.  He hid himself among a pile of dead bodies to avoid the Germans.

British soldiers liberated Bergen-Belsen on 15 April 1945. Moscovich, who had endured four concentration camps and two forced work camps, was sent to Sweden for recuperation, and while there he was reunited with his mother who had been liberated from Mauthausen by American troops.

Life after World War II (1945–1952)
Moscovich got his first job in Yugoslavia when a friend in Tito’s Ministry of Transport offered him a position repairing Yugoslavia’s railway system which had been damaged during the war. The job required a large, untested German machine using high electrical wattage to weld rail lines.  By 1947, Moscovich reported directly to the deputy minister.

Moscovich was given control over a squad of 50 German prisoners of war including some high ranking German officers, some regular soldiers, some Wehrmacht, and some SS. Although he considered taking his revenge, Moscovich elected to increase their rations in order to increase their productivity. However, he never told them he was a camp survivor. After six months, Joseph Tito released the workers.

During the time he worked the position, he received a medal from Tito himself.

Later years
After finishing his university studies in mechanical engineering at the University of Belgrade, Moscovich emigrated to Israel, where he initially worked as a research scientist involved in the design of teaching materials, educational aids, and educational games.Ivan Moscovich: Puzzle Master and Inventor Big Think

Moscovich died on 21 April 2023, at the age of 96.

Artist

Moscovich's kinetic art and other art creations have been shown in major art exhibitions at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, the International International Design Centrum in Berlin, and the Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico City. He patented his harmonograph drawing device in 1967, and had a show of harmonographic art at the National Museum of Mathematics (MoMath) in New York City on 21 October 2021.The Harmonograph Art of Ivan Moscovich by Art of Play, 14 October 2021 In 2019, the Museum of Tolerance featured a retrospective of his work.The Brain Games that Saved 93-Year-Old Ivan Moscovich by Erin Ben-Moche, Jewish Journal, 3 July 2019

139,7527,5271392,6840,Rosemary Rapaport,"Rosemary Rapaport (29 March 1918 in St Albans – 8 June 2011 in Olney) was a violinist and music teacher who founded the Purcell School for musically gifted children.

 Early years 

Nancy Rosemary Peace Rapaport was born into a Rabbinic family.  She was the youngest of four daughters who all showed artistic talent.  Although handicapped as a child by a double mastoid infection, she took up the violin at the age of eight.  She also had lessons in piano and ballet.  She was home educated until the age of 12, after which she attended the North London Collegiate School.  In 1937 she was awarded an Associated Board scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music, winning two medals for her violin playing.  Her teachers included Rowsby Woof and Frederick Grinke.

In 1941 she left the Royal Academy of Music and joined the Halle Orchestra.  While in Manchester she married Gerard Heller, an insurance dealer who was an amateur pianist.  They later moved to Leeds where she formed a duo with Fanny Waterman with whom she gave recitals in schools under the auspices of the local education authority. She taught at the Leeds Girls' High School from 1943 to 1947.

After World War II she and her husband moved to London where she formed a partnership with the Viennese pianist Else Cross that lasted for over 25 years.  Their concerts included recitals in the Wigmore Hall.  Their programmes included rarely heard classical works as well as the standard repertoire.

 Purcell School 

Rapaport had long been of the opinion that there was a lack of suitable education for exceptionally gifted musical children.  She visited Czechoslovakia where she was able to see specialist schools in operation.  On her return, she and her friend Irene Foster decided to set up a school which would cater for children with special musical talent.

In 1962 they founded the Central Tutorial School for Young Musicians.  They persuaded Sir Thomas Armstrong (Principal of the Royal Academy of Music), Keith Falkner (Director of the Royal College of Music), Yehudi Menuhin and Fanny Waterman to be their Patrons.  There were only four pupils at first, using temporary accommodation at the Conway Hall, London, and then at Morley College.  Numbers grew, and they moved to their own premises in Hampstead.  Rapaport was involved in the daily running of school.  As numbers continued to grow, however, it became necessary to move again, and the school, by now called the Purcell School, moved to a large house in Harrow.  Later it moved again to its present site in Bushey in Hertfordshire.  During these later years Rapaport's direct involvement lessened, but she maintained close links with the school, taking an interest in the pupils’ progress.

 Later years 

In 1947 she returned to the Royal Academy of Music as a professor of violin. In 1958 she was made a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Music (FRAM). After her husband's death in 1958, she set up the Gerard Heller Memorial Quartet Prize which was to be awarded biannually to string quartets from leading music colleges.  In 2005 it was awarded to the Sacconi Quartet. 

In 1967, she left London to live in Newton Blossomville, a small village in Buckinghamshire near the Bedfordshire border.  Sir Thomas Armstrong had a house there to which he and his wife moved on his retirement from the RAM.  Rapaport continued to teach: at the RAM, privately, and at Bedford High School  the Dame Alice Harpur School and the Perse School.

After the death of Lady Armstrong, she and Sir Thomas moved to Olney where they set up a house together, sharing their love of music whilst each retaining their own space. She cared for Sir Thomas in his final days, and continued to live in the house after he died in 1994.

Rosemary Rapaport was small in stature but with strong views which she communicated with authority.  She liked a good argument and could hold forth about a wide variety of topics.  As a teacher she was demanding but always kind, insisting on a good technique and instilling a love of music in all her pupils.  For many years she was accompanied everywhere by Fingal, her West Highland Terrier, who would sit on the foot of any pupil who was tapping it to the music.  She was an animal lover and supported the Wood Green Animal Shelter.

Some of her pupils became lifelong friends, always keeping in touch with the teacher who had inspired them to play their best.",2025-03-28,"['English classical violinists' 'British music educators'

140,12912,75345447,4446,Jōshinzuka Kofun,"The  is a Kofun period burial mound located in the Kamisanzai-chō neighborhood of the city of Saito, Miyazaki Prefecture in Kyushu Japan. The tumulus was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1980.

Overview
The Jōshinzuka Kofun is a rectangular -style tumulus, located on the left bank of the Sanzai River, at the southwest end of the Azukinohara Plateau at an elevation of 65 meters. It stands in isolation, and the surrounding moat and outer embankment remain almost completely intact. The tumulus measures approximately 24 meters on each side and has a height of 3.3 meters. The surrounding moat is approximately 2 meters wide and the outer embankment is 40 meters on each side, with a height of 1 meter. When the Saito City Board of Education excavated the farm road that runs adjacent to the south side of the burial mound in conjunction with the prefectural farm road maintenance project in 2002, they found a ditch on the outside of the outer embankment. No excavations have been carried out on the mound.

A portion of the stone from the stone burial chamber is exposed, and its shape suggests that the burial facility was a side-pit type stone chamber. It is estimated that it was built in the first half of the 7th century, very late in the Kofun period, when keyhole-shaped tombs were no longer being built. The name of ""Jōshinzuka"" comes from a legend of a Buddhist monk named Jōshin, who became a sokushinbutsu by walling himself into the burial chamber and reciting sutras until he died. Currently, a small Jizō-dō chapel occupies the southern end of the top of the tomb for memorial purposes.

The tumulus is approximately 19 kilometers northwest of Sadowara Station on the JR Kyushu Nippō Main Line, or ten kilometers southwest of the Saitobaru Kofun Cluster.",2024-11-14,"['Square Kofun' 'Kofun period' 'History of Miyazaki Prefecture'

Career
Whalley began his football career at Crewe Alexandra, making his club debut in a 4–1 League Cup first round win over Rochdale at Gresty Road on 18 August 1992.Crisp, p.124. He scored his first two Crewe goals in a 6–1 FA Cup second round victory over Accrington Stanley, played at Blackburn's Ewood Park, on 5 December 1992, and was part of the Crewe side beaten by York City after a penalty shoot-out in the 1993 Football League Third Division play-off final at Wembley Stadium on 29 May 1993, his penalty kick being saved by Dean Kiely. Whalley then featured only sporadically during Crewe's promotion-winning 1993–1994 season, before helping the club to Second Division play-off semi-final places in the following two seasons. In 1996–1997, he was part of the team that beat Brentford 1–0 at Wembley in the 1997 Football League Second Division play-off final,Crisp, p.128. and (along with fellow Crewe midfielder Danny Murphy) was named in the Second Division PFA Team of the Year. Despite missing half the season through injury, Whalley then helped Crewe to their highest league finishing position, 11th in the second tier, in 1997–1998.Crisp, p.129. During his time at Crewe, he made 231 first team appearances and scored 17 goals.

In July 1998, Whalley was sold to Division One rivals Bradford City for £600,000. He made his Bradford debut against Stockport County on 8 August 1998, and scored his first goal for the club in a 4–2 league win at Portsmouth on 20 October 1998, making 52 appearances across all competitions during Bradford's promotion-winning 1998-1999 season. He played just 18 Premier League games the following season, but was part of the Bradford side that competed in Europe in the UEFA Intertoto Cup at the start of the 2000–2001 season, during which he also played 19 Premiership matches and three League Cup ties, scoring in two of the latter. After Bradford were relegated back to Division One, Whalley played a further 25 games for the club before finishing the season with a seven-match loan spell at former club Crewe.

In July 2002, Whalley joined League Two side Cardiff City, making his debut at Oldham Athletic on 10 August 2002, and playing a further 22 times in a season interrupted by injury. After Cardiff won promotion to League One, he made a further 24 appearances, scoring twice for the Welsh side.

Whalley was then involved in a contractual dispute over a £50,000 appearance bonus, and had his contract cancelled by the club, signing for EFL Championship side Wigan Athletic in September 2004. He made nine appearances for Wigan before a July 2005 move to EFL League One Swindon Town, where he played for one season, making 27 appearances, then played half a season at Altrincham.

At international level, Whalley was included in a number of Republic of Ireland senior squads under Mick McCarthy but never won a full cap. He was capped at ""B"" international level.

He was appointed as an assistant coach for Manchester City under-18 team in July 2014.

148,39566,76125308,3643,Shoulder the Sky,"Shoulder the Sky is a 1945 Australian radio play by Dymphna Cusack, based on her stage play, about canteen workers in Newcastle. 

Leslie Rees said the play ""making a somewhat dangerous virtue of formlessness, has wit and bite and passion.""  He later called it "" a trenchant, plotless, constantly unfolding view of the emotional and physical conditions brought by the war to our cities"" adding:
There are Saroyanesque characters—drunks, outcasts, lost souls—as well as ordinary soldiers and girls. There are cynical-sentimental attitudes, forceful criticisms of the maladjustments of life, bitterness, mordancy, and despair, matched by optimism and faith in ordinary people. A long queue of characters jostle each other, make love, revile, drink, are sick and sorry, find the worst or best in themselves and in one another. Through it all the author seems to be pressing home the truth that the private muddle and turbulence produced by war on the home front is far from pretty, in fact ruthless and anti-social.

The play was adapted for ABC radio in 1945. 

The play was published in 1950 in a collection of Cusack's plays.    

The stage play appears have been written in the 1940s but seems to have been first performed on stage in Darwin in 1951. ",2024-06-15,"['1945 Australian radio dramas'

154,60488,76753184,53879,Karol Marcinkowski High School,"The Karol Marcinkowski High School, along with the Karol Marcinkowski Adult High School, and from 2001 to 2019 also the Karol Marcinkowski Bilingual Gymnasium, forming part of the No. 1 General Education School Complex, is the oldest public high school in Poznań, also known as Marcinek.

It occupies a neo-Gothic building at 16 , erected between 1901 and 1903 for the German Royal Gymnasium named after Augusta Victoria, whose establishment was aimed at the Germanization of Greater Poland. After Poland regained independence, on 1 May 1919, it was renamed the Polish State Gymnasium named after Karol Marcinkowski. During World War II, the building housed military hospitals, successively: German and Soviet. For this reason, the school regained its building only at the end of 1945, although classes resumed in other buildings before the city was liberated. In the 1960s, the school was associated with UNESCO, and expanded French language teaching began, since 1991 conducted by the bilingual section.

Since the beginning of the Polish institution's existence, the scout troop  has been operating alongside it, and since 1989, the Alumni Association of the Karol Marcinkowski Gymnasium and High School has also been functioning as an auxiliary organization. Over the years, the school has published numerous magazines and is also the organizer of a nationwide theater festival and local TED conferences.

 History 

 From 1919 

In 1899, Johann Frydrychowicz, the last chairman of the Jeżyce council, who lacked the support of his colleagues, leased a plot of land located at the intersection of Bukerstrasse (now Bukowska) and Cesarzowa Wiktoria (now ) streets. This plot was part of an inn of the nearby . He did so without the consent of the previous owner, Bolesław Szermer, who thereby lost an estate worth about 5,000 marks. The new owner, the penny-farthing merchant Max Lohmeyer, developed the area into a training ground for riding the vehicles. In winter, it was converted into an ice rink. After the annexation of Jeżyce to Poznań in 1900, the Prussian authorities decided to build a German state gymnasium at this location, intending to increase the number of secondary schools in the city (at the end of the 19th century, there were eight, including three boys' gymnasiums: the Catholic St. Mary Magdalene, the Evangelical Friedrich Wilhelm, and the Real Gotthilf Berger). It became a significant center for the Germanization of Greater Poland.

Construction of the building began in August 1901 according to the design by the German architect Fuchs from the Ministry of Public Works, who also supervised the construction work. The construction was completed in April 1903, and the ceremonial consecration of the building took place on 16 April 1903. Until Poland regained independence, it housed the eight-year gymnasium Königliches Auguste-Victoria Gymnasium (Augusta Victoria Royal Gymnasium). The first students were boys transferred from the Gotthilf Berger Gymnasium on . From there, part of the teaching staff and the first director Moritz Friebe, who served from 1903 to 1911, came to Marcinek. He was succeeded by Paul Schultze, who served in his position until 30 March 1919. The language of instruction was German, and most of the students were of German nationality. Polish and Jewish students formed a minority in the school. Forty-nine Polish high school students, initiated by those transferred from Berger Gymnasium, operated in the underground  during the partitions, where they learned Polish history, the Polish language, drill, and weapon handling. The number of students in the first year of the German institution's operation (1903/1904) was 489 (including 237 transferred from Berger Gymnasium), while in the last year (1918/1919) it was 569.

 1919–1945 
On 1 April 1919, the Commissariat of the Supreme People's Council appointed  as the first director of the State Gymnasium named after Karol Marcinkowski. A month later, on 1 May, the first school year was inaugurated. This date, along with the symbolic act of Polish students breaking the black Prussian eagle located above the side entrance to the building facing the playground, is considered the official start of the Polish institution's operations. Similar to its predecessor, it remained an eight-year boys' school. At that time, 358 Polish and 299 German students began their education. The German minority was divided into eight homogeneous and three mixed classes. Out of the 31 German teachers from the partition period, only seven remained, so initially, some classes were still taught in German. Some of the first Polish professors were brought by Polish educational authorities from the Galicia region. The solemn inauguration of the 1919/1920 school year took place on 1 September 1919 in the school auditorium. At that time, 677 people resumed their education (thus ranking second after the Maria Magdalena Gymnasium, which became the leading position from 1928). The first graduated ins took place in December 1919. Only three students took the Polish exam at that time, and in the following year, four. German students and teachers finally left the school at the beginning of the 1920/1921 school year. It was also then that the number of candidates taking the Polish-language exam increased sharply.

Due to the large number of students, in October 1920, it became necessary to relocate 6 classes to a separate building on Matejki Street. After their subsequent moves to a tenement house on Wyspiańskiego Street in September 1921, the  was established there as an independent institution. For those who participated in the Polish–Soviet War in 1920, the school organized a separate course of study from 1920 to 1923. For this reason (despite the separation of 6 classes), in the 1921/1922 school year, Marcinek had 706 students.

During the interwar period, Marcinek, alongside the Saint Mary Magdalene High School, was one of the best high schools in Poznań. Admission to the school for graduates of four-year primary schools was based on an entrance exam. The number of candidates at that time ranged from 3 to 5 per place. Each year, about 450 students attended the school, taught by an average of 30–40 teachers. Most of the teachers were men (the school employed only two female teachers throughout the interwar period), often working simultaneously at the University of Poznań. At that time, there were two class profiles: classical and humanistic. Emphasis was placed on the study of the Polish language and other foreign languages (including Greek and Latin). The weekly workload, with six days of schooling, did not exceed thirty hours. Most of the student community at that time came from the working intelligentsia. In 1928, the tuition fee was 110 złoty per semester, and three years later, it increased by 40 złoty. In case of financial difficulties or good academic performance, some students were exempted from paying fees.

Since 1919, the school has had a scout troop called . On 7 December 1923, the Association of Friends of the Gymnasium named after Karol Marcinkowski was founded, bringing together alumni and their families to provide financial support to students and equip classrooms. In 1921, a medical office (run by Jan Adamski for a long time) was established, and eight years later, a dental clinic. In the early years of the Polish school's operation, optional school uniforms were introduced in the form of a brown rogatywka with a purple trim and a silver (for the gymnasium) or gold (for the high school) cord. In the mid-1930s, mandatory, standardized uniforms were introduced. For the four-year gymnasium, it was a navy blue outfit with blue trim and a shield with the number 780 on a blue background, along with a navy blue cap with a blue trim. In the case of high school students, the blue color was replaced with burgundy.

In 1938, the last eight-year cycle high school graduated in took place. In the following year, the final exams were already held in a six-year cycle (four-year gymnasium and two-year high school, culminating in small and large exams, respectively). In the 1937/1938 school year, there were 480 students attending the school. The outbreak of World War II caused a break in its operations. As a result of wartime activities and repression by the occupiers, 14 pre-war teachers and 119 students (including 10 graduates of the German gymnasium) perished. During the war, the building premises initially served as German military barracks, then as a military hospital, and from February 1945 as a Red Army hospital.

 After 1945 
The functioning of the institution under the pre-war organizational system as the Gymnasium and High School named after Karol Marcinkowski was resumed on 15 February 1945, still during the battle for the city. It was the first school in Poznań to resume its activities after World War II. At that time, the pre-war Polish language teacher (working at Marcinek and the Gymnasium of St. Mary Magdalene)  was appointed as the first principal. He held this position until his transfer as the superintendent on 30 April 1945. Information about the resumption of classes was posted on handwritten cards distributed in the city by participants of secret gatherings during the war. Within the first few days, about 700 candidates applied, of which 509 were ultimately admitted. Initially, due to the operation of a Soviet hospital in the building on Bukowska Street, classes were held in buildings successively located on Jarochowskiego, Matejki, Mylna, and Różana streets.

The ceremonial opening of the school year, inaugurated with a mass at the  on , took place on Thursday, 1 March 1945. Due to the lack of an assembly hall in the building on Jarochowskiego Street, it was held in the gymnasium near . Each relocation involved students moving school equipment, which had been stored by two caretakers in wooden sheds on the school premises during the war. Lessons on Matejki Street took place from 6:30 AM to 11:00 AM, so that afterwards, the second-grade girls of the II High School could enter. Even before moving to Różana Street, students organized a march under the windows of the then seat of the Curatorium with a banner reading Wandering Gymnasium and High School No. 1 in Poznań. The school regained its own building only in December 1945. However, it required cleaning and replacing windows broken during the war. Classes were finally resumed after the winter break. The final relocation was led by Feliks Załachowski, the pre-war principal of the institution, who spent the last years of the war in a concentration camp, returning to his position in September 1945.

Initially, to make up for the lost time during the war, education for ""delayed"" years was conducted in an accelerated mode: the material of a two-year high school was covered in one year. At that time, even 25-year-olds attended school. The first post-war graduated in exams took place from 4 to 9 April 1945, followed by subsequent exams in July 1945 and January and June 1946. In the post-war Marcinek, there were three class profiles: humanistic, mathematical-physical, and mathematical-biological. In the 1945/1946 school year, 610 people attended the school. Since then, the majority of the student community consisted of youth from intelligentsia families. In the post-war years, little emphasis was placed on students' attire. The mandatory uniform was unsuccessfully attempted to be reintroduced at the end of the 1950s. On 30 October 1945, the Błękitna Czternastka Scout Troop was reactivated, and on 7 November 1946, on the hundredth anniversary of Karol Marcinkowski's death, a new school banner was funded. After the dissolution of the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association in 1949, the troop was reactivated only in January 1957. In 1967, the tradition of annual hikes to Dąbrówka Ludomska, the place of the patron's death, began, taking place on the last Saturday of September. Since 1969, their organization has been managed by the Błękitna Czternastka.

In 1948, teaching began in the four-year comprehensive high school system (following a seven-year primary school). It was also then that it adopted the name it bears to this day, the Karol Marcinkowski High School. Since 1956, it has had the status of a training school of the Adam Mickiewicz University, and since 1964, it has been part of the UNESCO Schools Association. In the 1962/1963 school year, at the initiative of the director Ludwik Graja, extended French language teaching was introduced in some classes. In the 1967/1968 school year, along with the first students after eight years of primary school, Marcinek also admitted girls for the first time, who have since constituted the majority of the student community. It was also then that the new numbering of classes I–IV (replacing the old VIII–XI) began. Due to the demographic boom of the 1960s and 1970s, the 1973/1974 school year saw a record number of students: 1,055 individuals in 28 classes.

The Student Government, active since the school's inception, initiated the hanging of crosses in classrooms in 1981. In 1991, at the initiative of the principal Marek Rybarczyk, the Polish-French bilingual section, which still exists today, was established. Education was conducted in a four-year cycle, preceded by a preparatory class with 20 French lessons per week. In 2001, the Karol Marcinkowski Bilingual Gymnasium with French language began its activity, taking over the function of the ""0"" class. It was also then that the General High School Complex No. 1 was established, consisting of the newly created bilingual gymnasium, comprehensive high school, and the adult high school existing since the 1940s. A year later, teaching began in a three-year high school cycle. In connection with the education reform of 2017, it was decided to return to the system from before 2001, i.e., a four-year high school preceded by a French-language introductory class. From 1919 to 2014, the school saw 12,706 graduates, including 1,266 individuals during the interwar period.

 Jubilees 
In 1959, celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the school were held, combined with the 1st Alumni Reunion. These were among the first such events in Poland after World War II. Ten years later, from 19 to 20 April 1969, the 2nd Reunion was again combined with the 50th anniversary of the school and the 25th anniversary of the Polish People's Republic. Over 1,000 people participated in these events. Due to the school's association with UNESCO, a solemn ceremony took place in the auditorium on 28 October 1970 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the United Nations. In 1979, a new banner was donated to the school to celebrate its 60th anniversary. The celebrations of the 70th anniversary were combined with the 3rd Alumni Reunion, which was the largest so far with over 3,000 participants. These were the first celebrations organized by the Alumni Association. Since then, they have been held regularly every five years at the initiative of the association. Since 1995, the association has also been organizing annual meetings on the second Saturday of May to commemorate the full five-year anniversaries of graduated in exams. The 80th anniversary celebrations from 15 to 16 May 1999 were honored with a concert by the band Elektryczne Gitary on the school field. On the other hand, the celebrations of the 90th anniversary from 15 to 16 May 2009 were concluded with a four-hour concert by the band Dżem. The 85th anniversary celebrations took place from 14 to 15 May 2004, and the 95th anniversary on 10 May 2014. The centenary celebrations were planned for 17 and 18 May 2019.

 Architecture 

The school complex occupies a plot of land measuring 1,200 m2 in the triangle formed by Bukowska, Grunwaldzka, and Szylinga streets, adjacent to the Poznań Old Zoo. The main two-story neo-Gothic building, made of red brick, has two lower annexes at the side elevations. Initially, one of these annexes (southern) served as the principal's residence, while the other (northern) was designated for the caretaker's house. The interior layout is semi-bay, with classrooms located on the side facing the soccer field. The hall on the ground floor, covered with neo-Gothic lierne vault, is flanked by two spacious staircases leading to the auditorium. The original restrooms were located in a separate, longitudinal building on the west side of the main building, connected to it by two arcaded skyways. In later years, a sewage pipe was added to the main building. In the northeast corner of the plot, a separate building housing the gymnasium was located, with a botanical garden attached to it from the south. The central part of the plot was occupied by a gravel soccer field. The area south of the school building and the one adjacent to the main entrance were landscaped into small green spaces.

The central, elevated part of the second floor, crowned with a tower with a clock and a platform for astronomical observations, houses the auditorium with an area of 326 m2, covered by an ornate wooden hanging ceiling. Originally equipped with a small altar and an organ loft, which were used for religious services before school ceremonies. In 1929, a stage was added to the auditorium, where performances were presented as part of the  in the same year. After 1945, it was relocated under the southern wall of the room, thus obstructing one of the entrances.

In the 1960s, new classroom pavilions were erected on the small soccer field. Due to the increase in the number of students, a major renovation of the building was carried out between 1974 and 1978. The number of subject classrooms was increased, a central locker room and library were organized, and the installations of central heating, water, sewage, and electricity were replaced. Additionally, the teachers' room, secretariat, and management offices were relocated to the southern annex of the main building. In 1988, the first computer lab was established at the school, followed by another one in 2003.

In 2002, the main entrance doors to the building were reconstructed, faithfully copying the original doors. In 2004, the roof of the main building was renovated, and the clock on the tower began operating again. In 2007, an illuminated aluminum sign with the inscription Gimnazjum i Liceum im. Karola Marcinkowskiego (Karol Marcinkowski Gymnasium and High School) was placed on the north-facing main facade of the building, at a height of about 8 meters from Bukowska Street. The stained glass windows in the school auditorium were also renovated at that time. Between 2009 and 2011, a renovation of the gymnasium building was carried out, restoring its original architectural character and refurbishing the interiors. In September 2013, a thorough renovation of the auditorium was conducted, including the replacement of the parquet floor, installation of wainscoting, and repainting of the walls.

 Memorials 

On 26 March 1925, a bust of the patron, created by the art teacher Aleksander Korpal, was solemnly unveiled in the building. On 18 April 1929, a commemorative plaque by the same author was unveiled, dedicated to the late first school principal, Antoni Borzucki, who passed away the previous year. It was dismantled and destroyed by the Germans during World War II. As part of the school's 50th anniversary celebrations in 1969, a plaque by Irena Rosińska was unveiled in the main hall, commemorating the teachers and students who died and were murdered between 1939 and 1945. On the occasion of the 70th anniversary, the reconstructed memorial plaque in honor of Antoni Borzucki was also unveiled there.

On 14 May 2005, one of the two Poznań monuments to Karol Marcinkowski, designed by Wiesław Koronowski, was unveiled in front of the main entrance. On 10 May 2008, as part of the jubilee meetings of graduating classes, a boulder with a commemorative plaque by the same author was unveiled in the garden in front of the entrance, dedicated to  – an alumnus of the school and a poet who died during World War II. On 11 May 2013, another commemorative boulder by Wiesław Koronowski and Jarosław Bogucki was unveiled, dedicated to  and Stanisław Kasznica – Marcinek graduates and soldiers who fought in World War II. The former fell during the September Campaign, while the latter was the last Commander-in-Chief of the National Armed Forces, sentenced and executed by the communist regime in 1948.

 Alumni Association 
In 1989, at the initiative of the organizing committee for the 70th anniversary celebrations of the school, the Alumni Association of the Karol Marcinkowski Gymnasium and High School in Poznań was established. On 4 April of that year, it was registered under number 167 in the Register of Associations and Unions of the Social-Administrative Department of the Voivodeship Office in Poznań, and on 27 September, it was registered under number 196 in the Regional Court in Poznań. The founding meeting took place on 24 April 1989. Zbigniew Krüger was elected as the president of the association at that time. After his resignation on 18 February 1993, Gerard Sowiński, a Polish language teacher from 1964 to 1980, assumed the position. The association's authorities are elected every four years.

The objectives of the association include maintaining collegial ties and providing assistance to the members of the association as well as to the students and alumni of the school, preserving the bonds of the alumni with the school and the region of the Greater Poland. These objectives are pursued through the promotion of publications related to the history of the school, the achievements of the patron, and the alumni; fostering patriotic ideals of the school and its patron; providing assistance to the school in the education and upbringing of students; and organizing various meetings, events, and ceremonies. Since 1989, the association has been responsible for organizing jubilee celebrations of the school, held every five years, and since 1995, it has also organized annual meetings on the occasion of the five-year anniversaries of the matura exams. Since 1994, the association has also managed the Alumni Library, where publications by the school's alumni are collected.

 In culture 
Even though the name of the high school is not mentioned in any of Małgorzata Musierowicz's books, it is recognized that almost all the youth in Jeżycjada attend Marcinek.

Two feature films were shot in the building:  in 1981, directed by the school's graduate Filip Bajon, and  in 2012, directed by Wiktor Skrzynecki.

From October 1928 until the outbreak of World War II, the school published a monthly magazine called Orlęta, which eventually gained a national character and began to be subscribed to abroad. From September 1966 for many years, the school published the Tygodnik Żakowski magazine. The rest of the numerous periodicals had a more episodic nature. From 2004 to 2015, the school published a magazine for teachers titled Pedagogia, addressing the topic of Polish education.

Since 2001, the school has been annually organizing the Marcinek Theatre Festival in Poznań, attracting theaters from all over Poland and abroad. It has been under the media patronage of TVP3 Poznań and Gazeta Wyborcza. The jury has included figures such as , , and .

In 2016, the school became the first in Poznań to receive a license to organize a local TED conference under the name TEDxMarcinekSchool. Since then, five editions have been organized: in April and November 2016, January 2017, February 2018, and February 2019.",2024-12-06,"['High schools in Poland' 'Educational institutions established in 1903'

156,9377,75237590,5879,Nina Eva Vida Jones,"Nina Eva Vida Jones  born Nina Eva Vida Harris competed as Mrs JES Jones (1882 – 1966) was an Australian racing motorist who competed in the 1930s. She was said to be the first woman from New South Wales to compete at motor racing. Her husband John Alexander Stammers Jones was a brewer.

Life
Jones was born in 1882. Her parents were Susan Mary (born Clarke) and her husband William Henry Harris. Her father was a gentleman as his family had benefited from a bequest left by second fleeter John Harris. That John Harris left about £150,000 as he had gained a huge estate based at Ultimo, New South Wales. Jones was born at Ultimo and she was home schooled.

In 1910 she married John Alexander Stammers Jones who was a keen sportsman and he owned the Zig Zag Brewery, ten hotels and, in time, two Darracq cars. Their home at Lithgow which was near the brewery until they had a house built at Darling Point which they named Nia Heymo. She first drove in a Chandler Motor Car. In 1923 she went on a tour in her car and entered a reliability trial. She began competing in events organised by the Royal Automobile Club of Australia and in 1925 she bought a Crossley Motors 20-70 model. The car had a 3.7 litre engine and was said to have a top speed of 75 mph. She won a Weekender trophy at Maroubra Speedway in that car at an average speed of 78 mph. She was said to be the first woman from New South Wales to compete at motor racing.

In 1928 her husband sold his brewery and they went on holiday to Europe. While in Italy she saw ""real"" racing involving Bugattis, Sunbeams and Bentleys. In 1929 she viewed an Alfa Romeo 6C Zagato in Italy and she had the car imported into Australia. In 1930 she beat 67 other (male) drivers at Bondi Beach where her car covered the quarter mile in 18.4 seconds.

At Gerringong the crowd came too close at the finishing line and she hit a spectator giving him a broken leg. Her daughter, Vidie, competed in her Lea-Francis car, and her son also drove the Alfa Romeo. The Alfa Romeo car nearly ended its racing following an accident in 1933. She had been cornering at high speed when a tyre was punctured and the car rolled several times. She and her daughter were thrown out and they had only minor injuries, but the car was burned out. The car was recovered and restored with new parts sent from Italy and in 1934 she had her last accident at a hill climb in Newcastle. Her son was driving when they crashed into an embankment. Jack was unhurt but she gave up competition after she spent six weeks recovering from a broken thigh.

In 1934 her husband died and their son Jack died in a plane accident. Only her daughter was still racing but she retired when she married.

Jones died in Darling Point in 1966.

163,51404,76447514,28299,Dermatologic surgical procedure,"Dermatologic surgical procedures are treatments aimed at managing a wide range of medically necessary and cosmetic conditions, with a long history dating back to ancient times.

Medically necessary dermatologic surgical procedures include curettage and electrosurgery, and Mohs surgery for the treatment of skin cancer, as well as skin grafting for repairing damaged skin. Cosmetic dermatologic surgeries comprise anti-ageing procedures, and mole and scar removal surgeries. The former include Botulinum toxin treatments and face lifts, while the latter include shave excision and dermabrasion.

Although all dermatologic surgical procedures require post-operative treatment and present common risks and complications, the future development of dermatologic surgical procedures involving the use of technology shows promising improvements in patient outcomes.

 History 

Dermatologic surgery has a long history and has evolved significantly over time. Ancient civilizations such as Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans practiced early forms of dermatologic surgery, employing techniques such as tissue excision, cautery, and scarification for therapeutic and cosmetic purposes.

The 19th century marked the emergence of dermatologic surgery as a distinct speciality, where significant advancements in surgical techniques and instruments were made. For instance, the development of aseptic techniques and anesthesia allowed for infection-free and pain-free procedures respectively, while instruments such as forceps, retractors, and cauteries improved the precision and safety of dermatological surgical procedures. The applications and safety of sutures were also enhanced by William Stewart Halsted, as he emphasized on the role of sutures in sterile tissue closure, managing hemorrhage and wound healing.

In the early 20th century, electrosurgery and cryosurgery were introduced, and surgical techniques continued to evolve from mid to late 20th century, with the introduction of surgical procedures such as skin grafting, laser surgery and Mohs microscopic surgery. The establishment of dermatology surgery societies and training programs, such as the “American College of Mohs Surgery” founded by Frederic Mohs in 1967, as well as postgraduate courses on dermabrasion and chemical peels, also contributed to the progression of surgical techniques. These advancements expanded the range of treatment options available in dermatologic surgery.

 Medically necessary procedures 

 Skin cancer surgery 
Skin cancer is the uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal skin cells, usually developing on skin exposed to ultraviolet radiation. Squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma are the three main types of skin cancer, with the former two being non-melanoma skin cancer.

 Curettage and Electrosurgery 

Most small, low-risk and superficial skin cancers, such as basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, could be treated by curettage and electrosurgery. A clinical margin which includes areas around the lesion site is marked out, and local anesthesia or numbing medicine is applied. A curette, consisting of a fenestrated head with a semi-sharp blade, is used to debride the malignant tumour. This is done by mechanically scraping or peeling at the lesion until all cancerous tissues are removed. Electrodesiccation is followed up after each curettage by applying a high-voltage electric current to the tumour site. The heat could destroy the remaining tumours not eliminated by curettage, induce inflammatory response in tumour cells, and aid in hemostasis. Treating small and superficial skin cancers with curettage and electrosurgery presents a high cure rate of over 90%.

 Mohs Surgery 
Mohs surgery could target non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancers, and is recommended as a first-line treatment for large, high-risk tumours in anatomically critical areas. After local anesthesia is applied, visible tumours are first excised using a scalpel. Then, a thin piece of tissue is removed circumferentially around the tumour and sectioned with a cryostat microtome. This is followed by tissue processing and viewing under a microscope. If any residual tumour could be identified microscopically, the tumour site could be marked for further tissue removal. This process is repeated until the absence of tumours is confirmed by these histological methods. In most patients treated with Mohs surgery, complete elimination of cancerous cells, maximal conservation of healthy tissues, and high cure rates of up to 99% are observed.

 Skin grafts 

Skin grafting is a surgical procedure where a piece of healthy skin, also known as the donor site, is taken from one body part and transplanted to another, often to cover damaged or missing skin. Before surgery, the location of the donor site would be determined, and patients would undergo anesthesia.

 Full-Thickness Skin Grafts (FTSG) 
FTSGs are the most frequently used grafts in dermatology, which involves surgical removal of the epidermis and dermis layers of the skin. After the skin graft is harvested, the donor site is stitched close, and the graft is trimmed of any underlying hair or fat tissue, as well as contoured to match the size and shape of the defect. The graft is then immediately placed onto the wound site and sutured. Finally, a bolster, which is a type of dressing, is placed over the graft to secure it in place.

 Split-Thickness Skin Grafts (STSG) 

STSGs are suitable for large wounds and relatively avascular sites where FTSGs would have a high risk of failure. Only a portion of the skin, namely the epidermis and part of the dermis, is removed from the donor site using a powered dermatome. If desired, meshing of the harvested skin graft allows it to be elongated. The graft is then applied to the defect and secured using skin staples or dissolvable sutures. A bolster is placed over the graft to conclude the procedure, while for areas where bolstering is difficult, a negative pressure wound vacuum could reduce air pressure on the wound to promote healing.

 Composite Grafts 
Composite grafts are used to repair defects that require contouring and support due to a loss of underlying muscle or bone. These grafts usually consist of different tissue layers, such as the skin, cartilage, and fat, and are frequently utilized to reconstruct structures such as the nose, ears, and fingertips. Skin from the donor site is first excised precisely and contoured as needed, then the donor site is closed in multiple layers. The graft is subsequently placed over the wound and secured by suturing, followed by the application of a bolster if necessary. Typically, minor revisions of the graft are required after the initial surgery for fine-tuning and adjustment of the graft's shape and appearance.

 Cosmetic procedures 

 Anti-ageing procedures 

 Botulinum toxin treatments 
Botulinum toxin is a neurotoxin with cosmetic and dermatologic applications, such as treating hyperhidrosis, removing facial lines and wrinkles. Among the serotypes A to G, Botulinum toxin type A is the major type used for aesthetic and clinical purposes. Before injection, it has to be reconstituted using sterile saline as a diluent. The reconstituted solution should be refrigerated and used within 4 hours to prevent its loss of function. Then, by using a hollow teflon-coated, 30-gauge 1-inch needle, the toxin could be injected directly into the affected muscles. The dose of toxin for each injection is determined by the muscle mass, while the injection site should be localized to overactive smooth muscles to induce muscle weakness. Overactive muscles can be determined by measuring the muscle's maximal response to a nervous stimuli with electromyography. Botulinum toxin could be used to relax the corrugator and procerus muscles, orbicularis oculi, and the frontalis muscle to relieve glabellar lines (frown lines), lateral canthal lines (Crow's feet) and forehead lines respectively. 

 Face lift (Rhytidectomy) 
Rhytidectomy is a surgical method, often used for making the skin look smoother and younger. This is done by first making an incision at the temples that extend around the ear, then separating the skin from the underlying fascial layers and muscles, and removing the sagging facial skin. The remaining skin is subsequently pulled backward and upward, and sutured to a new position to achieve a tightened appearance. During this process, facial muscles might be tightened, while facial fat might be removed or redistributed. Sometimes, a jaw lift is performed in the same surgery by making an incision under the chin and tightening the skin of the jaw and neck. Immediately after the surgery, a drainage tube is used to remove excess fluid from the wound.

 Mole and scar removal surgeries 

 Shave excision 
Mole removal surgeries are performed for various reasons. Atypical mole removal is performed when moles look dysplastic, as this is associated with an increased risk of melanoma; Cosmetic mole removal is performed when moles are non-cancerous, but are preferred to be eliminated due to aesthetic or practical considerations.

Shave excision is the most frequently used method for mole removal. Anesthesia is first administered to the area around the mole. With the use of a sharp razor, multiple horizontal cuts are then made to remove the mole. This is followed by electrosurgical feathering, where a small dermal loop electrode is used to gently shape the edges of the wound. This not only ensures any remaining cells of the mole are removed, but also minimizes scarring as the edges of the wound are blended with the surrounding skin. At last, the surgical site is cleaned, applied with antibiotic ointment, and covered with a sterile bandage to prevent infection.

 Dermabrasion 
Scar revisions are cosmetic treatments to improve the appearance of scars, with dermabrasion being a surgical procedure most often used for individuals with skin concerns such as scars caused by acne, surgery or injury. This skin-resurfacing procedure makes use of dermabraders, a rapidly rotating device to exfoliate the outer layer of the skin, thereby promoting the growth of new skin that is smoother in texture.

First, local or general anesthesia is employed. Next, the area to be treated is marked out, and a suitable dermabrasion tip is chosen to be used during the procedure. During dermabrasion, the skin being treated is held taut with one hand to maintain tension while the dermabrader is moved across the skin uniformly and gently. Proper manipulation, appropriate pressure and precise control of the dermabrader is crucial to ensure the accurate layer of the skin is targeted and to reduce adverse effects. Following dermabrasion, a saline-soaked gauze coupled with occlusive ointment are applied to the treated skin to prevent infection and facilitate wound healing.

 Post-operative treatment and recovery 

 Surgeries for medically necessary conditions 

For skin cancer surgeries, most wounds are relatively small. After removal of the dressing, the wound can be cleaned by washing with clean soapy water, and should be kept moist. It is also suggested to apply prescribed antibiotic ointments or any other medications to the wound, and protect the scar formed.

For skin grafts, the newly grafted skin is fragile to damage. Slight bleeding may occur, which can be managed by removing serosanguineous material or necrotic debris using hydrogen peroxide. If eschar is present which affects the grafted skin, debridement should only be done when the area of necrosis is clearly defined.

 Surgeries for cosmetic conditions 

Immediately after a dermatologic cosmetic surgery, it is generally recommended for the surgical site to be elevated to reduce swelling and maintain blood flow. Analgesics, antibiotics and anesthetics are usually prescribed to relieve pain, inflammation and swelling. Patients should refrain from vigorous exercise for the first few days after surgery and exercise caution when gradually resuming their normal activities. Showering should also be avoided during the first few days after surgery. Patients are also advised against submerging their wound in water for at least two weeks after surgery.

 Risks and complications 

During dermatologic surgery, dissecting errors may give rise to damaged structures adjacent to the surgical site, such as nerves, glands, and blood vessels. This may result in numbness, muscle weakness or paralysis. Patients with risk factors such as blood clotting abnormalities or long-term use of certain medications may experience excessive bleeding at the incision site. This would prolong the healing process and increase the risk of bacterial wound infection. Moreover, though uncommon, allergic reactions to anesthesia during surgery may also occur in some patients.

After dermatologic surgery, the presence of suture materials at the wound site can cause redness and swelling, yet these suture reactions may not necessarily indicate allergy or infection. Other common complications include hypertrophic or keloid scars, bruises, suture marks, and skin color changes, which may be temporary or permanent.

 Future directions 

Throughout the past 10 years, minimally invasive dermatological procedures have shown significant advancements, with the emergence of intradermal fillers, botulinum toxin injections and chemical peels. These techniques require smaller incisions, which could lessen scarring and trauma, and decrease surgical complications. Compared with traditional surgical methods, minimally invasive procedures are more likely to result in high patient satisfaction and treatment efficacy. With the introduction of three-dimensional bioprinting and robotic-assisted surgeries for tissue repair and reconstruction, future technological advancements might continue to diminish recovery time and improve patient outcomes.",2024-12-21,['Surgery'],"['curettage' 'electrosurgery' 'Mohs surgery' 'skin grafting'

167,20244,5305736,16783,Dinengdeng,"Dinengdéng (also called Inabraw) is an Ilocano soup-like, vegetable-based dish from the Northern Luzon, Philippines. It is flavored with bugguóng munamón (bagoong isda or fermented anchovies) and is characterized by its earthy flavor, simple preparation, and the use of fresh, locally sourced ingredients. The dish often includes grilled or fried fish to enhance its taste, making it a staple in Ilocano cuisine. 

A simple meal to prepare was necessary for the Ilocano, who often labored in labor-intensive agriculture industries. Another characteristic of Ilocano cuisine is that dishes are either salty or bitter which means dishes that went well with rice. , like its more festal sibling pinakbet, is a dish best enjoyed with rice. However, because  requires fewer ingredients, it is able to be prepared daily. 

Ingredients 
Dinengdeng highlights the distinct umami flavor of bugguóng munamón (fermented anchovy). This essential ingredient serves as the primary seasoning, giving the dish its characteristic depth and savories. It consists of a variety of fresh vegetables, including leafy greens, shoots, blossoms, legumes, and fruits. Many of these ingredients are readily available and commonly grown in the backyards and gardens of Ilocano households.

Dried shrimp or dried fish are often added to enhance the flavor of the broth. Leftover meats can also be incorporated to enrich the dish, a practice known as sagpaw or garnish. These additions may include fried or roasted fish, bagnet (Ilocano crispy pork belly), lechon (roast pig), or even fast-food fried chicken. Dinengdeng can be further seasoned with aromatics such as báwang (garlic), lasoná (native shallots), or layá (ginger). For a touch of acidity, ingredients like kamatis (tomatoes) or piás (bilimbi) may be added.

During the monsoon season, Dinengdeng incorporates ingredients that thrive in the wet climate. These include bamboo shoots (rabong), which provide a crunchy texture and earthy flavor; edible vine flowers (sabidukong), which enhance the dish's aroma with a floral note; and wild mushrooms (u-ong), which add a chewy, umami-rich element to the soup. These seasonal ingredients are often foraged, reflecting the Ilocano ingenuity in utilizing the natural environment.

In coastal areas, Dinengdeng is often enriched with seaweed varieties such as kulot (Gelidiella acerosa) a curly, soft-textured seaweed and aragan or panpan-aw (a coarse-textured seaweed with a briny taste). These additions contribute a distinct oceanic flavor that pairs well with the savory bugguóng (fermented fish paste) broth.

The dish may contain a numerous combination of the following vegetables:

Variations
Dinengdeng is characterized by its versatility and numerous variations, which are influenced by regional, seasonal, and cultural factors, as well as personal preferences. The classic version of dinengdeng typically consists of a mixture of leafy greens, shoots, and other vegetables, including long beans (utong), okra, jute mallow (saluyot), bitter gourd (parya), sweet potato leaves (uggot kamote), and moringa leaves (marunggay). These ingredients are commonly available year-round.

 Buridibod 
One variation of Dinengdeng is buridibod, which prominently features kamotig (sweet potato tubers) as the primary ingredient. The sweet potatoes are sometimes cooked until they disintegrate, resulting in a thicker, creamier soup. The natural sweetness of the sweet potatoes complements the savory and umami flavors of the dish.

 Sari-Sari 
Another variation of Dinengdeng is sari-sari, which emerged within the Ilocano diaspora in Hawaii. Introduced in 1974 by Theo Butuyan of Pangasinan at his restaurant ""Elena's"" in Waipahu, this version includes eggplant, bottle gourd, water spinach, tomatoes, and onions. It is simmered with shrimp and crispy pork belly, creating a richer and more indulgent version of the dish while maintaining the Ilocano tradition of utilizing locally available ingredients.

In popular culture

 Dinengdeng Festival 
The annual ""Dinengdeng Festival"" is the official festive event of the municipality of Agoo, La Union, Philippines held in the summer. The festival is held in celebration of the dish and to promote tourism. A large  (clay pot) is used symbolize the festival, called the ""Big Banga"". It is used during the event in cooking the . This festival replaces the old theme of tobacco, an important agricultural crop of Agoo. However, tobacco festivals are commonly celebrated throughout the country in different towns. The goal of the local government desired this festival to be comparable to other prominent festivities in the region, such as the Panagbenga.",2025-02-09,"['Ilocano cuisine' 'Philippine soups' 'Culture of La Union'

Rogers became an organiser for the Australian Labor Party in 1918, serving as secretary of the party's North Richmond branch for several years.

On 5 November 1920, she was elected to Richmond City Council at a by-election, becoming he first woman elected to local government in Victoria, and the second in Australia (after Susan Benny).

Rogers was re-elected unopposed in 1922. In 1925, she became a member of the council's finance and legislative committee, but was at the elections in August later that year.

Later life and death
In 1928, she became one of first women to be appointed a justice of the peace in Victoria, serving as a special magistrate at the Children's Court at Richmond.

Rogers died of cancer on 25 September 1932, and was buried at Boroondara Cemetery in Kew. Future federal Labor leader Arthur Calwell was a pallbearer at her funeral, where several prominent Labor and trade union officials were present.

Legacy
In March 2016, the City of Yarra (the successor to the City of Richmond) replaced the green and male silhouettes at traffic lights with a likeness of Rogers.

177,34527,75970227,6422,Metro Awakening,"Metro Awakening is a first-person shooter developed by Vertigo Games and published by Deep Silver. As a spin-off game of the Metro franchise and a prequel to Metro 2033, Awakening was released for virtual reality devices, including PlayStation VR2, Meta Quest 2 and 3, Steam VR and Viveport on November 7, 2024.

Gameplay
As with its predecessors, Metro Awakening is a first-person shooter. The game's story follows Serdar, a doctor who must venture into the treacherous Moscow tunnel system in order to reunite with his wife. The story was described by the team as the origin story for Khan, a stalker with a supernatural skill in the Metro universe, and the story takes place before the events of the first game. The game's combat will be slower, as the game's protagonist is not a skilled soldier. Players can use various firearms to fight against enemies, though bullets in the game are scarce. Alternatively, players can utilize stealth tactics during enemy encounters.

Development
The game was developed by Vertigo Games, the studio behind other VR games such as Arizona Sunshine and its sequel. The studio worked in close collaboration with Dmitry Glukhovsky, who served as the game's lore consultant. The team felt that Glukhovsky had written a very ""personal"" and ""emotional"" story for Awakening, and therefore, changed the overall game direction to a more story-driven one. Vertigo chose Khan to be the game's playable character. Unlike Artyom, the series' silent protagonist, Khan was fully voiced. The team also worked closely with 4A Games, which provided the team with gameplay assets and models they had used during the development of earlier games in the series.

Awakening was announced in January 2024. The game was released worldwide on November 7, 2024.

Reception
According to Metacritic, the game received ""generally favourable reviews"".

178,26253,75726554,6381,San Francisco Fire of 1863,"The San Francisco Fire of 1863 (October 23, 1863) was a significant fire incident in San Francisco, California, causing substantial damage and displacing numerous residents.

 History 
The fire originated at 1:30 AM in the rag store owned by Charley Orley located between Sacramento and California streets, bounded by Davis and Drumm streets. The entire block, primarily consisting of wooden structures, was engulfed by the flames, except for two buildings on the southwest corner and a portion of another on the corner of Drumm street.

The San Francisco Fire Department promptly responded to the scene, and their heroic efforts were complemented by nearly 200 Russian sailors from the Russian fleet anchored in the harbor. Led by Lieutenants Seraggen, Eholen, and Mackaoff, the sailors worked collaboratively with the firefighters, using both buckets and fire engines to combat the blaze.

The fire caused extensive damage, resulting in the complete destruction of the block. Preliminary estimates indicated losses exceeding $100,000 (equivalent to $2.51 million in 2024), impacting businesses and individuals. Many residents lost their homes and possessions, leading to significant hardship.

Firefighters encountered challenges during the containment efforts. The absence of the wind from the west prevented the fire from reaching the city front, but low tide affected access to water sources, complicating the overall firefighting operation.

 Contributions of Russian sailors 
The Russian sailors played a crucial role in assisting firefighting efforts. On the morning of October 23, 1863, when a large fire broke out, Admiral Popov ordered his squadron to aid the San Francisco fire service. Russian sailors displayed courage and valor in battling the fire. Despite initial use of buckets, they later transitioned to fire engines, working tirelessly alongside the San Francisco fire department. Their contributions were acknowledged by Chief Engineer Scannell and the Fire Department, expressing sincere gratitude.

Many sailors suffered serious injuries, and six Russian sailors lost their lives in the struggle against the fire. The deceased sailors were buried at the Mare Island naval cemetery. The residents of San Francisco expressed gratitude by contributing funds to aid the wounded, and the City Council of San Francisco presented Admiral Popov with a letter of thanks.

 Legacy 
The San Francisco Fire of 1863 left a lasting impact on the city's history. The collaborative efforts of firefighters and Russian sailors highlighted the importance of community resilience in the face of calamities. The event underscored the necessity for ongoing fire prevention measures and disaster preparedness in urban areas.

In 1994, commemorating the 130th anniversary of the sailors' sacrifice, the Russian Consulate in San Francisco organized a memorial service and erected new monuments at the graves of the fallen Russian sailors.

On May 9, 2010, a memorial plaque was installed in San Francisco at The Embarcadero near Pier 7. The project received support from the San Francisco Port Commission. The inscription on the plaque reads: ""In memory of the selfless and courageous actions of the Russian Imperial Navy sailors while saving the lives of many city residents in suppressing the great fire in San Francisco on October 23, 1863.""

180,21930,75613957,9938,Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment,"Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (Group) Co., Ltd. (SMEE), is a semiconductor manufacturing equipment company based in Shanghai, China. The company is involved in the research, development, manufacture and sale of lithography scanners and inspection tools to the semiconductor manufacturing industry; it also provides support services to its customers.

 Company history 
SMEE was established in 2002 by He Rongming, a former vice president at Shanghai Electric. It was originally a lithography machine technology research project under the 863 Program. After a few years of research, SMEE rolled out the first domestically made lithography machine for commercial use. 

In December 2017, SMEE signed a contract with CSC Financial to prepare it to become a public company. During the process, SMEE acquired funding from investors such as China Everbright Limited. There was a change in the management team afterwards leading He to leave SMEE in early 2018. 

 Product history 
Prior to 2023, SMEE's most advanced product for manufacturing front-end semiconductor chips was the SSA600, which has a scanning resolution that is capable of fabricating 90 nm-class integrated circuit silicon chips. The SSA600 series machines has been described by observers as an immersion deep ultraviolet lithography tool which features an argon fluoride (ArF) excimer laser emitting coherent ultraviolet light at a wavelength of 193 nm.

 SSA800x (December 2023) 
In December 2023, western media reported that SMEE has completed the initial development of its new SSA800-10W immersion lithography machine which has a scanning resolution capable of fabricating 28 nm-process class chips. Instances of the new machine may have been delivered to manufacturers such as SMIC and to research institutes. SSA800 continues to use ArF laser as its light source but also includes better tools and components which enable manufacturers to fashion circuit features associated with 28 nm-process technology. Western media reported that SSA800 is designed so that none of its components include intellectual properties that originate in the United States . Some analysts suggest that it is likely the Chinese government had asked SMEE to benchmark its new 28 nm-capable DUV immersion system against the similar ASML NXT:2000i system and that SSA800 is part of a fully domestic production line which is currently undergoing test production and certification. As of early 2024, SMEE's website does not yet include the new SSA800 lithography machine in its product list section.

In the future, a version of the SSA800 may be employed on processes below the 28 nm node via multi-patterning; generally, photolithography techniques developed in the field of multiple patterning allow immersion lithography machines using an ArF laser light source to fashion integrated circuits features associated with technologies as advanced as 7 nm or even 5 nm processes. For example, in 2016, media reports implied that Intel's then new 10 nm-process employed immersion DUV machines in combination with self-aligned double patterning techniques to achieve the desired circuit feature size, rather than using the latest EUV photolithography technology.

SMEE's SSA800 machine lags photolithography industry leader ASML Holding in time: ASML first delivered 28 nm-capable machines to TSMC in 2011.

 Pre-2023 product mix 
Prior to the introduction of the SSA800 scanner series in 2023, SMEE had developed a range of lithography, metrology, and derivative equipment, including four series of machines for the manufacture of front-end integrated circuits (such as the SSA600 series scanners), back-end IC packaging, LEDs, MEMS, IC power devices, and TFTs.

 EUV lithography 
In 2024, SMEE filed a patent for an EUV lithography scanner to manufacture advanced chips, which is currently only produced by Netherland's ASML; some observers suggest that there may be up to three separate current efforts within China, involving private, state, and educational institutions other than SMEE, to develop and deliver a prototype Chinese EUV lithography scanner in the next few years. The key driver in the development of advanced Chinese lithography equipment appears to be a government-backed effort to strengthen public-private collaboration in order to enhance innovation; in particular, the state seeks to overcome developmental bottlenecks by easing the transfer of advanced state-backed R&D to designated private-sector companies such as SMEE.

 United States sanctions 
In December 2022, as part of the United States' effort to impede Chinese development of advanced semiconductor equipment, the United States Department of Commerce added SMEE to the Bureau of Industry and Security's Entity List.",2025-04-19,"['Semiconductor companies of China' 'Companies based in Shanghai'

184,48786,76389796,14928,Shipment (Call of Duty),"""Shipment"" is a multiplayer map in the Call of Duty series of first-person shooter video games published by Activision. Originally set in a shipping yard outside of Chernobyl, the maps design is a small, compact square with numerous shipping containers inside, some of which the player can traverse through. This creates a design consisting of an intersection, and no other elements are present beyond this basic layout. As a result of its small design, the map is notorious for fast paced combat, as well as being a popular place for players to have duels.  

The map was first introduced in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (2007), where it was designed by that game's multiplayer design director as a developer test map. During development, the map was accidentally placed into the game's main multiplayer map selection, with its creator since referring to the map as an accident. ""Shipment"" has subsequently appeared in numerous other games in the Call of Duty series, with some versions making minor layout differences or changing the setting. ""Shipment"" has been met with a mostly positive response from critics, with praise towards its fast-paced action and simple layout, though others have criticized it for the same reasons. It has been considered one of the most iconic maps in the Call of Duty series, as well as one of its best.

 Design 

""Shipment"" is a multiplayer map originating from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (2007), a first-person shooter game developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision. The map takes place in a shipping yard near Chernobyl, Ukraine. The map's design is extremely small and simple, with the layout being a basic square with four smaller squares made of shipping containers inside it, creating an intersection. Extra angled shipping containers that the player can traverse through and take cover in are leaned up against each wall. No other elements are featured in the map, though later versions of the map do allow for some vertical movement. Players can typically get from one side of the map to the other in a mere ten seconds. Due to its small size and simplicity, fighting on the map is often extremely frantic. With no cover provided to the player beyond the containers, players could be killed immediately upon spawning, an act known as ""spawn-killing"". The map's frantic pace has made it an ideal location for players to have duels, or ""1v1s"".

The map was created by Geoffrey Smith, the multiplayer design director of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. Prior to becoming the game's multiplayer designer, Smith created custom maps for Counter Strike 1.6 under the username ""compoSITe"". ""Shipment"" has been noted to share numerous similarities with ""fy_iceworld"", a famous map in the game's community. Due to Smith repurposing his own Counter-Strike maps for Call of Duty titles, it's possible that ""Shipment"" was directly based on ""fy_iceworld"". The map was originally designed to be played exclusively  in a split-screen setting.

 History 
""Shipment"" first appeared in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare as one of sixteen different multiplayer maps included at the game's launch. According to Smith, the map was never intended to be included in the game's official release, and was instead meant to serve as an internal testing map. During development, the map was somehow added to the main multiplayer map selection, a mistake that wasn't noticed until the game had already shipped. Smith has since referred to the map as an accident, as well as the ""bane of [his] existence."" The map appeared in the game's 2016 remaster, and was intended to be a part of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009), though was scrapped before release. 

""Shipment"" reappears in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019), the reboot of the original game from 2007. The map was added after the games' launch, with this version taking place in London instead of Chernobyl. This version of the map also made minor design adjustments to prevent ""spawn-killing"", as well as introducing more verticality. The map has since appeared in the other games in the rebooted Modern Warfare sub-series, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II (2022) and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III (2023). The iteration featured in Modern Warfare II moved settings again, this time taking place on a container ship. The map has also been used in April Fools jokes by Infinity Ward, mainly with ""Shipment 10v10"" in 2020, which later got re-added to the game as a non-April Fools mode.

Other Call of Duty games have included maps based on ""Shipment"", though have given it different names, changed the setting, or changed the layout. These versions are ""Container"" in Call of Duty: Black Ops: Declassified (2012), ""Showtime"" in Call of Duty: Ghosts (2013), ""Shipment 1944"" in Call of Duty: WWII (2017), as well as a version in Call of Duty: Vanguard (2021).

 Reception 
""Shipment"" has been frequently referred to as one of the most popular maps in the Call of Duty series, as well as one of its most iconic. Kotaku'''s Alyssa Mercante wrote that ""Shipment"" was one of the two most iconic maps in the series, with the other one being ""Nuketown"" from the Black Ops sub-series. Several outlets have considered ""Shipment"" to be one of the best maps in the Call of Duty series due to its fast-paced nature. 

Writing on the original version of ""Shipment"", Mercante wrote that the map could ""push you over the edge"" due to its frantic nature of combat, which was further described as ""chaotic."" Toby Saunders and Cian Maher of GameRevolution said that ""Shipment"" was ""an experience that is unparalleled in first-person shooters to this day"", and one where players typically relied on ""luck of the draw"" for survival due to spawn-killing; GameRants Emma Majoros and Jake Fillery echoed similar thoughts. PC Worlds Brad Chacos praised the map's inclusion in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, describing the map as making up for the issues present within the game. Similarly to other writers, he highlighted the maps fast paced combat, which he viewed as allowing him to work around the games weapon upgrade system, which he saw as being flawed.  PC Gamers Morgan Park referred to the map as the worst map in video game history, commenting that the reasons people loved it were simultaneously its biggest flaws. He wrote that the map ""makes zero sense on paper"" based on its layout and lack of cover provided to players, describing the map as more of a meme or a tool to level up than a respected map amongst the community. Park also viewed the map as summarizing the points people critical of the Call of Duty'' series espouse against it, describing it as a ""brainless, low-effort meat grinder"" when compared to other maps in the series that were also small, such as ""Shoothouse"" and ""Nuketown."" Unlike those two, Park viewed ""Shipment"" as being ""mind-numbing.""",2024-11-04,['Multiplayer maps' 'Call of Duty levels'],"['first-person shooter' 'Activision' 'Chernobyl' 'Infinity Ward'

186,55229,76555693,14462,Jean Dugain,"Jean Dugain (23 February 1717 – died after 1787) was one of the most famous slave catchers active on Réunion during the 18th century, when it was still a French colony in the Indian Ocean known as Bourbon Island. In this capacity, he traversed many of the territories of the Highlands that had remained unexplored until then, and became a reference in the field for the island's authorities, who did not hesitate to call on him for reconnaissance missions.

He was the first white man to witness a volcanic eruption of the Piton de la Fournaise, overlooking the Enclos Fouqué, the last caldera formed by this active volcano. He may also have been the first settler to reach the summit of Piton des Neiges (Snow Peak), the island's highest mountain, or at least to visit it regularly.

He had a son named after him, lived as a hermit for 13 years in remote parts of the colony, and helped the travelling explorer Jean-Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent during his ascent to its highest point in the early 19th century. Their name has been given to several natural features in Réunion's geography, including a small piton in Plaine des Cafres, Piton Dugain, and an inhabited place in Sainte-Suzanne, as well as a cave that is difficult to access and a stream that has now disappeared from maps.

Early life
Jean Dugain was born on 23 February 1717 in Saint-Denis de La Réunion from the marriage of François Dugain and Ignace Clain, which took place on 12 April 1714 in the same town. He had at least one elder brother, bearing their father's first name, born of the same marriage on 9 March 1715 in Saint-Denis.

His father, born on 14 January 1695 in Sainte-Marie, was himself the son of Gilles Duguin and Cécile Mousse, married on 29 June 1687 in Saint-Paul. The former was a bricklayer born in Saint-Malo, Brittany, on 9 November 1661, and was therefore responsible for Jean Dugain's paternal family settling in the colony. The second, his wife, was born around 1674 to two parents originally from Madagascar, both slaves of the French East India Company. As such, Jean Dugain is the great-grandson of people who were enslaved by the institution he later served, purging the island of its maroons with the support of its authorities.

His mother, Ignace Clain, was born on 12 October 1694 in Saint-Paul daughter of a Bourbonnaise woman and a Jean Sekeling Clain, originally from Amsterdam in the Netherlands. She gave her husband several children, named Catherine, Anne, Louise, Pierre, Jacques, Marie, Mathurin, Suzanne and Marie. The latter, brothers and sisters of Jean Dugain, were born respectively in 1719, 1721, 1723, 1725, 1727, 1730, 1732, 1734 and 1736. Several of them were baptized in Sainte-Suzanne from the time of little Anne onwards, suggesting that the family had moved there from 1719 or 1725 onwards.

Slave catcher activities

Jean Dugain's career as a professional slave bounty hunter began a few years after the beginning of a movement to tighten local regulations concerning runaway slaves, the maroons who disappeared in the highlands of the island, i.e. off the coast in the mountains. After an amnesty had been promised to fugitives who surrendered in 1719, the Bourbon High Council ordered in 1725 that any blacks who refused to surrender to the authorities should be killed, and a ""merciless manhunt"" was launched. The following year, the same council promised thirty pounds for any slave, dead or alive. Finally, in 1729, regulations were drawn up for the detachments fighting the maroons. From then on, these detachments became professionalized, and Jean Dugain found himself at the head of one of them, along with François Mussard and François Caron, the latter being the only one of the three from the first generation of settlers.

Jean Dugain married Louise Lebeau on 20 November 1742 in Saint-Benoît, then lost his mother five months later, when she died at the age of 48 in Saint-Denis on 17 April 1743. His sister Louise followed suit in Sainte-Suzanne on 5 January 1748, as did his brother Pierre, who became one of the Volontaires de Bourbon on 19 March 1755 in Mazulipatam, India. During these years, Jean Dugain continued his slave-hunting activities, which led him to discover and destroy their many precarious constructions in the forests of Bourbon, as evidenced by his report of 24 August 1758: it states that he discovered a camp in the Pays brûlé at a place called ""les deux bras"" and 200 gaulettes (unit of measurement) from a site where fugitives were making a longboat  long, 12 wide and six high. He had the same kind of encounter during a stay in the woods from 10 to 25 May 1762, when he discovered ""a shed"" at Les Trois Salazes, a second camp at a place called l'Étang and a third ""in an extremely deep spot"" near Rivière des Marsouins.

For the rest, he captured several fugitives, including an individual who had come on a makeshift boat from the island of France, now Mauritius, and reported to the authorities on 28 June 1758 that he was ready to return him to his owner if he claimed him. He also killed several marrons, including a woman in the woods, for which he was promised a slave as a reward – this promise was formally established on 27 August 1757 at the expense of the commune of Sainte-Suzanne. According to a report he drew up on 3 June 1758, one day he learned from a certain Mac the exact location of a cave in the upper part of the Rivière des Remparts where fugitives were to be found, but the slaves' dogs alerted them in time and enabled them to disappear through the second exit of their lair before he burst in by surprise.

Explorer activities

In the mid-18th century, there was no path to the Piton de la Fournaise, and curious visitors had to improvise, starting from the Plaine des Cafres or up the Rivière Langevin, only to come up against a mountain rampart over a hundred meters high overlooking the latest caldera, known today as the Rempart de Bellecombe. It was against this backdrop that Jean Dugain was the first to observe the interior of the Enclos Fouqué during a volcanic eruption of the Piton de la Fournaise, an ""admirable and terrible spectacle"", in 1753.

Arriving at the Rempart de Bellecombe at the head of a detachment of fifteen Creoles sent there by the Governor of Bourbon, Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier, who had been alerted by the unprecedented effects of this exceptional eruption on the whole island, Jean Dugain observed the lava flowing at several points in the caldera and witnessed the formation of the small volcanic cone now known as Formica Leo.

A few years later, in October 1768, on the strength of his experience, he acted as route leader for a scientific expedition that included Joseph Hubert, a scientist, and Honoré de Crémont, the Bourbon governor himself. In his travel account, Crémont describes him as a Creole inhabitant of the Saint-Benoît district ""known on this island for his frequent and perilous hunts against the Black Maroons"", which testifies to a certain notoriety during his lifetime.

Descendants and posterity

The bounty hunter had a son with the same first name, and it is this man that Jean-Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent refers to as Jean Duguin, spelled with a 'U' in his 1804 account of his sojourns on Tenerife, the Isle de France (Mauritius), Réunion Island and Saint Helena, titled . With him and several other walkers, he made a perilous ascent of the Piton des Neiges, the island's highest peak. In fact, according to the traveler's own account, he was also a hunter, and ""perfectly familiar with the less-frequented places"", having lived alone for thirteen years in remote parts of the island, ""living, like a chestnut, far from the habitation of men"", which had indeed made him ""almost savage"". Jean-Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent adds that ""this very dark, lean and fierce-looking Creole had a particular expression of frankness in his eyes, to which his eyebrows, beard and white hair added an air of nobility"".

After a three-hour walk, and before reaching the coteau Maigre, the little group crossed a cavernous ravine on whose slopes was a cave that Jean-Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent describes as ""quite lodgable"", before adding that it was named in honor of his companion's father, ""an intrepid hunter, who lodged there during the runs he first made on this part of the island's interior"". This phrase implies that Jean Dugain senior was the first white man to visit the highest peak of the Piton des Neiges massif, a peak that Jean-Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent himself reached only after a great deal of fear and after having sent Jean Dugain junior on a scouting expedition in search of the present-day Dufour cave and its surrounding caves.

In addition to the cave, now forgotten, the name of the bounty hunter and his son was also given to a small peak on the Plaine des Cafres plateau, Piton Dugain, which houses an oratory and two water reservoirs and rises to an altitude of 1,755 meters to the east of Bourg-Murat. Their name is also used to designate an inhabited area in the Hauts of the Sainte-Suzanne commune, the Dugain forest, at 640 meters above sea level. Finally, according to contemporary Reunion historian Prosper Ève, there was a watercourse called Rivière Dugain on old maps of the island before the one published in 1825. Today, several centuries after his death in 1787, Jean Dugain senior remains the most famous hunter in Réunion's history, along with François Mussard. who was more active in the south, while he was more active in the north.",2025-02-23,"['1717 births' 'Year of birth uncertain' '18th-century French people'

189,24094,75673719,97293,2024 Bristol City Council election,"The 2024 Bristol City Council election was held on Thursday 2 May 2024, alongside the other local elections in the United Kingdom. It elected all 70 councillors to the Bristol City Council for a four-year term.

Until this election the council was led by the directly-elected Mayor of Bristol; that post was abolished following a 2022 referendum which saw 59% of voters in favour of replacing the mayoral system with a committee system. Prior to the election the council was under no overall control. The Green Party were the largest party, but the mayoralty was held by Marvin Rees of the Labour Party and all the cabinet positions were held by Labour.

Following the election the council remained under no overall control. The Greens remained the largest party and increased their number of seats, but fell two seats short of winning an overall majority. At the subsequent annual council meeting on 21 May 2024, Green councillor Tony Dyer was appointed to the re-established position of leader of the council (which had been abolished on the creation of the directly elected mayoralty in 2012). Policy committee chair positions were shared amongst the Greens and Liberal Democrats.

 Background 
Following the previous election, which was held in 2021, the council was in no overall control, though was run by the Mayor Marvin Rees and an all Labour cabinet. In the intervening 3 years, four by-elections occurred, seeing the Green Party gain one seat from the Liberal Democrats with no other change to the political makeup of the council.

190,3705,75087301,3071,Pathobiont,"A pathobiont is an organism that is native to the host's microbiome that under certain environmental or genetic changes can become pathogenic and induce disease.

Pathobionts differ from opportunistic pathogens in the sense that they are normally native to the microbiome, where opportunistic pathogens are acquired from outside that microbiome.

 Etymology 
The term was originally coined in 2008 by Sarkis Mazmanian to describe Helicobacter hepaticus and its ability to cause colitis under certain environmental conditions.

The term pathobiont had mixed reception among the microbiology field. The main argument against using the term is that some bacteria labelled as pathobionts also exhibit beneficial effects to hosts under normal conditions. The notion that their pathogenesis is tied to environmental or genetic changes from a perceived normal state would point to a firm understanding of a normal gut microbiome, which can vary drastically. Arguers against the term state all bacteria have metabolism that are environmentally dependent, and even symbionts have been shown to exhibit deleterious clinical effects under certain conditions. The argument has led to the development of a proposed term, pathogenic potential, to describe a microbe's ability to cause disease. Both terms are currently used within the field.",2025-02-20,['Microbiomes' 'Pathogenic bacteria' 'Pathogenic microbes'],"['opportunistic pathogens' 'microbiome' 'Sarkis Mazmanian'

193,19463,75537659,5561,Quantitative remote sensing,"Quantitative remote sensing is a branch of remote sensing. The quantitative remote sensing system does not directly measure land surface parameters of interest. Instead, the signature remote sensors receive is electromagnetic radiation reflected, scattered, and emitted from both the surface and the atmosphere.  Both modeling and model-based inversion are important for quantitative remote sensing. Here, modeling mainly refers to data modeling, which is a method used to define and analyze data requirements; model-based inversion mainly refers to using physical or empirically physical models to infer unknown but interested parameters.

 Model-based inversion 
The inversion algorithm is needed to obtain land surface parameters from remotely sensed data. It is not a trivia task to reliably retrieve land surface parameters since the remote sensing signature is a function of not only the variable of interest but also many other atmosphere and surface characteristics. Multifaceted aspects of the remote sensing data, such as the temporal, spectral, spatial, polarized information, as well as ancillary and prior knowledge, are typically used in a synthetic way to improve the quality of land parameter retrievals. Hundreds of models related to atmosphere, vegetation, and radiation have been established during past decades. The model-based inversion in geophysical (atmospheric) sciences has been well understood. However, the model-based inverse problems for Earth surface received much attention by scientists only in recent years. Compared to modeling, model-based inversion is still in the stage of exploration. This is because that intrinsic difficulties exist in the application of a priori information, inverse strategy, and inverse algorithm. The appearance of hyperspectral and multiangular remote sensor enhanced the exploration means, and provided us more spectral and spatial dimension information than before. However, how to utilize these information to solve the problems faced in quantitative remote sensing to make remote sensing really enter the time of quantification is still an arduous and urgent task for remote sensing scientists.

 Quantitative Models in Optical Remote Sensing 
All models in optical remote sensing are traditionally grouped into two major categories:

Statistical models: based on correlation relationships of land surface variables and remotely sensed data. They are easy to develop and effective for summarizing local data; however, the developed models are usually site-specific. They also cannot account for cause-effect relationships.

Physical Models: physically based models follow the physical laws of the remote sensing system. They also establish cause and effect relationships. If the initial models do not perform well, we know where to improve by incorporating the latest knowledge and information. However, there is a long curve to develop and learn these physical models. Any models represent the abstract of the reality; thus a realistic model could potentially be very complcx with a large number of variables.

The Battalion is part of the 5th Carabinieri Regiment ""Emilia-Romagna"".

 History 
The 6th Carabinieri Battalion ""Toscana"" tracks its origins back to the establishment of dedicated riot control units after World War I.

 1920 - 1923 
The Battalion was established on 2 May 1920 as the Mobile Carabinieri Battalion of Florence.

By force of the Royal Decree of 20 April 1920, no. 451, the Mobile Carabinieri Battalion of Florence was established among eighteen Autonomous Mobile Battalions.pp. 279–280

The Mobile Carabinieri Battalion of Florence was organized on:
 3 Carabinieri on foot companies;
 1 Cyclist Carabinieri Company;
 1 Machine-guns Section (2 Sections for seven Mobile Battalions: Torino 1°, Milano 1°, Firenze, Roma 1°, Roma 2°, Roma 3°, Palermo).p. 24

The Florence Mobile Battalion was disbanded by royal decree on 30 December 1923.

 1940 - 2001 
On 10 December 1940, following Italy's entry into the war, the VI mobilised Carabinieri Battalion was formed and operated on the Greek-Albanian front until 8 September 1943.

In 1940 the new Army organization foresaw four Carabinieri Battalions, while on 3 January 1944 12 Battalions (renamed Mobile Battalions) were re-established,p. 232 in order to deal with the civil unrest following the end of the civil war, along with four Mobile Battalions Groups.

The 1944-established Mobile Battalions were equipped, supplied and maintained by the relevant Carabinieri Legion. The Mobile Battalions Groups were: The Florence Mobile Battalion was grouped under the 2nd Group, headquartered in Florence, and subordinated to the 2nd Carabinieri Division ""Podgora"".

The Mobile Battalions were provided of new vehicles in order to enable them to deploy rapidly.

On 6 September 1945 the Battalion was reconstituted with its original name and on 30 March 1963 it was placed under the control of the 2nd Carabinieri Regiment of Rome.

On 1 September 1977, placed under the 11th Carabinieri Brigade, with corps command functions, it assumed its current name of 6th Carabinieri Battalion ""Toscana"". On 21 December 1977, the Battalion received the War Flag, granted by presidential decree 7 October 1977 n. 861.

On 2 May 2000 the Battalion celebrated the 80th anniversary of its establishment on the occasion of which a commemorative postcard and a commemorative philatelic postmark were created.

 2001 - present 
On 1 October 2007 the Battalion, following the assignment of an officer of the administration specialty, was reconfigured from a minor detachment to an ordinary detachment, consequently acquiring full administrative-financial autonomy.

In September 2012 the Battalion was transferred under the control of the newly established 5th Carabinieri Regiment ""Emilia-Romagna"".

 List of commanders 

 Mission 
The 6th Carabinieri Battalion ""Toscana"" is mandated to carry out: 
 the contribution to an integrated defense of the national territory;
 the participation in public order services during large demonstrations and events such as sporting events and concerts;
 surveillance of sensitive military sites and those of a civil nature determined, from time to time, by the public security authority;
 the preparation of assets to be used in expeditionary missions to carry out military police functions and support some logistical activities;
 the support of the territorial organization of the Carabinieri Legion ""Toscana"" (territorial organisation) to increase territorial control in large urban, extra-urban and rural areas in the most sensitive areas in terms of public safety as well as civil protection needs.

 Organisational structure 
The 6th Carabinieri Battalion ""Toscana"" is part of the 5th Carabinieri Regiment ""Emilia-Romagna"". In turn, the 5th Carabinieri Regiment operates under the 1st Carabinieri Mobile Brigade, which coordinates the use of mobile regiments.

The organizational structure of the 6th Battalion is as follows:
 Command and Services Squad
 Administration Section
 1st Operational Company
 Operational Intervention Company: support to territorial organisation
 Rescue Unit

 Operational Intervention Company 
The Operational Intervention Company is the unit of the Battalion that has the task of promptly dealing with sudden situations of danger to public security. The Operational Intervention Company deploys both Operational Intervention Squads (Squadre di Intervento Operativo, S.I.O.) and Operational Support Squads (Squadre Operative di Supporto, S.O.S.).

The Operational Intervention Squads are tasked to perform extraordinary control measures (such as round-ups, manhunt, etc.) in support to territorial units of the Carabinieri.

The Operational Support Squads are also part of the Operational Intervention Company, with special tasks to prevent and promptly counter terrorist or other armed threats.

 Rescue Unit

196,37687,76066151,4754,Death of a Swagman,"Death of a Swagman (1945) is a novel by Australian writer Arthur Upfield. It is the ninth of the author's novels to feature his recurring character Detective Inspector Napoleon 'Bony' Bonaparte. It was originally published in USA by Doubleday Books in 1945.

It was also serialised in weekly instalments in The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper from 20 November 1945 to 19 February 1946.

Abstract
Bony decides to investigate the death of a swagman in a small hut, near the fictitious town of Merino in NSW, after he notices something peculiar in the photograph taken of the scene.

Location
The action of the novel takes place at Walls of China now in Mungo National Park, north-east of Buronga, far south-western NSW.

Publishing history
Following the book's initial publication by Doubleday Books in 1945 it was subsequently published as follows:

 Francis Aldor, UK, 1946
 Angus & Robertson, Australia, 1947
 Signet, USA, 1948

and subsequent paperback, ebook and audio book editions.

Critical reception
Writing in The Courier-Mail Warwick Lawrence commented: ""Apart from its criminal plot, there is a feel of the loneliness of the outback in this book. Perhaps because of its local colour, murder or no murder, I enjoyed it for this very reason...Mr. Upfield knows his country and its people. His characters are true to type and alive — except for the corpse, for which I must forgive him.""

A. R. McElwain in the Melbourne Herald was not so taken with the work: "" Mr Upfield presents a pretty straight-forward plot involving the killing, in the first place, of a tramp. He works in neatly, as a valuable clue, one of those symbols swagmen make on gateposts to indicate to other swaggies how the land lies...But the murderer, I suggest, could have been landed in half the time with a little less Bony and a little more bustle by a couple of sound men from the Sydney CIB.""",2024-03-25,['1945 Australian novels' 'Novels by Arthur Upfield' '1945 books'],"['Arthur Upfield' ""Detective Inspector Napoleon 'Bony' Bonaparte""

At the time there was a cultural split between reform Jewry in Johannesburg and its counterpart in Cape Town, with the leadership in Cape Town rejecting a proposal for the creation of the position of Chief Minister under which all Progressive congregations would fall.

Super said that this was the conclusion he arrived at “after a thorough examination of the Halachic situation and the Halachic principles involved.” The agreement was welcomed by the Jewish establishment in the country, with the South African Jewish Board of Deputies describing it as “a very sensible and practical agreement.” However, within progressive Jewish circles it was regarded as a capitulation to Orthodoxy. Super was only representing Johannesburg's progressive congregations in the agreement. His counterpart in Cape Town, Rabbi David Sherman was opposed to the position taken by Super, stating that it amounted to “allowing ourselves to be read out of the community of Klal Yisrael."" In 1968, the Women's Zionist Council of SA (WIZO) published his booklet “Five Generations of Jewish Life - a Review of Jewish History since the Nineteenth Century”, made up of twelve lectures by Super.

Super retired in 1975 and made aliyah to Israel soon afterwards. In 1977 he was quoted by Chaim Herzog, future President of Israel in his concluding words to the Central Conference of American Rabbis in June of that year: It is not I who says this. This thesis was propounded by a well known colleague of yours Arthur Saul Super of Johannesburg. In an article only last week on this subject in the Jerusalem Post he stated: ""But the real fault lies with the proponents of Reform Judaism themselves.

202,14505,75390460,4922,Crewe Britannia F.C.,"Crewe Britannia Football Club was an English football club from Crewe in Cheshire.

History

The club was founded in 1873 as a rugby club, with regular matches against clubs such as Widnes  and Runcorn.

Before the start of the 1883–84 season, perhaps inspired by the example of Crewe Alexandra, the club switched to association football, and indeed had the assistance of some Alexandra players in some of its early matches, such as a 4–0 win at Whitchurch Alexandria in September 1883.

The only national competition the club entered was the 1885–86 Welsh Cup.  In the first round, the club beat Chester 3–0 in the first round (Chester handicapped by playing for 70 minutes with 10 men, due to an injury to Sissons), but lost 5–1 at Crewe Alexandra in the second, despite holding a half-time lead.

The club at this time could attract 600 spectators, and played a friendly at Newton Heath, but Britannia was never so ambitious again, and descended into more local football.  This may have been due to the ""depressed state of trade"" or that Alexandra could attract several thousand to its FA Cup ties. 

By its final seasons, the club had been reduced to playing in the Crewe Junior Cup, and in 1893–94 it lost at Audlem in the first round.  The final match recorded for the club was a 6–2 defeat against the Crewe Athletic reserve side in February 1894.

Colours

The club wore green and white.

Ground

The club's first ground was in Rockwood Lane.  By 1878 it had moved to a ground on Edleston Road, and it used the Imperial Hotel for its facilities.

Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as ""39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67"", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus ""41 Geo. 3"" rather than ""41 Geo. III""). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as ""41 Geo. 3"".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.

204,51837,76459399,45867,Cleon (Foundation),"Cleon, commonly referred to by the metonym Empire, is the name of multiple fictional characters in the 2021 Apple TV+ television series Foundation. They are the Genetic Dynasty of clones who rule the Galactic Empire. In the series, the 12,000-year-old Empire has been ruled for 400 years by a revolving trio of Cleon I clones: Brother Day, a Cleon in his prime; Brother Dusk, a retired and aging Cleon who serves in an advisory role; and Brother Dawn, a young Cleon being trained to succeed Brother Day. The series is an adaptation of the Foundation series of novels by Isaac Asimov, and stars Lee Pace as Day, Terrence Mann as Dusk, and Cassian Bilton as Dawn. Cloning does not factor in Asimov's novels, though emperors named Cleon I and Cleon II appear as supporting characters.

 Character 

 Casting and reception 
The trio of Cleon clones are portrayed by Lee Pace (Brother Day), Terrence Mann (Brother Dusk) and Cassian Bilton (Brother Dawn) in the 2021 Apple TV+ television series Foundation. Pace's casting was announced in October 2019, and the  casting of Mann and Bilton was announced in December 2019. Cooper Carter plays Brother Dawn as a child in season one.

Nick Allen of RogerEbert.com described Pace's performance as ""magnetic"", and Chancellor Agard of Entertainment Weekly called it a ""campy and playful turn"". Sean O'Neal of Texas Monthly called Pace's performance ""bombastic"", and wrote, ""Pace was simply born to play a tyrant. His Brother Day comes off like a cross between the Roman emperor Commodus and the Marquis de Sade, a narcissist with swept-back Bradley Cooper hair and a wicked smile that perpetually curls his lips. Pace imbues every line with aristocratic menace, all delivered in his stentorian, Shakespeare in the Park projection."" James Dyer of Empire: ""Pace brings both weight and humanity to the waning imperium ... while placing a consistent face on the empire at the story's heart."" Richard Edwards of Space.com wrote that Pace's performance has ""too many echoes of his stern turns"" in Guardians of the Galaxy and the Hobbit films. Early trailers for the series prompted online fans to refer to Pace as ""Intergalactic Emperor Daddy"". Chase Hutchinson of Collider wrote:

Daniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that ""The interplay between Mann and Pace as imperious rulers has strong theatrical energy."" Caroline Framke of Variety wrote that at times, ""Pace and Mann tap into a shared, visceral disdain that betrays more personality than their respective Cleons would likely care to admit exists."" Sean T. Collins of Decider described Mann's performance in ""The Last Empress"", in which Dusk experiences one shocking revelation after another, as ""fascinating to watch"", and wrote, ""Mann's command of the diverse emotions and affects called for here, making them seem like the product of a single unquiet mind, is deeply impressive."" Collins also described Bilton's Dawn as ""seemingly aroused equally by the gorgeous Sareth's unabashed come-ons and their secret rebellion against his older bro.""

Chaim Gartenberg of The Verge called the Genetic Dynasty ""the show's highlight, thanks in no small part to Pace's dynamic performances"". Agard explained, ""This curious political unit raises interesting questions about individuality and if progress is possible without fundamental change, and it's the main source of fun in the show.""

 Description 
In the 2021 television series adaptation Foundation, the 12,000-year-old Empire has been ruled for 400 years by a revolving triumvirate of Cleon I clones: Brother Day, a Cleon in his prime; Brother Dusk, a retired and aging Cleon who serves in an advisory role; and Brother Dawn, a young Cleon being trained to succeed Brother Day. Though cloning does not factor in Asimov's novels, the television series introduces a ""Genetic Dynasty"", surreptitiously administered for centuries by the regal Lady Demerzel, secretly a unique, ageless humanoid robot. The clones serve as ""the personification of the Empire's permanency, constant and unchanging, ever-present and never-failing."" In the story, the Imperial triad scoff at mathematician Hari Seldon's predictions of the Empire's imminent fall, and exile him from the capital world, Trantor, to the distant planet Terminus. But thanks to a devastating and unprecedented terrorist attack, their eyes are now opened to the signs that the Empire is indeed decaying.

In season one, Dawn conceals his color blindness, an anomaly among the Cleons, from Day and Dusk. He and Day also exhibit signs of unprecedented emotions, making them less detached and cruel than their predecessors, which Dusk believes will spell their doom. It is eventually revealed that the rebel movement has tampered with the Cleon genetics, facing the current Day with the fact that the bloodline is now tainted and he, his successors, and likely a number of his predecessors have irrevocably diverged from the original Cleon. Dusk insists that Dawn, who was easily manipulated by the rebels, be destroyed, but Day shows compassion. Demerzel, however, recognizes the danger that Dawn now poses to the dynasty, and kills him.

In season two, a subsequent Day decides to halt the degradation of the bloodline by marrying the newly crowned Queen Sareth of Cloud Dominion and fathering an heir with her. Displeased, Demerzel feigns acceptance, but schemes to prevent the marriage and be rid of Sareth. Demerzel is revealed to be the real power behind the Imperial throne, guiding humanity on a millennial scale. The genetically corrupted Cleons increasingly veer from the path she has set for them, and she begins to act more overtly autonomous, thwarting their choices and actions, and even killing and replacing them with new copies as necessary to preserve her grand scheme for humanity.

Series executive producer David S. Goyer invented the clone emperors, who are not in Asimov's novels, as a way of providing some continuity to a story that takes place over a thousand years. O'Neal explained, ""Pace's Brother Day is one of the few characters that we’re actually allowed to connect with"", and described the character as ""the smug embodiment of imperial hubris"". Pace said of the Emperors, ""On one side of their mind, they believe they're the same person. They actually believe this, and they believe that person is the Emperor of the galaxy ... And on the other side of that mind, are a series of individuals who, whether they like it or not, are individuals."" Daniel Bibby of Screen Rant called the conceit of the Genetic Dynasty ""a well-executed concept that allows for a centuries-long chess match between Empire and Hari Seldon."" Rafael Motamayor of IGN praised the idea of clone emperors as ""arguably the most fascinating addition to the show, which helps it stand out from the rest of the sci-fi landscape.""

 Storyline 

 Season 1 
In ""The Emperor's Peace"", Hari Seldon's predictions of the Galactic Empire's imminent fall, based on his science of psychohistory, are dismissed by Brothers Day, Dawn and Dusk, the trio of Emperor Cleon I clones who rule the Empire. Seldon is spared execution for treason after a devastating terrorist attack—the destruction of the Star Bridge, Trantor's space elevator—illustrates for Day that there is indeed decay within the Empire. Seldon and his followers are exiled to Terminus to establish the ""Foundation"", a repository of human knowledge that Seldon claims will shorten the dark age after the Empire's demise from thirty thousand years to a single millennium. In ""Preparing to Live"", the Empire investigates the Star Bridge attack but is unable to identify its mastermind, or conclusively attribute it to Seldon or the governments of Anacreon or Thespis. Despite Dusk urging that the detained delegations from the two kingdoms should be granted clemency, Day opts for a public execution of all delegates except the two ambassadors, simultaneous with orbital bombardments of their homeworlds. The Genetic Dynasty undertakes its next traditional transfer of power in ""The Mathematician's Ghost"": a new Dawn is decanted, the current Dawn is elevated to Day, the current Day retires as Dusk, and Dusk assumes the mantle of Brother Darkness before being euthanized.

In ""Barbarians at the Gate"", a charismatic religious leader, Zephyr Halima Ifa, revives an orthodox, pre-Imperial dogma that asserts clones do not possess souls. This religious issue and a violent insurrection in the lower levels of Trantor fulfill two key portents of the Empire's decline that Seldon related at his trial. Day grows frustrated with Dusk, feeling his elder seeded these problems decades ago by acting impulsively and refusing to heed Seldon's warnings. While Day departs Trantor to intervene with Ifa, Dusk sends a fleet to visit the Foundation, which has fallen silent. In ""Death and the Maiden"", Day attempts to undermine Ifa on the holy moon at the center of the Luminist faith, but she gains the upper hand with a galvanizing speech that subtly criticizes Imperial cloning. On Trantor, Dawn pursues a romance with Azura Odili, a palace gardener, and bares his deepest secret: he inexplicably has minor genetic traits, such as color blindness, that differentiate him from all previous Cleon clones. Day is agitated by his inability to rein in the defiant Ifa in ""Mysteries and Martyrs"", but decides he can upstage her by undertaking Luminism's most sacred pilgrimage. Azura asks Dawn, who lives in constant fear of being replaced by another clone should his uniqueness be exposed, to consider running away with her.

In ""The Missing Piece"", Day completes the Spiral, a torturous trek to a desert cave pool, and claims to have received a vision of a sacred flower. The Zephyrs interpret Day's vision as a divine pronouncement that he has a soul, rendering any further criticism of Imperial cloning by a Luminist to be sacrilege, and nullifying any threat from Ifa. Day seals his victory by commanding Demerzel, his devoutly Luminist robot majordomo, to covertly assassinate Ifa. Day reflects on his experience in the cave, revealing he had no vision at all. Dawn realizes Dusk knows his secret and escapes the palace in ""The First Crisis"". He discovers that Azura is part of a rebel conspiracy which plans to replace him with compliant duplicate. Dusk arrives with Imperial troops who dispatch the conspirators and their counterfeit Cleon. In ""The Leap"", Day tells Azura he has killed all of her relatives and everyone she has ever met, and that she will be shrouded for the rest of her life. Day decides to spare Dawn over Dusk's objections, but Demerzel sees the danger Dawn poses to the dynasty and kills him anyway, affirming that her loyalty to the Cleon dynasty supersedes Day's wishes. Day learns that the anti-Empire conspiracy has tainted the DNA of the entire Cleonic line, affecting all future generations.

 Season 2 
In the season two premiere ""In Seldon's Shadow"", a subsequent Day survives an assassination attempt while he is having sex with Demerzel, and suspects Dawn and Dusk's involvement. Day has decided to halt the degradation of the bloodline by marrying the newly crowned Queen Sareth of Cloud Dominion, and fathering an heir with her. Wary of Day in the aftermath of the deaths of her entire family, Sareth is not enthusiastic about the proposal. Dawn and Sareth form a connection in ""Where the Stars are Scattered Thinly"", and Dusk reconnects with his former lover, Sareth's advisor Rue Corintha. Dusk offers to show Rue recordings of their encounter, as her memories of the event were wiped per protocol. During a heated argument with Day, Sareth accepts his marriage proposal in ""The Sighted and the Seen"". Dusk is disturbed to learn that Day has the authority to conduct memory audits on him and Dawn. Dusk and Dawn's shared distrust of Day grows as they discover that the original Cleon has a much larger memory hoard than subsequent clones, including them.

In ""Why the Gods Made Wine"", Day introduces his bride-to-be to the people of Trantor, but Sareth upstages him, wins the crowd and leaves Day feeling unsettled. After Demerzel insinuates she was somehow involved in orchestrating the murders of Sareth's family, Sareth confronts Day in ""A Necessary Death"". She then proposes to Dawn that he impregnate her instead of Day. Day is unnerved by a Seldon avatar, and orders a blockade around Terminus. In ""The Last Empress"", Day decides to deal with the troublesome Foundation on Terminus in person, despite the protestations of Dusk and Demerzel. Dusk, prodded by Corintha, realizes that he has somehow been programmed not to question Demerzel's role or origins. Dusk and Corintha discover a secret chamber guarded by a projection of Cleon I. Dawn and Sareth consummate their relationship as they realize that Demerzel has been controlling the Empire all along.

In ""Long Ago, Not Far Away"", Dusk and Corintha learn Demerzel's backstory. Imprisoned for 5,000 years until rediscovered by young Cleon I, Demerzel spends his lifetime telling him stories of the Robot Wars and grooming him to eventually free her. Cleon finally does in his declining years, but ever wary, he implants a chip in her first that enslaves her to his millennia-long plan to rule the universe. He intends for Demerzel to be his immortal successor, with his clones as the face of the Empire, their development and actions subtly controlled by her. Now aware of Demerzel's true function, Dusk and Corintha are trapped in the chamber by Cleon I. On Terminus, Day rages at the revelation that the Foundation's propagandist Church of the Galactic Spirit has been providing forbidden technology to its allies. He stabs the Foundation director, orders the scientists captured alive and everyone else slaughtered. Day confronts Seldon's avatar, and threatens to destroy Terminus if Seldon will not admit his math is flawed. Day believes he is different than all the Cleons before him, and can change the future that Seldon has predicted. But Seldon ignores him and instead speaks to Demerzel. He understands her true role, and gifts her with his Prime Radiant and its psychohistorical equations so that she may use it to guarantee humanity's survival. Though General Bel Riose believes he can end the conflict without violence, Day orders Terminus to be destroyed. Demerzel laments her failures in raising him, and abruptly leaves him on the Imperial flagship and heads back to Trantor. Day grins as Terminus explodes.

Demerzel confronts the trapped Dusk and Corintha in the season two finale ""Creation Myths"". Dusk marks Demerzel's neck with green paint before Demerzel kills him and Corintha. Dawn recognizes the green mark as the sign of a traitor and flees Trantor with Sareth, who is pregnant with his child. Day is enraged by Riose's defiance of his order to destroy more Foundation-allied worlds, and the revelation that the Imperial fleet is in the process of complete destruction via sabotage. Day battles Riose in hand-to-hand combat, and uses a castling device to switch places with Day via teleportation, venting the Emperor into space and killing him. On Trantor, Demerzel decants three new Cleon clones, and activates the Prime Radiant.

 Literary origins 
Introduced in the novella ""Dead Hand"", published in the April 1945 issue of Astounding Science Fiction, Cleon II is the last great Emperor of the Galactic Empire. Threatened by the rising power and popularity of Bel Riose, one of his own generals, Cleon has him recalled and executed for treason. Josh Wimmer and Alasdair Wilkins of Gizmodo described Cleon II as ""the aging, infirmed emperor whose great mind has been let down by his faltering body."" Nicholas David Gevers suggested that Cleon II is based on the Byzantine emperor Justinian I. Cleon II is voiced by William Fox in episode four ""The General"" of the 1973 BBC Radio 4 adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.

In the prequel novel Prelude to Foundation (1988), Emperor Cleon I learns of mathematician Hari Seldon's nascent concept of psychohistory. Brought before Cleon, Seldon emphasizes his belief that developing it as a science is likely impossible. Subsequently, interest in Seldon's work by unknown parties puts him in danger, convincing him of psychohistory's potential importance. Wimmer and Wilkens described Cleon as ""basically decent but woefully inadequate"" but also ""a fairly entertaining character, who has me absolutely convinced that ruling a whole galaxy could be just a drag if you were born at the wrong time"".

In Forward the Foundation (1993), Seldon and his foster son Raych thwart the scheme of populist Jo-Jo Joranum to become Cleon's First Minister and then overthrow him. The emperor subsequently appoints Seldon as his First Minister. Joranum's associate Gambol Deen Namarti's own plan to assassinate Seldon using a drugged Raych is also foiled, but Cleon is killed by a gardener trying to avoid promotion. A military government subsequently takes over, lasting for a decade.",2024-12-12,"['Fictional clones' 'Foundation universe characters' 'Galactic emperors'

The game is a licensed platformer depicting the Looney Tunes animated cartoon character Speedy Gonzales, who the player controls across six stages set in Mexico. Upon release, Speedy Gonzales received average to mixed reviews, with critics praising the visual presentation of the game but faulting its platform gameplay mechanics, difficulty, and performance. 

Gameplay

 

Playing as Speedy Gonzales, players must navigate platform levels to rescue mice and collect cheese taken by Sylvester the Cat. The game proceeds through eighteen stages set in six levels across Mexico, including a Mexican city and temple, and stages based around obstacles that include wind, water, fire, and jaguars. Players collect and use several weapons to defeat enemies, including a boomerang, smoke bomb, cheese balls that bounce through the level, and rolling fire. Players have four lives, with bonus lives collected throughout stages. The game features a password system upon the completion of levels to return to stages.

Reception

Aztec Adventure received average to mixed reviews upon release. Describing the game as ""one of the best-looking Looney Tunes games on the platform, Total Game Boy praised the game's sense of speed and compared it to the Sonic The Hedgehog series of video games. Alec Matias of IGN commended the game's ""beautiful backgrounds and intricate level designs"" and ""well-animated"" characters, but found the game to have an ""abundance of minor flaws"", citing the game's ""faulty design"", difficulty, lack of lives, inability to render multiple enemies on a screen without slowdown, and ""annoying"" music. Frank Dry of Hyper similarly praised the animations and ""lush"" backgrounds, but expressed annoyance with the game's difficulty, fast-paced puzzles, and level design. Jon Thompson of Allgame found the game to be ""visually enticing"" and ""nicely detailed"", but also found the game to be ""extremely challenging"" due to its hard boss fights, difficult controls, precise platforming, limited lives and poor performance.",2025-01-30,"['2000 video games' 'Game Boy Color games' 'Game Boy Color-only games'

209,19317,75535179,9091,Jinnahbhai Poonja,"Jinnahbhai Poonja (c. 1857 – 15 April 1902) was a Khoja Gujarati merchant in British India. He was founder and chairman of Jinnahbhai & Co. and Graham's Shipping and Trading Company. He is best known for being the father of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder and first Governor-General of Pakistan, and Fatima Jinnah.

 Biography 
Jinnahbhai Poonja was born in Paneli Moti, Gujarat, to Poonja Gokuldas Meghji (who was born a Hindu, later converted to Islam, and was the son of a Lohana Hindu Merchant). The family belonged to a Gujarati-speaking community of Lohana caste. Jinnahbhai had two brothers, Valji and Nathoo, and one sister, Manbai. Throughout his life Poonja was a prosperous merchant and businessman who brought his family up in a wealthy lifestyle. Jinnahbhai married Mitthibhai Jinnah in 1874. Poonja started Jinnahbhai & Co., a wealthy merchant company that operated out of Karachi. Due to his partnership with Graham's Shipping and Trading Company, Poonja moved to Karachi, where its headquarters operated. Karachi was an optimal place at the time due to the opening of the Suez Canal, meaning Karachi was closer to Europe, making it a much more popular port than before. Poonja rented the Wazir Mansion for his family, and this is where his children, most notably Muhammad Ali Jinnah was born. In 1900, Poonja returned to Gujarat, where he died in 1901.

 Upbringing and business 
Most of Paneli Moti were agriculturalists; however, Poonja's family managed handlooms instead. Poonja's brothers worked on the handlooms alongside their father, but this way of life did not attract Poonja, who wanted to be a businessman. Poonja left for Gondal, where he started his business with much success. In her book, ""My Brother"", Fatima Jinnah stated about her father,

In 1874, Poonja married Mitthibhai, a fellow Khoja, and they eventually had 7 children: Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Ahmed Ali Jinnah and Bunde Ali Jinnah, Rahmat Bai Jinnah, Shireen Bai Jinnah, Maryam Bai Jinnah, and Fatima Jinnah.

 Raising his children 
Unlike his ancestors who were originally Hindu, Poonja raised his children in a more Islamic way, abandoning many Hindu traditions and customs his family had previously practiced. In 1886, Poonja got his son Mahomedali admitted into the Sindh Madrasa, before also having him attend the Anjuman-e-Islam School in Bombay. Poonja eventually sent Mahomedali to England after getting offered an apprenticeship by Sir Frederick Leigh Croft to work for his firm, Graham's Shipping and Trading Company. It was needed for Mahomedali to go to England because there was a legal proceeding against  Poonja, which placed the family's property at risk of being sequestered.

 Legal Issues 
By the time Mahomedali went to England, Poonja's wife Mithibai and Mahomedali’s wife, Emibai Jinnah, both died. Poonja was in debt and owed money to numerous businesses and was faced with numerous legal battles. Fatima Jinnah stated, 

With his life in Karachi falling apart, Poonja moved his family to Bombay in 1893, where Mahomedali began to take care of his family's expenses instead of Poonja.

 Death 
Poonja died on 15 April 1902, leaving behind 7 children. Mahomedali, now legally renamed to Muhammad Ali, would move to Bombay as a barrister and to support his family. Muhammad Ali Jinnah would go on to be one of the most notable Indian and later Pakistani political leaders of the 20th century.",2025-03-29,"['Jinnah family' '19th-century Indian businesspeople' '1857 births'

210,14217,75385749,11235,2023 Chinese pneumonia outbreak,"In November 2023, China's health authorities reported an outbreak of respiratory illnesses in several parts of northern China. As hospitals became overwhelmed in Beijing and Liaoning, the World Health Organization (WHO) requested detailed information from China regarding the surges in respiratory health, while advising the community to take important precautions. China complied, responding that ""no unusual or novel pathogens were found"" in the provided data.

, the cause of the outbreak is unknown. Possible reasons include known seasonal diseases and the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions.

Timeline
May–October 2023
As reported in China Daily, an increase of mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in China was observed in May 2023 by Zhou Huixia, director of a children's medical centre, with a ""rapid increase"" in August and a ""particularly ferocious"" wave starting in early October. On 24 October 2023, Zhou predicted that the wave would peak in November.

November 2023
On 13 November, authorities from China's National Health Commission reported an increase in respiratory diseases. The increase in these diseases was attributed to the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions earlier in the year, and the circulation of known pathogens including influenza, mycoplasma pneumoniae (a common bacterial infection typically affecting young children), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2.

On 21 November, ProMED reported clusters of undiagnosed pneumonia in children in northern China. It is unclear if these are associated with the overall increase in respiratory infections previously reported by Chinese authorities or separate events. Further information about recent trends in these known pathogens was requested by the WHO. The WHO stated that during October and November, northern China had reported an ""increase in influenza-like illness"" compared to the corresponding period during the previous three years.

On 23 November, Chinese health authorities claimed that the increase in respiratory diseases was not attributed to any novel or unknown pathogens but was relevant to known pathogens. Later, WHO verifies that no novel or unknown pathogens have been discovered so far, and the clinical features of the diseases are not unusual.

On 27 November, a journal article published in Nature indicated that there are many multiple anomalies behind the dramatic increase in respiratory disease cases in China. First, usually, the infection caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae is easy to treat, but, in this case in China, the infection causes serious impact on Chinese children. Second, after the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, cases reported by some of the countries are virus infections; in contrast, the major cases reported by China, particularly, are mycoplasma pneumoniae, a disease whose infection is caused by bacteria.

Other pneumonia outbreaks in late 2023

In late November 2023, Russian children's hospitals and infectious diseases hospitals in Moscow and St. Petersburg noticed a significant increase of mycoplasma pneumonia in patients with acute respiratory infections. The outbreak will likely complicate already expected epidemics such as those caused by the coronavirus, influenza A and respiratory syncytial viruses. As of December, large queues of ambulances have been reported to have formed in front of Infectious Diseases Hospitals No. 1 and No. 2 in Moscow.

A similar outbreak occurred in Ohio in the United States in late 2023. As of December 2023, Céline Gounder, an infectious disease specialist stated that the outbreaks were similar but unrelated.

Denmark reported an pneumonia outbreak. As of November 2023, 541 cases had been identified.

Journalism
Gambotto-Burke was first published in The Australian at the age of eighteen.

After moving to England in 1984, Gambotto-Burke worked for the music press in London - notably, the NME and Zig Zag. She won UK Cosmopolitan magazine's New Journalist of the Year Award in 1988. She also worked for The Independent on Sunday, notably a cover story on cardiothoracic surgeons.""Affairs of the Heart"" by Antonella Gambotto-Burke, The Independent on Sunday Review, 17 March 1991.

In 1989, Gambotto-Burke returned to Sydney, where she resumed working for The Australian as a senior feature profile writer and literary critic. She also began writing for The South China Morning Post, The Globe and Mail, Harper's Bazaar, Elle, Vogue and other major global publications. Channel Nine Entertainment Director Richard Wilkins said in an interview that, ""if you're on her wavelength, the interview is a most enjoyable experience. If not, it could be quite disconcerting. The key is to be open and honest with her.""'In the blood', by Murray Waldren, The Australian Magazine, 26–27 March 1994.

Of her journalism, author Matthew Condon wrote, ""Her razor eye for the architecture of pretension and her ability to record untidied dialogue, especially the way it can betray the human mind and soul, have made her an object of fear and derision. To have been 'Gambottoed' is to have had a vein opened.""""Another phrase of her life"" by Matthew Condon, The Age, 22 August 1998.

Gambotto-Burke's interviewees include Martin Amis, Elle Macpherson, Gérard Depardieu, Morrissey, Thierry Mugler, Marc Newson, Deepak Chopra, Flavio Briatore, Robert Smith, Erica Jong, Colleen McCullough, Jeffrey Archer, Princess Haya bint Al Hussein, Jerry Hall and Naomi Wolf.'Antonella Gambotto at The Sydney Institute' Retrieved 28 March 2023.

Her best known comic interview – with Warwick Capper,""The Blond Leading the Blond"" by Antonella Gambotto, Mode, 1994 a retired Australian rules footballer, and his wife – is included in The Best Australian Profiles (Black Inc., 2004). ""The best profiles lodge deep in the public mind, such as ... Antonella Gambotto's cheerfully dopey Warwick and Joanne Capper, which presaged by years the arrival of Kath & Kim"", Professor Matthew Ricketson wrote in 2005.""Close Up: Review"" by Matthew Ricketson, The Age, 18 June 2005.

“The Blonde leading the Blonde” (Gambotto-Burke's interview with the Cappers) was, as writer Richard Cooke reported, reprinted several times, ""and its descriptive passages – one of which described Joanne's pubic hair as 'white as the froth on a pint of Castlemaine' – became legend.""

In the interview with Cooke, Gambotto-Burke said, ""Warwick was voluble, enthusiastic, wild, mad, emotional, straightforward, carnal, intense, passionate, ambitious, unintelligent and hysterically funny, if not always intentionally. I loved his spirit if not his avidity, which I found disconcerting ... It was so shocking – I'm laughing here – but not because of the sexuality. The whole thing was shocking – the frankness, the spa bath, the chocolate-covered nuts (or raisins, or whatever they were). They were so artless. I felt as if I'd entered another universe.""'Tasteful Sexuality', by Richard Cooke, The Monthly, October 2019

In Undercover Agent, Murray Waldren noted that ""an interview with [Gambotto-Burke] often has the studied savagery of the corrida amid the crystal cruet ambience of high tea at the Ritz. Such ritualistic disembowelling, highly entertaining and in stark contrast to the asinine, PR-driven pap of most modern profiles, leave the gored stirred and very shaken.""'Dining Out with Mr. Lunch', by Murray Waldren, University of Queensland Press, 1999

Controversy
In London, Gambotto-Burke was employed as a music critic at the NME by editor Neil Spencer'Interview with legendary NME editors Neil Spencer and Mat Snow', Boogaloo Radio, 13 August 2019 and, on the advice of her live editor Mat Snow, wrote under pseudonyms Antonella Black and Ginger Meggs.Introduction, An Instinct for the Kill, by Antonella Gambotto, HarperCollins, 1997 Her review of Cliff Richard's concert, in which she referred to him as ""Satan"" and which made national newspaper gossip columns, provoked him to sue the music journal.'Totally Wired: The Rise and Fall of the Music Press' by Paul Gorman, Thames & Hudson, 2022

Gambotto-Burke then wrote ""A Man Called Horse"", the first cover story about alternative rock star Nick Cave to document his since-widely-reported heroin addiction. ""Shifting from bad to worse the interview collapses, along with Cave, into a series of broken thoughts and unfinished sentences,"" British author Adam Steiner has noted.'Darker with the Dawn: Nick Cave's Songs of Love and Death', by Adam Steiner, Rowman & Littlefield, 2023.

Cave, retaliating, stated in an interview with Sounds that Gambotto-Burke had ""brought her pyjamas along to the interview in place of a tape recorder"". The male journalist added, ""Hi, Antonella, and if you ever need to borrow my Sony ..."".‘Bad Seed Rising,’ by Bill Black, Sounds, 25 May 25, 1985 Gambotto-Burke's editor Mick Mercer, who had published the cover story about Cave, wrote to Sounds: ""I heard the tape of the interview and have yet to recover ... the piece eventually stated what other writers hadn't been brave enough to write. So what's the problem? Little Nick whittles his woodenly creative brain and makes sly insinuations about Antonella hauling in the bunk beds, anxious for the earth to move ... Cave dribbling in one corner.""'Cave Man Boogie' by Mick Mercer, Letters, Sounds, 8 June 1985

Mercer's letter was printed with the paper's apology: ""Sounds entirely accepts that Ms [Gambotto-Burke] conducts herself properly and professionally at all times and apologises to her and to [the magazine] for any suggestion to the contrary in Bill Black's interview with Nick Cave.""Reply to ‘Cave Man Boogie,’ Letters, Sounds, 8 June 1985

Cave, who had told Melody Maker journalists that he wanted to ""kill"" Gambotto-Burke,'Book Review : ‘Apple: Sex, Drugs, Motherhood and the Recovery of the Feminine by Antonella Gambotto-Burke', by John Robb, Louder than War, 10 July 2022 then wrote a song about her and Mat Snow entitled ""Scum""""Bet you think this song is about you"", by Dave Simpson, The Guardian, 13 December 2008

The Cave interview was included in Gambotto-Burke's anthology of interviews Lunch of Blood, while Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds included a version of ""Scum"" on their 2005 box set, B-Sides And Rarities. In turn, Gambotto-Burke wrote about her experience of interviewing Cave for an Australian magazine in 2006,""Scum: The Inside Dope"" by Antonella Gambotto-Burke, Men's Style, Spring 2006. and her interview with him was again reprinted in the anthology Nick Cave: Sinner, Saint.Nick Cave: Sinner, Saint – The True Confessions, edited by Mat Snow, Plexus Publishing, 2011.

Gambotto-Burke, in 2022, wrote at length about her experience of Cave in Apple: Sex, Drugs, Motherhood and the Recovery of the Feminine, describing him as a ""narcissist"" and a ""liar"", and elaborating on the impact of his actions on her life and daughter.

In February 2025, Gambotto-Burke revealed in an essay that the Harry Ransom Center of the University of Texas at Austin now owns the letters Martin Amis wrote her during their secret non-sexual five-year romance. They met, the letters show, when Gambotto-Burke was 19 and Amis was 35, and he proceeded to use her as the basis for various characters in his novels for the next 35 years. His second wife Isabel Fonseca also distorted Gambotto-Burke in her first novel, Attachment, using her as the basis for the fictional husband's obsession, a 19-year-old Italian-Australian. 

Gambotto-Burke writes in the essay: ""My fiancé and I were staying at the Radisson Blu Edwardian at Canary Wharf the night Martin’s death was announced. He broke the news to me, expecting tears, but all I experienced was an overwhelming sense of relief. I was glad Martin was dead. Four decades of literary obsession had come to an end. Fedexing Martin’s letters to Texas felt like an exorcism.""""Martin Amis stole my life"" by Antonella Gambotto-Burke, UnHerd, February 14 2025

Interview anthologies
Lunch of Blood (Random House, 1994), Gambotto-Burke's first book and first anthology, peaked at number six on the best-seller lists. The Newcastle Herald observed that Gambotto-Burke's ""command of language is delicious to the point where one wonders which came first, her wish to display her ability or the desire to share her impressions."" In 1997, An Instinct for the Kill, her second anthology, was published to mixed reviews by HarperCollins. (The Age critic Katherine Wilson singled out the Capper interview as ""laugh-out-loud"" funny.)'The Best Australian Profiles: Review', by Katherine Wilson, The Age, 23 October 2004

In  The Best Australian Profiles, Professor Matthew Ricketson wrote the introduction to Gambotto-Burke's work: ""[She] is probably the closest Australia has come to having a profile writer who is a celebrity in their own right ... and from the early 1990s readers became as interested in Gambotto-Burke as they were in the people she profiled.""The Best Australian Profiles, edited by Matthew Ricketson, Black Inc., 2004.

In a review of the book, British author and The Daily Telegraph writer Gwyneth Rees wrote, ""Argued with intelligence, force and the fury of righteous indignation by lauded feminist thinker, author and critic Antonella Gambotto-Burke, the book explores how the manner in which we enter the world has a profound and lasting impact on our lives, and by extension upon society as a whole. As we come to learn, modern obstetric practices are deeply connected with an increased likelihood in later life of drug use, sexual fetishes, anxiety and mental illness, chronic and potentially life-threatening illnesses. They are also linked with the breakdown of relationships between men and women, and the erosion of the bond between mothers and children. This all comes to light through Apple's central question: why is our culture governed by the principle of separation?"" ""Apple: Sex, Drugs, Motherhood and the Recovery of the Feminine by Antonella Gambotto-Burke"", by Gwyneth Rees, Female First, 9 June 2022

Personal life
At the age of 22, Gambotto-Burke became engaged to the notorious American-born UK GQ editor Michael VerMeulen. She left VerMeulen in 1990, citing, in The Eclipse: A Memoir of Suicide, his drug abuse as a primary reason. He later died of a cocaine overdose.""Editor died from cocaine overdose"", The Independent, 8 November 1995'Boyz II Men', by Michael Wolff, New York Magazine, 18 September 2000

After her brother Gianluca, a Macquarie Bank executive,The Eclipse: A Memoir of Suicide by Antonella Gambotto-Burke gassed himself in his car at the age of 32, Gambotto-Burke began reading ""obsessively"" about death and suicide, trying, as she said in a national Australian cover interview, to make sense of the experience, trying to become big enough to let go of my brother. That's what bereavement is about – surrendering the memory, the relationship.""""Death and the Maiden"" by Murray Waldren, The Weekend Australian, 20–21 March 1994.

The Eclipse: A Memoir of Suicide (2004) is about her brother's 2001 death and her engagement to, and the death of, VerMeulen. In another interview, she said: ""I wanted to explain depression as a valid emotional response rather than as a disease"".'Soul Searcher', by Laura McCreddie, Yoga Magazine, November 2003""I couldn't save my brother from suicide – the biggest killer of British men under 45"", by Antonella Gambotto-Burke, The Telegraph, London, 31 March 2018.

In his 2023 review of the Finnish edition of The Eclipse, poet Kimmo Leijala wrote, ""Sometimes [Gambotto-Burke] goes through a strict, even self-critical monologue, which also includes a lot of universal reflection and existential questions ... [and] the versatile use of language can read like poetry"". The Eclipse is a Good Grief Trust recommended book, and the American Psychological Association website describes The Eclipse: A Memoir of Suicide as ""brilliant"".'A Memoir of Suicide', by Béla Buda, Crisis: The Journal of Crisis Intervention and Suicide Prevention, Vol 25(2), 2004, p95

On 24 November 2023 Gambotto-Burke and multi-platinum record producer Gavin Monaghan announced their engagement. The two had been working together since late 2022 as Mama ft.

221,15487,75425963,7361,Jetwing Vil Uyana,"Jetwing Vil Uyana () is a boutique eco hotel situated in Sigiriya, Sri Lanka. Jetwing Vil Uyana was launched in 2006 and inspired by the Barnes Wetland, London. Jetwing Vil Uyana is owned and operated by the Sri Lankan hotel chain Jetwing Hotels. The hotel was built in 2006 by converting an abandoned paddy field into an artificial wetland. Environmental architect Sunela Jayawardena designed the hotel. The hotel is known for its sustainability. In 2023, Condé Nast Traveller listed the hotel among the 15 best eco-hotels in the world.

History and architecture
Jetwing Vil Uyana was launched in 2006 and was inspired by the Barnes Wetland, London. Jetwing Vil Uyana has featured in National Geographic Traveler'''s 2013 June edition of ""The World's Best Ecolodges"". Jetwing Vil Uyana is constructed on an artificially built wetland. The hotel is situated in the vicinity of Sigiriya. Sunela Jayawardena who is known for her environmental architecture, designed the hotel. In 2004, an abandoned paddy field was converted into a 28-acre nature reserve.

Sustainability
In 2023, Condé Nast Traveller'' named the hotel as one of the 15 best eco-hotels in the world. Jetwing Hotels started the Jetwing Youth Development Project (JYDP) in 2006. Under the JYDP, the company offered a job training program for local youth around the Jetwing Vil Uyana Hotel. At the end of the program, about 50 graduates were hired by Jetwing. The JYDP programme has won several awards over the years.

The faunal diversity of the hotel has increased since the construction of the hotel. The biodiversity of the hotel consists of 157 bird species, 29 mammalian species, and several butterfly, reptilian and amphibian species.

225,57632,76623179,14581,Rocky Reach AVA,"Rocky Reach is an American Viticultural Area (AVA) located within portions of Chelan and Douglas Counties between the cities Chelan and Wenatchee in central Washington state.  The area is an elongated strip of land that straddles the Columbia River entirely within the vast Columbia Valley AVA. Rocky Reach is the state's 20th AVA recognized by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau {TTB), Treasury on July 5, 2022, after reviewing the petition submitted by Whitman College professor and geologist, Dr. Kevin Pogue, on behalf of regional winemakers and vineyard owners, to establish a viticultural area named ""Rocky Reach.""

The name ""Rocky Reach"" originated from 19th-century nautical nomenclature where steamboat captains navigating the Columbia River describe the rapids in a particularly rocky ""stretch"" or ""reach"" of the river. The AVA encompasses  with the Columbia River and the Rocky Reach Reservoir constituting approximately 24 percent of the total area. There are 7 commercial vineyards with approximately  under vine with a sole winery.

Terroir
Topography
The distinguishing features of the Rocky Reach AVA are its topography, geology, soils, and climate. Rocky Reach AVA is located along a stretch of the Columbia River where the river has eroded a deep canyon between the foothills of the Cascade Range to the west and the Waterville Plateau and Badger Mountain to the east. Elevations within the AVA are below . Near the floor of the canyon and along the canyon sides are flat-topped terraces. According to the petition, the terraces within the AVA have long been used for agricultural purposes, including viticulture, due to the ease of farming on the nearly level ground. West of the Rocky Reach. the terrain is rugged and mountainous and elevations rise rapidly to over . To the east of the viticultural area, elevations are also higher, rising to an average of  on the Waterville Plateau. According to the petition, the terrain is much steeper to the east of the AVA. To the north, within the established Lake Chelan AVA, glaciers eroded a deep and broad glacial trough that is now filled by Lake Chelan. South of the Rocky Reach, the valley of the Columbia River abruptly widens where the bedrock changes from hard, erosion-resistant metamorphic rocks to much softer sedimentary rocks.

Geology
According to the petition, 95 percent of the surface bedrock within the established Columbia Valley AVA consists of Cenozoic volcanic and sedimentary rock, predominantly Miocene Columbia River basalt, which is silica-poor and iron-rich. However, within the Rocky Reach AVA, erosion has removed the basalt and carved a deep valley into the underlying Mesozoic crystalline basement rocks. According to the petition, the region north of the AVA, specifically the established Lake Chelan AVA, is the only other region within the Columbia River AVA that has this crystalline basement bedrock. These rocks consist primarily of metamorphosed sedimentary and igneous rocks that are silica-rich and dominated by minerals like quartz and mica that are not found in the regions to the east, south, and west of the AVA, which has basalt bedrock. As a result, grapevine roots that reach the bedrock of the AVA come into contact with a chemical environment that is distinct from that associated with basalt bedrock.

Soil
The petition states that the soils of the AVA formed from wind-deposited sand and silt overlying cobblestone gravel, as well as from sand deposited by ice-age floods. The soils are typically clay-poor and well- to excessively well-drained. The thickness of the sand and silt is generally greater on the higher terraces within the proposed AVA, as their greater age has allowed more time for soils to be deposited. Most of the vineyards in the AVA are on the lower terraces, where the soils are very coarse-grained and consist largely of cobblestones deposited by glacial floods and outwash. According to the petition, the stony surfaces of the lower terraces warm quickly. The hot stones then radiate heat to the vines, promoting faster and more complete ripening. The coarse soils also more efficiently transmit water to deeper soil horizons, which encourages deeper root penetration than in silty or sandy soils. Finally, the petition notes that vineyards in stony soils do not require the use of cover crops since erosion is not an issue due to the coarse texture. To the north of the AVA, the soils of the glaciated valleys formed from glacial till, which is sediment deposited directly by melting glacial ice. The soils also contain volcanic ash and pumice, which are uncommon within Rocky Reach AVA. Fine-grained loess and sand over a basalt substratum dominate the soils in the regions to the south and east of Rocky Reach AVA.

Climate
Rocky Reach AVA's location at low elevations within the deep valley of the Columbia River allows it to have a warmer and longer growing season than the higher elevations of the surrounding mountains and plateaus. The petition included data on temperatures for the period of 2015–2017 measured at two locations within the proposed AVA and two locations in the region to the north of the proposed AVA. The data indicates that the Rocky Reach AVA generally has warmer average annual temperatures than the regions to the north and higher maximum temperatures. During the three-year period, the average temperature within the proposed Rocky Reach AVA was , with an average maximum temperature of  . The highest maximum temperature measured during that period was  . The average minimum temperature within the AVA was  . The lowest minimum temperature was  . The average soil temperature was  . By comparison, during the same three-year period, the average temperature within the region to the north of the AVA was  , with an average maximum temperature of  . The highest maximum temperature measured during that time period was  . The average minimum temperature within the region to the north was the same as within the AVA, and the lowest minimum temperature was  , which was similar to the lowest minimum temperature within the AVA. The average soil temperature was .

Industry
Rocky Pond Estate Winery planted the first vineyard in the Rocky Reach locale in 2013. The winery subsequently planted a second vineyard in 2018 and another in the neighboring Lake Chelan AVA. Currently, Rocky Pond is the only winery within the appellation. When the TTB recognized the Rocky Reach appellation in July 2022, there were seven commercial vineyards with approximately  under vine.",2025-01-12,"['American Viticultural Areas' 'Geography of Franklin County, Washington'

 PWHPA 

Following the dissolution of the Canadian Women's Hockey League (CWHL) in 2019, over 200 prominent women's players, including Canadian and American national team players, founded the Professional Women's Hockey Players Association (PWHPA) to advocate for and organize towards a unified and stable professional women's hockey league. Although the National Women's Hockey League (NWHL) had been founded as the first truly professional women's league in 2015, PWHPA players vowed to boycott it. The NWHL was blamed in part for the collapse of the CWHL, and PWHPA players also saw the NWHL as unstable—for example, it had a history of pay cuts and minimum salaries reportedly as low as $2,000. As such, the PWHPA intended to instead pursue the establishment of a new league with what they considered a sustainable business model.

The PWHPA spent the next several years courting corporate, media, and National Hockey League (NHL) partnerships, organizing a ""Dream Gap"" tour to generate support for its goal. For its part, the NHL proved unwilling to put its support fully behind the Premier Hockey Federation (PHF)—the rebranded NWHL—or establishing a new women's league with the PWHPA, and it encouraged the sides to discuss a merger.

In 2022, the PWHPA entered a partnership with Mark Walter and Billie Jean King with the intent to launch their new professional league.

 The PWHL 
In February 2023, the PWHPA organized a formal union—the PWHLPA—to represent players and negotiate a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) for the new league. On June 29, it was announced that the PWHPA's two business partners, under the names of Mark Walter Group and BJK Enterprises, had purchased the PHF and its intellectual properties with the intent of effectively winding it down and merging it with the new venture. The partners then announced the foundation of the Professional Women's Hockey League (PWHL), with the intent to begin play in January 2024. On July 2, the PWHLPA formally ratified the new CBA, set to last for eight years, expiring in the summer of 2031.

The CBA establishes that each PWHL team must sign at least six players to a minimum salary of $80,000, and no more than nine players to a league minimum salary of $35,000, with teams instructed to achieve an average salary of $55,000; the base and average salaries are slated to increase 3% per season through the end of the agreement. The CBA further outlines performance and team bonuses, including a $63,250 bonus for the championship-winning team, and other financial incentives, including housing stipends and retirement plans. The agreement also includes health and disability insurance and workers' compensation, as well as guarantees around medical examinations and assistance and player safety.

On August 29, the union hired Brian Burke as its executive director. In the fall of 2023, it was revealed that the union's executive committee consisted of PWHL players Brianne Jenner, Sarah Nurse, Hilary Knight, and Kendall Coyne Schofield, and former PWHPA board member and CWHL Players Association chair Liz Knox. In December 2023, less than two weeks before the start of the inaugural PWHL season, each team selected a player representative to serve on the union's board of directors.

228,45401,5373023,5246,National Popular Vote Inc.,"National Popular Vote Inc. is a non-profit organization based in Los Altos, California, launched in 2006 by Barry Fadem and John Koza. Its purpose is ""to study, analyze and educate the public regarding its proposed interstate compact providing for the nationwide popular election of the President of the United States,"" and it developed and champions the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact.

The proposal
The group's website describes their approach as follows:
""Nationwide popular election of the President can be implemented if the states join together to pass identical state laws awarding all of their electoral votes to the presidential candidate receiving the most popular votes in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The proposed state legislation would come into effect only when it has been enacted, in identical form, by enough states to elect a President -- that is, by states possessing a majority (270) of the 538 electoral votes.""

The group developed and champions the adoption of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which is an agreement among a group of U.S. states and the District of Columbia to award all their electoral votes to whichever presidential candidate wins the overall popular vote in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The compact is designed to ensure that the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide is elected president, and it would come into effect only when it would guarantee that outcome.

Progress

Within the first several months of its 2006 launch and media campaign, National Popular Vote's proposal began to make progress in various state legislatures. Early action occurred both in large Democratic strongholds California, New York, and Illinois, as well as in medium-sized swing and red states such as Colorado, Missouri, and Louisiana.

, 17 states and the District of Columbia have joined the compact; collectively, these jurisdictions control 209 electoral votes, which is 77% of the 270 required for the compact to take effect.

229,27657,75747462,5644,2024 Pokrovsk missile strike,"On 6 January 2024, at around 3:00 pm local time, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Army launched an S-300 missile attack against a residential building in Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, eastern Ukraine, as a result of which 12 people died, including 6 children.

Shelling
On the night of January 6, the Russians shelled the private sector, as a result of which the garage and cars caught fire. The strike at the administrative building was also recorded. In Rivne, Pokrovsk Raion, a private house in which 6 people lived was destroyed.

Earlier on that day, Ukraine hit the Saky air base in Russian-occupied Crimea.

Reactions
 President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video message ""These hours, a rescue operation is underway in Pokrovsk of the Donetsk region and in the Pokrovsk Raion after a Russian missile strike. S-300 missiles. Necessary rescue forces, equipment of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine are involved. Debris is being sorted out.

231,31293,5335894,9451,Methyllithium,"Methyllithium is the simplest organolithium reagent, with the empirical formula LiCH3. This s-block organometallic compound adopts an oligomeric structure both in solution and in the solid state. This highly reactive compound, invariably used in solution with an ether as the solvent, is a reagent in organic synthesis as well as organometallic chemistry. Operations involving methyllithium require anhydrous conditions, because the compound is highly reactive towards water. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are also incompatible with MeLi. Methyllithium is usually not prepared, but purchased as a solution in various ethers.

Synthesis
In the direct synthesis, methyl bromide is treated with a suspension of lithium in diethyl ether.
2 Li + MeBr → LiMe + LiBr
The lithium bromide forms a complex with the methyllithium.  Most commercially available methyllithium consists of this complex.  ""Low-halide"" methyllithium is prepared from methyl chloride. Lithium chloride precipitates from the diethyl ether since it does not form a strong complex with methyllithium.  The filtrate consists of fairly pure methyllithium. Alternatively, commercial methyllithium can be treated with dioxane to precipitate LiBr(dioxane), which can be removed by filtration.  The use of halide-free vs LiBr-MeLi has a decisive effect on some syntheses.

Reactivity
Methyllithium is both strongly basic and highly nucleophilic due to the partial negative charge on carbon and is therefore particularly reactive towards electron acceptors and proton donors.  In contrast to n-BuLi, MeLi reacts only very slowly with THF at room temperature, and solutions in ether are indefinitely stable.  Water and alcohols react violently.  Most reactions involving methyllithium are conducted below room temperature. Although MeLi can be used for deprotonations, n-butyllithium is more commonly employed since it is less expensive and more reactive.

Methyllithium is mainly used as the synthetic equivalent of the methyl anion synthon.  For example, ketones react to give tertiary alcohols in a two-step process:
Ph2CO + MeLi → Ph2C(Me)OLi
Ph2C(Me)OLi + H+ → Ph2C(Me)OH + Li+

Nonmetal halides are converted to methyl compounds with methyllithium:
PCl3 + 3 MeLi → PMe3 + 3 LiCl
Such reactions more commonly employ the Grignard reagents methylmagnesium halides, which are often equally effective, and less expensive or more easily prepared in situ.

It also reacts with carbon dioxide to give Lithium acetate:
CH3Li + CO2 → CH3CO2−Li+

Transition metal methyl compounds can be prepared by reaction of MeLi with metal halides.  Especially important are the formation of organocopper compounds (Gilman reagents), of which the most useful is lithium dimethylcuprate. This reagent is widely used for nucleophilic substitutions of epoxides, alkyl halides and alkyl sulfonates, as well as for conjugate additions to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds by methyl anion.  Many other transition metal methyl compounds have been prepared. 
ZrCl4 + 6 MeLi → Li2ZrMe6 +  4 LiCl

Structure
Two structures have been verified by single crystal X-ray crystallography as well as by 6Li, 7Li, and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The tetrameric structure is a distorted cubane-type cluster, with carbon and lithium atoms at alternate corners. The Li---Li distances are 2.68 Å, almost identical with the Li-Li bond in gaseous dilithium. The C-Li distances are 2.31 Å.  Carbon is bonded to three hydrogen atoms and three Li atoms.  The nonvolatility of (MeLi)4 and its insolubility in alkanes results from the fact that the clusters interact via further inter-cluster agostic interactions.  In contrast the bulkier cluster (tertiary-butylLi)4, where intercluster interactions are precluded by steric effects, is volatile as well as soluble in alkanes.

  

Colour code: Li- purple C- black H- white

The hexameric form features hexagonal prisms with Li and C atoms again at alternate corners.

   

Colour code: Li- purple C- black H- white

The degree of aggregation, ""n"" for (MeLi)n, depends upon the solvent and the presence of additives (such as lithium bromide). Hydrocarbon solvents such as benzene favour formation of the hexamer, whereas ethereal solvents favour the tetramer.

Bonding
These clusters are considered ""electron-deficient,"" that is, they do not follow the octet rule because the molecules lack sufficient electrons to form four 2-centered, 2-electron bonds around each carbon atom, in contrast to most organic compounds. The hexamer is a 30 electron compound (30 valence electrons.) If one allocates 18 electrons for the strong C-H bonds, 12 electrons remain for Li-C and Li-Li bonding. There are six electrons for six metal-metal bonds and one electron per methyl-η3 lithium interaction.

The strength of the C-Li bond has been estimated at around 57 kcal/mol from IR spectroscopic measurements.",2025-04-07,"['Organolithium compounds' 'Methylating agents' 'Methyl complexes'

Premise
A frontier con man tries scams that never work, leaving his partner behind to explain.

Cast
 Fred Williamson as Ben ""Big Ben""
 Richard Pryor as Sam Spade
 James Brown as Sheriff
 Robert Phillips as Notary
 Mike Henry as Mary's Husband

Production
The idea for the project came from Pryor's initial frustration of being rejected from starring in Mel Brooks's Blazing Saddles after collaborating with him on the screenplay, and Williamson's dislike of the finished film, which he considered silly. The goal was to make a comedy that would still be realistic to its Western setting, and which would allow Pryor to work without restraint. The initial script was only 12 pages, with Williamson encouraging Pryor to ad-lib scenarios in a suggested scene. Principal photography took only nine days.

Reception
Ultimately, both Williamson and Pryor were disappointed with the results. ""I wanted to give him an idea, a concept, and then just turn the light on him and let him do whatever he wanted. You know what they say about comedians that you can just open the refrigerator door and the light comes on, the jokes roll on out. Well, Richard's light didn't come on,"" said Williamson. In an interview with Ebony shortly after the movie came out, Pryor said, ""Tell them I apologize. Tell them I needed some money. Tell them I promise not to do it again.""

Despite the negative opinions of its stars, the film garnered a positive review from Gene Siskel. During a Sneak Previews ""Dog of the Week"" segment, often devoted to low-budget films cashing in on name star appearances, Siskel mentioned approaching Adios Amigo as a potential ""dog"" because it didn't sound like a good movie in previews, but found it to be a very funny and enjoyable film that resulted in him stating that he had no ""dog"" selection after all for that week's show.",2024-12-21,"['1976 films' '1970s Western (genre) comedy films'

 Biography 
Poché was born the son of an Austrian father in the Syrian city of Aleppo, a centre of traditional Arabic music, where he spent most of his life. He lived several years of his youth in Lebanon, where he held the position of General Secretary, and then director of the Jeunesses Musicales (Musical Youths) from 1961 to 1969. During this time he also worked for two years as a music critic for the Lebanese newspaper L'Orient-Le Jour.  After his studies in Germany, he was appointed as researcher at the International Institute for Comparative Music Studies in Berlin and as co-editor of The World of Music magazine during the early 1970s.

A former member of the Institute of the Arab World in Paris, he is the author of books and articles on Near Eastern, Arabic and African traditional music styles, notably in encyclopedias such as the  Encyclopédie de la musique, the Grove Dictionary of Musical Instruments and the Garland Encyclopaedia of World Music. He was also part of the scientific committee of the Ocora and UNESCO record collections. For several of his numerous editions of Near Eastern music, he was awarded the French Charles-Cros prize.

Among others, he produced audio recordings of the liturgical music of the Syriac Orthodox Church. Historically spread across communities in Antioch, Tur 'Abdin, Urfa, Mardin in modern Turkey, as well as in Aleppo and Qamishli in modern Syria, this Oriental Orthodox church uses the Syriac language, an Aramaic historical language similar to that spoken by Jesus Christ and the Apostles.

A producer at Radio France, Poché presented regular programmes of world music such as the  Vocabulaire des musiques traditionnelles (Vocabulary of Traditional Music). Another of his radio programmes was broadcast on France Vivace called Sanza, and subsequently renamed Zambra.

Poché died on 3 December 2010 in Paris.

235,24745,5318877,8389,Bay 50th Street station,"The Bay 50th Street station is a local station on the BMT West End Line of the New York City Subway, located at the intersection of Bay 50th Street and Stillwell Avenue in the Gravesend neighborhood of Brooklyn. It is served by the D train at all times. It is in front of the campus of John Dewey High School and has been adopted by its students as part of the New York City Transit Authority's Adopt-a-Station Program.

 History 
Early history

Bay 50th Street opened on July 21, 1917 as part of the final extension of the BMT West End Line from 25th Avenue to Coney Island.

The line was originally a surface excursion railway to Coney Island, called the Brooklyn, Bath and Coney Island Railroad, which was established in 1862, but did not reach Coney Island until 1864.Opening of the Brooklyn, Bath and Coney Island Railroad, The New York Times June 9, 1864 page 2 Under the Dual Contracts of 1913, an elevated line was built over New Utrecht Avenue, 86th Street and Stillwell Avenue, replacing the surface railway.

Later years
The platforms were extended in the 1960s to accommodate the current standard B Division train length of .

As part of an 18-month capital budget that took effect on January 1, 1963, the wooden platforms at the stations on the West End Line were replaced with concrete platforms.

In the 1980s, this station was adopted by students of Lafayette High School as part of New York City Transit's ""Adopt a Station"" program.

In 2012, the station was rehabilitated with funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Four laminated glass windscreens by artist Amy Cheng, commissioned by the MTA Arts for Transit Program, were installed in July 2012 as part of the renovation.

Station layout

This station has three tracks and two side platforms. The center express track is not normally used. Both platforms have beige windscreens and brown canopies with green frames and support columns in the center and high mesh fences at either end. The station signs are in the standard black plates with white lettering. Platform extensions are visible to the north on the northbound platform and to the south on the southbound platform, providing views of the Coney Island Complex.

The station is situated in the middle of a wye, with track leads from the West End Line to the Coney Island Complex merging with the northbound track immediately north and south of the platforms. South of this station, the center track merges with the other two tracks. The line also lowers to run at-grade adjacent to the Coney Island Yard. An abandoned railroad tower is located above the center of the northbound platform; it has been replaced by a modern tower, about  to the south.

Exits
There are two exit points, each with one stairway to each side of Stillwell Avenue: one at both northern corners of Harway Avenue at the station's extreme south end, and the other at both southern corners of Bay 50th Street in the middle.

In popular culture
Bay 50th Street was the starting point of the classic chase sequence in the 1971 movie The French Connection.",2025-03-17,"['BMT West End Line stations' 'New York City Subway stations in Brooklyn'

236,9170,75226898,25494,Cuban Solidarity Movement in the United States,"The Cuban Independence movement consisted of 3 wars over 40 years in which the United States involved itself to various degrees. These are the 10-Years' War, The Little War, and The Cuban War of Independence. These conflicts evoked multiple levels of support from different groups within the United States, which changed over time and as the conflicts progressed. African Americans showed heavy support in the early stages of the conflict, while business leaders were more inclined to withhold their support. The position of the U.S. government shifted throughout the conflict in accordance with presidential administrations. Many factors shaped these reactions within the United States, including the economy, The Yellow fever, and events like the Sinking of the U.S.S. Maine, and the Virginius Affair. The United States did not directly involve itself in the conflict until the Spanish-American War, known by the Cubans as the Cuban War of Independence in 1896.

 Background 

The Cuban Independence Movement began in 1868 with the uprising of Cubans from the eastern provinces. Under Spanish rule, Cuban nationals experienced high tax rates, poor political management, and little representation in the homeland. Under the leadership of Manuel de Céspedes, The Cubans declared independence, Initiating the 10-Years' War. The rebels' interests ranged from ending slavery to gaining economic freedom from Spain, which would give more political power to the individual laborer. Before the revolution gained enough traction to overthrow Spanish rule, Spanish political leaders sent General Arsênio Martinez Campos to crush the rebellion. After the death of Céspedes and other key leaders of the independence movement, Campos created a new constitution, and the war ended.

After the constitution's creation, a relapse in rebel activity led to what is known as the Little War, in which Calixto Garcia led a second rebel uprising to war with the Spanish establishment in a conflict that lasted less than a year. The rebels were ill-equipped to fight against the Spanish government. They faced a myriad of problems, from a lack of supplies like ammunition and weapons to a lack of foreign support from other countries, making the attempted revolution a lost cause. By the end of the war, the leaders of the insurgents had been captured and imprisoned.

After the 17 years of relative peace prompted by the Spanish victory over Cuban rebels in the Little War, changes in the social climate, such as the freeing of the slaves in 1886, caused economic decline to a catastrophic degree. These factors prompted Cuban nationals to once again move towards independence from Spain, On February 24, 1895 with the issuing of the ""Grito de Baire"" declaring ""Independencia o Muerte"" (independence or death). This declaration of independence was met with support from the United States of America, Initiating what is known in the United States as the Spanish-American War and in Cuba as the Necessary War (Guerra Necesaria.)

 African Americans 
The first solidarity movement in Cuba started with the Ten Years' War in 1868. Many African Americans in the United States Identified strongly with the movement due to the significant role that slavery played in the economy of Cuba. Having recently received their freedom, African Americans felt the responsibility to eradicate slavery on a global level. Cuba presented itself as the perfect opportunity to make a difference with the newly gained freedoms Africans in the United States had received. Leaders among the African American groups like Frederick Douglass and Henry Highland Garnett postulated that true Cuban independence could only be true independence if it included the abolition of slavery. This position generally aligned with that of Cuban leaders such as Carlos Manuel de Céspedes. When Cespedes Initiated the independence movement, he freed his slaves, garnering support from many formerly enslaved people in the states.

 The Conspiracy of la Escalera 

In 1821, Spain committed to ending the shipment of slaves to Cuba. When this promise was left unmet, slaves in Cuba pushed back, causing what was known as the conspiracy of la escalera. The events that ensued sparked the early beginnings of Cuban independence from the side of Cuban-Africans. When the Cuban government received word of a purported slave uprising that was to take place on Christmas in December 1843, they issued a manhunt of all suspected participants of African descent, both free and enslaved. Many of those who were caught were tied to a ladder (escalera) and whipped until they confessed the names of other conspirators involved. The leaders of the conspiracy were lined up and killed by firing squad. Most blacks that were captured were killed, but all whites arrested were eventually released. Despite the dire consequences, it is debated whether the conspiracy was real or whether it was invented by the Spanish government to squash possible future insurgents. The events of la Escalera provoked outrage among African Americans, changing what were initially sympathies among the community into outright support.

 Perceived unity 
In the mid to late 1800s, enslaved Africans formed a considerable part of the population and economy in Cuba. In the United States, inequality was still prevalent with continued segregation and Jim Crow laws following the recent freeing of the enslaved people. The country, however, was still very much divided. One of the contributions that provoked African-American support was the unity found among the rebel fighters in Cuba. The slaves freed by their owners fought alongside them in equal fashion, contrasting the vast division located within the U.S. The Manifesto of Montecristi contributed significantly to the demand for unity among the different races of Cuba. Jose Marti authored the manifesto stating the absolute necessity of all blacks' participation in the independence movement and the complete unity between blacks and whites in the fight against Spain. 

 The Cuban Anti-Slavery Committee 

Founded by Henry Highland Garnet in reaction to the 10-year war in Cuba, the committee was created in opposition to widespread slavery that continued in Cuba after the freeing of the slaves in the United States. The committee was created to garner more widespread support and outrage among Americans to aid Cuban insurgents who were adamantly anti-slavery. Furthermore, it was believed that activism on the foreign front against slavery would shed light on the injustice experienced within the United States. The committee took action by collecting signatures on a petition to present to Congress, catalyzing a movement that resulted in hundreds of thousands of signatures. The committee also published several pamphlets, including Slavery in Cuba, which raised awareness of the injustices that enslaved Cubans experienced. The popularity and support that the committee garnered grew to such an extent that they received an audience with President Grant. Despite his reception of Garnet and the committee, he did not promise support for the cause due likely to his secretary of State, Hamilton Fish, who felt that the race of the Cubans made them undeserving of American support.

 Division in the Spanish–American War 
As the nature of the conflict changed the widespread support of Cuban Solidarity by African-Americans shifted, becoming more split with the sinking of the Maine and the involvement of the United States in the Spanish-American War. Some publications, like the Washington Bee, openly opposed black support of Cuban independence, stating that blacks in the U.S. should deal with their problems in the United States before becoming preoccupied with Cuban solidarity. Furthermore, there was the worry that by entering the war, Americans would bring the prejudices that blacks had experienced on the mainland to Cuba, aggravating the problems already present on the Island. They argued that racial discrimination in the United States was far worse than any that Cubans had experienced under the likes of General Valeriano Weyler and that the cruelty of southern Whites in the U.S far surpassed that of Spaniards. Other journalists in black-run newspapers openly supported the entry of the U.S. into the war. E.E. Cooper of The Colored American pointed out the difference between imperialism and expansion, advocating that winning the war would benefit both the Cubans and the United States. He argued that the war was an opportunity for African Americans to prove their worth and to forge a stronger brotherhood with the other races that made up the United States. He also theorized that with the independence of Cuba and a newly established rapport between the United States and Cuba, blacks would be able to relocate to Cuba, which would surely be free of racial prejudice and discrimination. Rhetoric like that of E.E. coopers inspired many African Americans to Volunteer for the militia, being among the first units mobilized in the war, with eight states contributing all-black units to the war force.

 Influences affecting American involvement in the conflict 

 U.S.S. Maine 

The U.S.S. Maine, positioned in Havana Harbor to safeguard U.S. interests during the ongoing conflict between Cuba and Spain, has been described as an armored cruiser or second-class battleship. While representing an advance in American warships, it was obsolete by the time it was completed. During the evening of February 15, 1898, under calm weather, the vessel was engulfed in an explosion and sank, resulting in the deaths of three-quarters of her crew. While it was clear that the ship's forward magazines had exploded, the cause of this was uncertain, with theories including an internal buildup of gas from low-quality coal in adjacent bunkers and the alleged mining of the harbor by Spain – the latter theory being reported as fact in American newspapers. Proponents of war coined rallying cries, such as ""Remember the Maine! To hell with Spain!"" to mobilize support for U.S. intervention. The Maine became a talking point in popular American culture, referenced in music of the period. The U.S. public was divided over the best course of action for the country. Many wished for the United States to prove itself an equal to the major European powers, and acquiring Cuba as a colony was one path toward achieving this status.

 American business 
During the time leading up to the United States' involvement in the conflict between Spain and Cuba, extensive discourse ensued among business owners. These discussions centered on the potential economic repercussions and implications that war would have on the nation. Considerable deliberation revolved around the anticipated effects on American businesses and whether the involvement in the conflict would prove beneficial or detrimental to the United States. Various newspapers engaged in discussions about how war might jeopardize the stability of the currency, disrupt trade, and pose threats to U.S. coasts and commerce. Railroad companies thought they would lose more than they would gain. Even arms manufacturers thought that going to war would not be profitable. Journals speaking for the steel and iron manufacturers wrote that war “would injure the iron and steel makers ten times as much as they would be benefited by the prevailing spurt in the manufacture of small arms, projectiles, and steel plates for warships”.

 Yellow fever 

In 1877, Yellow fever broke out in the United States and caused massive economic losses estimated to be at least 100 million dollars. Over 120 thousand people contracted the disease, and more than 20 thousand died. U.S. health officials were convinced that Havana was the origin and felt that to stop the disease and prevent more losses, the disease needed to be studied and understood. In 1879, the United States Board of Health organized and sent a group of experts named the Havana Yellow Fever Commission to Cuba to study yellow fever and suggest policies that would stop the importation of the disease from Cuba and into the United States. While there, they found that Cuba had poor sanitation conditions that fostered the spread and cultivation of the Yellow fever disease. The Commission then suggested that ships that had been in Cuban ports would be disinfected and their cargoes quarantined before they were allowed to port in the United States. Despite these efforts to protect United States citizens from contracting yellow fever on September 6, 1897, word broke out across the South that yellow fever was in New Orleans. U.S. soldiers that were stationed there were transferred to Fort McPherson in Atlanta Georgia by order of evacuation. By the end of that week, all railroads 300 miles around New Orleans were shut down. Word spread across the United States concerning yellow fever and the cases popped up all across the south. In Edwards Mississippi, several cases began to pop up and in just a matter of a few days, half of the residences in the capital city of Jackson became empty due to its inhabitants seeking refuge from the disease. By the end of the year, 700 cases of yellow fever were diagnosed in New Orleans and the disease had taken 200 lives. The Yellow fever epidemic only got worse when the Cuba’s War of Independence broke out. The war provided ideal conditions for the spread of the disease in Havana. As such, the fear surrounding the disease created reluctancy to enter the conflict. The influx of Spanish soldiers that had never experienced yellow fever led to a huge increase in cases of the disease.

 Economic interests in Cuba 
Cuba's several industries, including sugar and tobacco, benefited mainly from trade with the United States. However, tensions soon grew between the two countries as the United States started implementing policies that benefited their own markets and excluded Cuba.

 Tobacco 
The Cuban tobacco industry in the 19th century catered primarily to western markets like the United States. As the demand for tobacco grew the United States tobacco industry began to grow, as well as the European tobacco industry. The American Tobacco Company (ATC) and the Imperial Tobacco Company (ITC) began to monopolize and place tariffs to protect their markets, which hurt the Cuban tobacco industry. Taking control of the Cuban markets as a result of freeing Cuba from Spanish rule provided compelling reason to entering the war. Later, the ATC and ITC struck an agreement that said that Cuba and Puerto Rico were ATC lands. In 1930, the United States started mass-producing cigarettes thanks to the development of new machinery. These actions undercut Cuba's tobacco industry, where tobacco overproduction and lack of the U.S. patented machine for making cigarettes were both problems.

 Government support 

 President Grant 

With the commencement of the 10 Years war in 1868 various groups who supported Cuban independence applied pressure to President Ulysses S. Grant to enter the conflict in an attempts to aid Cuba. Many looked to the united states as an emancipatory power that after recently having freed its own slaves, would fight for the cause of freedom in Cuba as well. This included groups such as the Cuban Anti-Slavery Committee and Cubans who had immigrated to the United States. Rather than directly intervene in Cuba, Grant instead proposed the annexation of Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic. This was done in the name of Monroe Doctrine with Grant making the claim that the annexation would provide an advantageous position to combat slavery in Cuba. It's unclear how this affected the conflict in Cuba. One of the most influential contributors to Grant's policy on the war were the government officials he associated with. These included the figures such as Hamilton Fish, and George Henry Williams Despite domestic support of certain groups, Grant was reluctant to enter in the war and instead engaged in a sort of cold war with Spain. The administration came closest to entering the war with the Virginius Affair in which an American owned steamboat carrying supplies and weapons to Cuba was captured by the Spanish and the crew tried on land. The trial resulted in 53 executions of the Cuban, American, and British crewmen. The executions provoked outrage among the American public applying pressure on Grant to enter the war. Rather than enter the war however, Grant made several demands to the Spanish government. These were: the punishment of those involved in the executions, the returning of the ship and crew who had not been executed, and the payment in restitutions of 80,000$. Spain agreed to the terms and War was avoided.

 Hamilton Fish 
Hamilton Fish was the secretary of state at the time of the Grant administration. Fish played a pivotal role in keeping the United States out of the war, having a great influence on both President Grant and his cabinet. This allowed him to be one of the chief figures in the shaping of the foreign policy of the federal government towards Spain. He was appointed secretary of state by Grant in 1869 shortly after the commencement of the war. Throughout his career as secretary of state he focused on minimizing the financial costs of foreign policy in examples such as the ownership conflict of the U.S.S. Alabamaand most notably in Cuba. Fishs' aims in regard to Cuban the war were to both end the rebellion in Cuba, and to decrease the Spanish influence on the island while keeping the United States out of the Conflict. These aims combined with the instable nature of the war lead to the measured response by Fish in which he proposed that neutrality should be maintained despite public opinion that strongly deviated towards entering the war. Race also played a key role in Fish's Policy. He feared that overt involvement in the war would bring an influx of Cubans to the United States. He stated: ""Cubans are of a different race and language, unaccustomed to our institutions or self-government; we would not wish to incorporate them with us."" A such Fish maintained a neutral position throughout the war despite anti-American actions taken by Spain such as the executions of Americans by the Spanish Government in the Virginius Affair.",2024-08-18,"['Wikipedia Student Program' 'Cuba–United States relations'

238,31308,5335986,7551,Goose Creek (Potomac River tributary),"Goose Creek is a U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map  , accessed August 15, 2011 tributary of the Potomac River in Fauquier and Loudoun Counties in Northern Virginia. It comprises the principal drainage system for the Loudoun Valley.

Course
Goose Creek rises somewhere near Linden in the Manassas Gap. The creek initially flows eastward down the mountain, falling  in its first . Once in Loudoun, the creek continues in a northeastward direction for  to the western foot of Catoctin Mountain, where it turns to the north briefly, before reaching the confluence of the North Fork and then turning to the east and cutting through a gap in the mountain.  On the east side of the mountain, the creek again turns northeast, joining with the Little River. The creek flows for  through central Loudoun County, reaching the Potomac just east of Leesburg, south of Harrison Island, and west of Selden Island. Goose Creek is partially dammed north of State Route 267. The dammed part is called Goose Creek Reservoir. The dam may be portaged through the woods on the eastern shore. There is also Beaverdam Reservoir, which comes from a source of water called Beaverdam Creek, as said creek branches off of Goose Creek.

North Fork
The North Fork of Goose Creek rises at the east end of Sleeter Lake in Round Hill and flows  in a southeastward direction, joining with the main branch in the water gap of Catoctin Mountain.

Conservation
The Goose Creek Association works to protect the watershed and landscape.

Map of Goose Creek
In 1849, construction began on a system of locks and dams to render the creek navigable up to three large mills in the Loudoun Valley on the Little River, North Fork and main creek bed. Across the Potomac from the mouth of a creek, a special lock on the C&O Canal was constructed to allow canal boats from Goose Creek to enter the canal. By 1845, the Goose Creek and Little River Navigation Company canal system had been completed on Goose Creek to Ball's (Evergreen) Mill,  upstream from the mouth. Due to financial concerns it was decided that the canal would not be built any further upstream.  Though the lower portion of the canal saw significant usage, only one boat was ever known to have traveled the whole stretch, and by 1857 the canal was put out of business by the completion of the Alexandria, Loudoun and Hampshire Railroad to Leesburg.  Most of the locks and dams were destroyed by the Union Army during the Civil War.

Goose Creek Bridge on the Ashby's Gap Turnpike was the site of a Civil War battle in the Loudoun Valley during the Gettysburg Campaign in 1863. (See Battle of Upperville#Goose Creek for details.) The bridge was built between 1801 and 1803 and is the longest remaining stone turnpike bridge in the state of Virginia.

In The Water Dancer, a slave narrative style novel by Ta-Nehisi Coats, the Goose serves as both a water symbol and the geographic location of the fictionalized tobacco farm, Lockless, Virginia.

239,54359,76531141,35834,2024 Hastings Borough Council election,"The 2024 Hastings Borough Council election was held on Thursday 2 May 2024, alongside the other local elections in the United Kingdom being held on the same day. Half of the 32 members of Hastings Borough Council in East Sussex were elected. The council remained under no overall control, but the Green Party made significant gains in their number of seats, becoming the largest party on the council. The  Conservatives performed poorly, losing a third of their 2023 share of the vote and half their seats. Reform UK also lost their only seat, which they had gained in May 2023 following a Conservative Councillor switching parties. The Labour group leader, Heather Bishop, lost her seat.

Prior to the election, the council was being run by a minority coalition of the Green Party and the subset of the independent councillors known as the 'Hastings Independent Group'. Following the election a Green minority administration formed instead.

Background
Hasting historically been controlled by all 3 major parties. The Conservatives first won a majority in 1976, but lost the council to no overall control in 1980. The Liberal Democrats won control in 1996, with the Conservatives having lost all their seats on the council the previous year. The Labour Party won control of the council 2 years later, and held a majority until 2002, with the Conservatives retaking the council in 2006. Labour gained the council in 2010, and controlled the council until 2022. 

In 2022, Labour won 9 seats (down 3) with 42.1% of the vote, the Conservatives won 4 with 29.6%, and the Green Party won 3 (up 3) with 23.5%. Following this election, Labour formed a majority coalition with the Green Party, but later formed a minority administration after the Greens withdrew from the coalition. Labour lost their position as the largest group on the council in December 2023, after the resignation of 8 councillors from Labour and the suspension of another. A minority coalition of the Green Party and the 8 who left Labour was then formed, with a Green Party leader.

The seats up for election in 2024 were last contested in 2021; because of the delay of all local elections due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the seats are up for election after 3 years rather than the usual 4. In that election, the Conservatives won 8 seats (up 4) with 40.7% of the vote, Labour won 7 (down 5) with 37.6%, and the Green party won 1 (up 1) with 16.3%

247,32894,75921746,5756,Lugave Clan,"Lugave Clan is one of the many clans in Buganda Kingdom. Lugave Clan is one of the five clans that were indigenous to Buganda Kingdom before the coming of Ssekabaka Kato Kintu. Lugave is a Luganda word meaning Pangolin. Members who belonged to the five clans are referred to as Bannansangwa who are the originals. The other Bannasangwa Clans are Fumbe, Ngeye, Njaza, and Nnyonyi Nnyange. The head of the Lugave Clan was called Mukiibi Ssebuko Ssalongo, known at the founding of the Buganda Kingdom.

 History 
According to Buganda History, Mukiibi Ssebuko Ssalongo together with his followers played a major role in the forming of the Buganda Kingdom.

Bemba, who is said to have come from the Kiziba area to the southwest of Buganda, invaded and conquered Buganda. He was so cruel and ruthless to his subjects. Mukiibi, who is the Lugave Clan head rebelled against him. This forced Bemba to  take over all of Mukiibi's land and properties sending him together with his followers into exile at the Ssese Islands which was close.

Mukiibi while at Ssese, heard of Kintu's force which was preparing to battle Bemba. He decided to join Kintu's invading force making Kintu glad to receive an addition strengthening his force. Mukiibi and Kintu travelled together to Mangira in Kyaggwe after meeting in Jinja, where the two forces were joined.

The two battle forces were finally joined, with Mukiibi among the top commanders, together with his men (Kigave and Nfudu), they fought hard and succeeded in the capturing and killing of Bemba and beheading him. Kintu became the King after the successful battle which marked the start of the Buganda Kingdom and the establishment of the Royal Dynasty that ruled Buganda since then.

Kintu expressed gratitude to Mukiibi and his followers by giving him the privilege of choosing for himself and his children choice pieces of land anywhere in the Buganda Kingdom where they can settle. Mukiibi was also allowed the privilege of planting fig trees (Mituba) for his children in the places they chose to settle (Planting a fig tree was a symbolic recognition of the granting of ownership to the land). This is one of the reasons why Lugave Clan members are scattered throughout Buganda. Mukiibi himself settled at Kapeeka in Busiro. The Crowning mark of Kintu's gratitude was the choice of Mukiibi's sons to be the very first prime minister known as Katikkiro in the Buganda Kingdom. This is the highest office which a non-royal can rise in the Buganda Hierarchy in the Buganda Kingdom.

Having secured the throne for Kintu, Mukiibi settled in an ordinary life routine. He was an enthusiastic hunter who at one time when he was hunting, he found himself at a place called Ssekiwunga near Katende in Mawokota. The beauty of this place enchanted him so he decided to settle there telling his companions that he wants to be buried there on his death. ""Wano we ndigwa"", meaning ""this is where I finally rest"", became a frequent saying of his and he was named ""Ndigwa"" as a result. The name Ndigwa was altered in speech to become Ndugwa, which is now the official title of the head of the Lugave Clan. The main shrine of the Lugave Clan has remained at Katende, Mawokota up to this day. The Main Clan Motto recalls this, the final resting place of the Clan's founding father.

It is found in the Eastern Mediterranean, specifically along the coasts of the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara in Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. It grows on coastal rocks and occasionally concrete, often in Mediterranean scrub vegetation. 

Taxonomy
The lichen was first formally described as a new species in 2016 by the lichenologists Ivan Frolov, Oleksandr Khodosovtsev, and Jan Vondrák, who placed it in the genus Caloplaca. The type specimen was collected near Gaziköy in a small brook valley at elevations of  above sea level. Frolov and Vondrák later transferred it to genus Pyrenodesmia.

Description
This species of Pyrenodesmia is recognized by several key features: it lacks anthraquinones (common in the family Teloschistaceae), and its thallus, which is usually thinner than 200 μm, does not have a distinct cortex and has a  colouration. The mature apothecia are typically smaller than 0.5 mm in diameter, with a black  with a true, zeorine exciple.

The thallus of Pyrenodesmia micromarina is ochre to grey, occasionally with white spots, and forms small, irregular to roundish spots. It consists of tightly arranged, flat . The medulla is inconspicuous, and the  is made up of spherical cells. The  is usually not developed, but an  cortex might be present with an indistinct boundary. The lichen does not have vegetative diaspores and occasionally has a white , particularly around the apothecia.

Apothecia are small, with a black  and a  that matches the thallus in colour. The hymenium is colourless and may contain stacks of extracellular crystals. The asci are , containing eight , colourless  with rather wide septa.

 are commonly observed, with darker grey tops on the thallus surface. The  are ellipsoid to broadly ellipsoid.

Chemistry
Chemical tests reveal that the thallus and apothecia are negative for potassium hydroxide (K), calcium hypochlorite (C), and p-phenylenediamine (P) reactions and are not fluorescent under ultraviolet light. The  and the outer cells of the  contain , which reacts to water and potassium hydroxide. However, no substances were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography in apothecia and thallus samples.

257,22523,75627433,19490,Battle of Alberta (NHL),"The Battle of Alberta refers to the rivalry between the National Hockey League's Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers. The rivalry is one of the fiercest regional rivalries in league history. Geography plays a heavy role in the rivalry as both teams are located in opposite sides of the Canadian province of Alberta as two teams are based in the cities of Edmonton, the provincial capital, and Calgary, the province's most populous city. Both teams have met in the postseason six times and have combined for six Stanley Cup titles. The Flames lead the regular season record 131–110–18–7, while the Oilers lead the postseason matchups 23–12.

History

Origins
The Oilers were established as a World Hockey Association (WHA) team in 1972 and joined the NHL as a part of the NHL–WHA merger in 1979. They were soon followed by the Atlanta Flames moving to Calgary in 1980, making the question of who would reign as the top team in Alberta a hot topic. The Flames were the higher-ranked squad in their inaugural season, finishing with 39 wins and 92 points and making it to the Stanley Cup semifinals. The following year the Oilers became the dominant franchise when the Oilers shot to the top of the Smythe Division and Wayne Gretzky started his career-long process of shattering over 100 NHL records and milestones.

1980s
The rivalry was especially bitter in the second half of the 1980s. For much of this time, the Flames and Oilers were the two best teams in the Campbell Conference, and by some accounts in the entire league. One of the two teams represented the Campbell Conference in the Stanley Cup Finals for eight consecutive years from  to  (Oilers six times, Flames twice). During this time, the Alberta teams won six of the eight Stanley Cup Championships, including the Oilers winning five Cups, a feat that has not been repeated since. The Edmonton Oilers of 1983–90 are recognized as one of the NHL's last great dynasties, with line-ups through this period that featured Hockey Hall of Fame (HHOF) legends like Gretzky, Glenn Anderson, Paul Coffey, Grant Fuhr, Kevin Lowe, Jari Kurri and Mark Messier, guided by HHOF coach Glen Sather. The 1984–85 Oilers would be voted as the greatest NHL team of all-time during the league's 2017 centennial celebrations. The only time the Flames won the Stanley Cup during that period was in , led by HHOF superstars Lanny McDonald, Doug Gilmour, Al MacInnis, Joe Mullen and Joe Nieuwendyk. This period of repeated confrontations was mainly due to the way the playoffs were structured for much of this time. The top four teams in each division made the playoffs, and the winners of the divisional rounds met in the conference finals. As the Flames and Oilers were both in the Smythe Division, this made it very likely they would face each other in the first or second round, en route to the conference finals. That same system made it a near-certainty that all other playoff qualifiers in the Campbell Conference faced the nearly unachievable (during that eight-year period) task of having to get past either the Oilers or Flames (or both) to make the Stanley Cup Finals. During this run, the Stanley Cup was awarded in Alberta from  to  (Oilers winning the deciding Cup game against the Prince of Wales Conference champion in Edmonton in 1984, , , and 1988, while the east's Montreal Canadiens won the deciding game in Calgary in ).

The Oilers defeated the Flames in the playoffs in 1983, 1984, 1988, and 1991, on their way to two of their five Stanley Cups. The Flames defeated the Oilers in the 1986 NHL playoffs; game seven was decided when rookie Oiler defenceman Steve Smith accidentally scored on his own goal, which pushed the rivalry to a new level. The Flames were favoured in the 1988 playoffs, winning the Presidents' Trophy, but the Oilers swept the series and eventually went on to win the Cup.

1990s
After their opening round matchup in 1991, the two teams did not meet again in the playoffs until 2022. The Oilers, the 1990 Stanley Cup champions, had finished 20 points behind the Flames, the 1989 Stanley Cup champions. Despite this, the Oilers were able to push the series to seven games, with Esa Tikkanen leading the underdog Oilers to an overtime victory on his third goal of the game.

Due to the sheer talent and skill exhibited by both teams in the mid to late-1980s, Alberta was considered a ""Death Valley"" for teams coming to play on a road trip. The honing of skills developed by the Oilers and Flames by playing the ""other"" best team in the NHL this many times a year made a swing through Alberta quite daunting for the rest of the teams in the league. The two Alberta teams showed their collective domination over the other 19 teams in the NHL by finishing a joint first and second in the Smythe Division six times between the 1982–83 and 1989–90 regular seasons (neither team lower than third in the nine seasons from 1981 to 1982 through 1990–91), finishing a joint first and second in the larger Clarence Campbell Conference four times between the 1985–86 and 1989–90 regular seasons (neither team lower than fifth from 1981 to 1982 through 1990–91) and finishing with both teams in the top ten of the entire NHL seven times between the 1983–84 and 1989–90 regular seasons (with both teams in the top five of the entire NHL in four of those seasons). At least one of the two Alberta teams finished first or second overall for the entire NHL in every one of those nine seasons.

With the changes to the regular season schedule from the 1991–92 NHL season onwards, the two teams no longer played each other eight times a year. Falling to only four times a year by 2016–17, except for the 2020–21 NHL season where they played ten times due to play exclusively against Canadian NHL teams due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes in the playoff format also reduced the opportunities for the two teams to meet in the intensity of a condensed seven-game series in less than two weeks — as they went 31 years between playoff meetings after the 1991 series. As the NHL expanded in the United States, Canada declined from seven of 21 league teams in 1990–91 to six of 30 by the 2000–01 NHL season. The two Alberta franchises faced financial hardships, since they were among the smallest markets in the league, restricting their ability to pay for higher quality talent and further reducing the competitiveness of the Battle of Alberta games and their ability to reach the playoffs. The situation was not addressed until June 2005, when the NHL became the last major North American professional sports league to introduce a salary cap, coupled with improved revenue sharing.

2000s
It took well over a decade for either team to return to anything near the form they had exhibited in the 1980s. The Flames advanced to the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals, falling in seven games to the Tampa Bay Lightning. The Flames became the first team in the modern era of the NHL to defeat all three division winners en route to the Stanley Cup Finals. The next Stanley Cup Finals, (played in  due to the NHL lock-out of 2004–05) saw the Edmonton Oilers fall in seven games to the Carolina Hurricanes. The Oilers became the first eighth seed in NHL history to advance past the semifinals, let alone make it to the Stanley Cup Finals. The Oilers faced a playoff drought for ten seasons after their run in 2006–07, not qualifying for the playoffs until the 2016–17 season. The Flames made the playoffs every year until 2009, but then had their own playoff drought of six consecutive seasons.

There have been three regular season sweeps in the history of the rivalry. The Flames swept the six-game series in 2009–10 and the five-game series in 2014–15, while the Oilers swept the four-game series in 2016–17. The Flames’ sweep of the Oilers in 2009–10 was significant in the sense that they tied the rivalry's win–loss–tie overall regular season and playoff series (since the team's move to Calgary) on December 28, 2009. They then took the overall series lead with their victory over the Oilers three days later, and they have not relinquished it since (as of the end of the 2019–20 season). The Oilers had previously led the series since October 20, 1981. The aforementioned 2009–10 season also marked the first-ever trade between the two rivals, with Edmonton's Steve Staios being traded for Calgary's Aaron Johnson on March 3, 2010.

2020s
The rivalry saw a large revival in early 2020. During a game on January 11, 2020, Calgary's Matthew Tkachuk and Edmonton's Zack Kassian began a feud. It began with two hits that Kassian felt were ""predatory"" in nature from Tkachuk, including a hit that knocked off Kassian's helmet. In response, Kassian attempted to fight Tkachuk, grabbing and punching him. Tkachuk did not fight back and assumed a defensive position, leading Kassian to be given a double-minor penalty for roughing and a misconduct. On the ensuing power play, Calgary scored the game-winning goal. After the game, Tkachuk's decision to ""turtle"" stirred controversy among players, fans, and sports writers. The teams met again on January 29, which saw Tkachuk and Kassian fight near the end of the first period, with Kassian saying “Thanks kid, I appreciate you doing this."" In the next game on February 1, the first goalie fight between the two teams erupted, in the midst of a full line brawl. It was considered by many fans as the epitome of the battle of Alberta, with Oilers radio announcer Jack Michaels saying, ""This is the battle of Alberta we've been waiting for, for three decades!"" during his coverage of the game.

During the 2022 playoffs, the Edmonton Oilers and Calgary Flames faced off in the second round. Both the Flames and Oilers narrowly won their previous rounds, both of which went to game seven. Game one set the tone for the rest of the series with a record-setting high-scoring game, which ended in a Flames 9–6 victory. The Oilers then won the next four games, with players such as the Oilers' Evander Kane scoring multiple goals, along with a hat-trick. In game five, both teams scored in total four goals in 71 seconds, bringing the score to 4–4 at the end of the second period. In the third period, a controversial goal by Flames player Blake Coleman was called off for being knocked in with a kicking motion, resulting in the game remaining tied. The game went to overtime where Oilers' star player, Connor McDavid, scored from a quick snapshot five minutes in. The Oilers advanced to the Western Conference finals for the first time since 2006, but they were swept by the Colorado Avalanche.

The two teams met at the 2023 Heritage Classic in Edmonton on October 29, 2023, with the Oilers defeating the Flames 5–2.",2025-04-08,"['History of the Edmonton Oilers' 'Calgary Flames'

This group was formed by former National Hockey League player Anson Carter, in order to bring an NHL team back to Atlanta for the first time since the Atlanta Thrashers relocated to Winnipeg in 2011.

History
Background
In 2011, after years of ownership issues and bad management, the Atlanta Thrashers were bought by True North Sports and Entertainment and relocated to Winnipeg, becoming the second interation of the Winnipeg Jets.

8 years after the Thrashers relocation, in 2019, former NHL player Anson Carter met with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman to begin talks on bringing the NHL back to Atlanta. However, in the past few years,  rumors of Atlanta returning to the NHL began to heat up with the ECHL's Atlanta Gladiators drawing over 10,000 fans for Thrashers Night. A competing bid, led by metro Atlanta businessman Vernon Krause and based in Forsyth County, announced their intentions to get an NHL team in the area with a brand new arena, The Gathering at South Forsyth.

Formation
On March 12, 2024, Carter officially announced the creation of Alpharetta Sports and Entertainment and that they had sent a request to the NHL to begin the expansion process.

262,42244,76185150,5123,April 2021 Mediterranean shipwreck,"On April 22, 2021, a boat carrying around 130 migrants of sub-Saharan origin sank off the coast of Libya. The disaster led to the death of all the people sailing on the small boat.

 Situation 
On April 23, 2021, the NGO SOS Méditerranée, based in Marseille, informed the media that it had spotted around ten bodies off the coast of Libya near an overturned inflatable boat which had already been reported in distress. The boat carried 130 people on board. No survivors were found during the search operations carried out by the ship Ocean Viking, chartered by this NGO, as well as three merchant ships.

The NGO Alarm Phone blames this sinking on the European side denying responsibility for the boat, and the incompetence of the coast guards.

 Consequences 
This tragedy increases the human death toll from shipwrecks in the central Mediterranean. According to the International Organization for Migration, at least 355 people had already been known to have lost their lives in this maritime zone in 2021. Adding the people missing as a result of this shipwreck, the cumulative death toll is 453 migrants.

 Reactions 
The French NGO SOS Méditerranée accused the European Union and Libya by issuing this statement: “States are abdicating their responsibility to coordinate search and rescue operations, leaving private actors and civil society to fill the deadly void they leave behind them. We can see the result of this deliberate inaction in the sea around us.""

According to Pope Francis, “One hundred and thirty migrants died in the sea. They are persons, human lives, who for two entire days implored in vain for help, help that didn’t arrive. Let us pray for these brothers and sisters, let us interrogate all of ourselves about this latest tragedy. It is a moment of shame.""

266,48478,76379532,8735,Sigrid Jacobeit,"Sigrid Jacobeit (née Dorow; born 29 January 1940) is a German ethnographer and ethnologist and agricultural scientist. She was director of the Ravensbrück Concentration Camp Memorial of the Brandenburg Memorials Foundation from 1992 to 2005.

 Life and research 
Jacobeit was born on 29 January 1940 in Johannismühle near Baruth/Mark. After graduating from high school in Luckenwalde in 1958, she began studying agriculture at Humboldt University in East Berlin (1959–1965). In 1971, Jacobeit took over the management of the Museum of Agricultural Productive Forces in Wandlitz from Walter Blankenburg, which she ran until 1980. At the same time, she completed a correspondence course in ethnography/history at the Humboldt University (1971–1975). In 1979 she completed her doctorate on Working and Living Conditions of Small and Medium-Sized Women Farmers in the Nazi Era. After working as a freelance author from 1980 to 1985, she taught from 1986 to 1991 as a research assistant and senior assistant at the Institute for Ethnography at the Humboldt University. In 1990 she habilitated as Dr. sc. phil. at the Humboldt University. The title of her dissertation is: Die Grundbedürfnisse Ernährung und Kleidung im Alltag des deutschen Volkes zwischen 1800 und 1945.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall, university life changed fundamentally. This led to new appointments to the chairs and ended her teaching activities at the university. From 1991, she received teaching assignments at Technische Universität Berlin and Free University of Berlin. She has also taught at the universities in Luxembourg, Jena, Novosibirsk, Zurich and TU Dortmund University. She has given numerous lectures and interviews in Germany and abroad, as well as in the United States. In 2002, she was appointed honorary professor by Humboldt University and continues her academic work to this day.

In collaboration with her husband, the chronicler, historian and ethnologist Wolfgang Jacobeit, she wrote and published three volumes of the Illustrated Everyday History of the German People between 1986 and 1995, an autobiographical work about Wolfgang Stegemann and other works. She researched women's history in general, compiled biographies on women in the resistance before and during National Socialism and wrote a study on the Osram workers in war production during World War II. In 1987, she and Liselotte Thomas-Heinrich published their joint work Kreuzweg Ravensbrück - Lebensbilder antifaschistischer Widerstandskämpferinnen.

Jacobeit co-founded the Interdisciplinary Women's Research Group Ravensbrück Memorial - FU Berlin (IFFG), which was awarded the Margherita von Brentano Prize in 1997. Through close cooperation between the Ravensbrück Memorial and the Free University of Berlin, the IFFG has created important conditions for research and teaching about the Ravensbrück women's concentration camp in various academic fields. At the time of the award ceremony, Birgit Bosold, Elisabeth Böhmer, Insa Eschebach, Ursula Fuhrich-Grubert, Johanna Kootz, Irmela von der Lühe and Claudia Ulbrich were are part of this group. In 1997, the IFFG research project Victims and survivors. Jewish Women Prisoners in Ravensbrück Concentration Camp during and after World War II was presented. This project was carried out in cooperation with the University of Tel Aviv until December 1999. 7]

Sigrid Jacobeit is a founding member and former chairwoman of the Folklore Section of the Gesellschaft für Ethnographie e. V. . In 2007, together with Henry Tesch, she founded the International Summerschool at Gymnasium Carolinum in Neustrelitz with the support of Eike Benzin, teacher at the Carolinum, and Ulrich Meßner, director of the Müritz National Park.

 Ravensbrück Memorial 
Sigrid Jacobeit took office as director of the Ravensbrück Memorial, the largest women's concentration camp in the German Reich between 1939 and 1945, in December 1992. She had previously been deputy director of the Museum of Labor in Hamburg from 1991 to 1992. Jacobeit facilitated the reorientation and extensive redesign of the memorial site in cooperation with those responsible in the state of Brandenburg. She was also a member of the International Ravensbrück Committee. She succeeded in establishing personal connections with survivors of the Ravensbrück women's, men's and youth concentration camp from numerous European countries and internationally, and in an intensive exchange of ideas, she learned about their ideas for the redesign and further development of the memorial. Jacobeit retired at the end of May 2005. Her successor as director of the Ravensbrück Memorial was Insa Eschebach.

The Ravensbrück Summer University was jointly launched in 2005 by Sigrid Jacobeit and the historian Stefan Hördler with the support of Johanna Wanka, Brandenburg's Minister of Science, Research and Culture at the time.

267,6520,75153040,6195,1959 Canberra shootdown,"The Canberra shootdown incident occurred on 10 April 1959, when an English Electric Canberra B(I)58 of the Indian Air Force was shot down by an F-86F Sabre of the Pakistan Air Force over Rawat, near Rawalpindi while performing a aerial reconnaissance mission. This incident is regarded as the first aerial kill of the Pakistan Air Force.

Incident
Because it was Eid al-Fitr most PAF personnel had been given the day off, with only a skeleton crew, mostly comprising unmarried officers and airmen, on duty. The Indian Canberra entered Pakistani airspace while on an aerial reconnaissance mission. Pakistani radar had detected that an intruder had flown in from Indian airspace, heading towards Gujrat, Pakistan. Repeated warnings were issued to the intruder to land at Gujrat, where it was spotted. Two F-86F Sabres flown by Flt. Lt. M. N. Butt and Flt. Lt. M. Yunis were scrambled from PAF Base Peshawar to intercept it. Flt. Lt. M. N. Butt attempted to bring down the Canberra by firing his  machine guns, but the Canberra was flying at an altitude of more than , beyond the operational ceiling of the F-86F. When Yunis took over, the Canberra suddenly lost height while executing a turn over Rawalpindi. Yunis fired a burst from his guns which hit the Canberra at an altitude of  and brought it down over Rawat. Both crew members of the IAF Canberra Sqn Ldr J.C. Sengupta, and Flt Lt S.N. Rampal ejected and were captured by Pakistani authorities. They were subsequently released and repatriated a day later after remaining in detention for some time.

Claims
Pakistan claims that the mission of the Canberra was to take aerial photographs of strategic installations between Lahore and Rawalpindi and that the Canberra had been warned both by hand-signals and warning shots in front of the plane. The Foreign Office of Pakistan published a press note allegedly with a written statement of Sqn. Ldr. J.C. Sengupta, which revealed the hostile nature of his mission to graph certain military targets in Pakistan. The press note emphasized the fact that the incident took place on the Eid when the Indian Air Force expected that the Pakistani defence personnel, like the rest of the nation, would be celebrating Eid and it would consequently make their espionage mission less risky and more promising on that day. 

Indian Defence Minister, V. K. Krishna Menon and Indian Ambassador to the U.S. M. C. Chagla, claim that the Canberra was on a routine operational flight to photograph Indian territory in Himachal Pradesh and Kashmir and that it must have strayed over to Pakistan due to a navigational error, which was easy to do at a height of fifty thousand feet. The claim also alleges that no warning was given before the Canberra was shot down.",2025-04-21,"['Aircraft shootdown incidents in the Indo-Pakistani wars'

269,9210,75227639,21016,Self-Portrait Dedicated to Leon Trotsky,"Self-Portrait Dedicated to Leon Trotsky, also known as Between the Curtains, is a 1937 painting by Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, given to Leon Trotsky on his birthday and the 20th anniversary of the October Revolution. Kahlo and her husband, artist Diego Rivera, had convinced government officials to allow Trotsky and his second wife, Natalia Sedova, to live in exile in Mexico. The Russian couple moved into the Blue House (La Casa Azul), where they resided for two years.

Soon after the couples met, Kahlo and Trotsky began showing affection towards each other. A brief affair occurred, but ended by July 1937. A few months later, she presented Trotsky with a self-portrait dedicated to him, which he hung in his study. When Trotsky was assassinated in 1940, Kahlo was heartbroken and planned to destroy the painting. A friend who was visiting at the time, Clare Boothe Luce, convinced her not to do so and acquired the painting herself.

In 1988, Luce donated the painting to Wilhelmina Holladay, co-founder of the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C. Since that time, it has become one of the museum's most popular works. It is also the only Kahlo painting in a Washington, D.C., museum's permanent collection. 

Background
Inspiration for the painting
Frida Kahlo (1907–1954) was a Mexican painter whose works, including many self-portraits, made her a symbol of Mexican culture, feminism, and LGBT culture. Many of her surrealist works depict moments in her life, often tragic ones, due to her tumultuous marriage to artist Diego Rivera and her recurring health issues. Around a third of her paintings are self-portraits, which often symbolize her painful experiences. Kahlo's personal life and her artwork were heavily influenced by the Mexicanidad movement, which seeks to revitalize the culture of Mexico's indigenous peoples.On January 9, 1937, Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky and his second wife, Natalia Sedova, arrived in Tampico, Mexico, after living in exile for several years due to Joseph Stalin's success in ousting him from power. Rivera was a Communist who, along with Kahlo, convinced President Lázaro Cárdenas to allow Trotsky into Mexico. The couple welcomed Trotsky to take up residence in their Blue House (La Casa Azul), located in the Coyoacán neighborhood of Mexico City. Trotsky and Sedova would end up living in the house until April 1939 when Rivera and Trotsky's friendship ended.

Kahlo and Rivera's relationship was often fraught. They divorced and then remarried, and each had lovers. Rivera slept with Kahlo's sister for several years and Kahlo had several woman lovers. The couple became good friends with Trotsky, although Sedova was not as close since she did not speak English. Trotsky and Kahlo's attraction towards each other occurred shortly after the couples met. He would leave letters to Kahlo inside books she borrowed, and they would meet in a nearby friend's house. Calling Trotsky ""The Old Man"" (El Viejo), Kahlo was attracted to his resilience in the face of persecution and his revolutionary ideas. 

By July 1937, their affair ended and Trotsky and Rivera soon reconciled. Weeks later, Trotsky wrote to Sedova ""She is nothing to me."" In October 1937, she gave Trotsky Self-Portrait Dedicated to Leon Trotsky, which was also called Between the Curtains. By the following year, thanks in part to André Breton and Jacqueline Lamba's visit to Mexico where they saw Kahlo's work, Kahlo's first major exhibition took place overseas.

Acquisition and display

Wilhelmina Holladay, co-founder along with her husband of the National Museum of Women in the Arts (NMWA) in Washington, D.C., received the painting as a donation from writer and politician Clare Boothe Luce. While visiting Kahlo in Mexico City in 1940, Luce convinced Kahlo not to destroy the painting after she had learned of Trotsky's assassination. Luce was given the painting, and in 1988, gave it to Holladay during a visit to Luce's Watergate apartment. Since receiving the painting, it has become one of the museum's most famous works. It has been loaned to exhibitions at the Inter-American Development Bank's cultural center, the National Gallery of Australia, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection. The latter focused on the works of Kahlo, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Emily Carr, representing Mexico, the United States, and Canada, respectively.        

In 2007, the NMWA presented an exhibition on Kahlo's work. In addition to Self-Portrait Dedicated to Leon Trotsky, there were photographs and private letters available for viewing. Additional activities included learning Mexican dances, viewing the film ""The Life and Times of Frida Kahlo"", and watching the Maru Montero Dance Company perform. In the early 2020s, the NMWA underwent a $67.5 million renovation. During that time, Self-Portrait Dedicated to Leon Trotsky and ten other paintings were loaned to the National Gallery of Art. The museum reopened in October 2023 with Self-Portrait Dedicated to Leon Trotsky returning as a centerpiece of the NMWA's collection. It is the only Kahlo painting in a Washington, D.C., museum's permanent collection.

Description
The oil on masonite painting measures 30 inches tall and 24 inches wide (76.2 cm × 60.96 cm). Kahlo stands poised and confident in the painting. Its setting is inspired by retablos, devotional paintings of religious figures. It depicts Kahlo standing between two white curtains on a stage, holding a letter to Trotsky and a bouquet of flowers. The letter reads ""To Leon Trotsky with great affection, I dedicate this painting November 7, 1937. Frida Kahlo. In San Angel. Mexico.""(Para Leon Trotsky con todo cariño, dedico esta pintura el dia 7 de Noviembre de 1937. Frida Kahlo. En San Angel. México.) The date is not only Trotsky's birthday, but the 20-year anniversary of the October Revolution, .

Her outfit consists of a dress worn by Zapotec women from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and was considered to be more subdued compared to other self-portraits. Her top consisted of a huipil, a commonly worn item amongst indigenous women in Mexico and Central America, which is red with green trimming. The huipil also features a bejeweled pendant, though her beige rebozo, similar to a shawl that symbolizes womanhood, covers most of the top. White trimming and white flowers also embroider her coral pink enaguas (petticoat). Kahlo's hairstyle resembles that of women from the Tehuantepec region, being braided and adorned with a pink flower and red ribbon. She is wearing gold earrings and makeup, including bright red lipstick and pink rouge, as well as red fingernail polish. She also has one ring on her right hand.

Analysis
According to Josefina De La Torre from the Fashion Institute of Technology, ""her ensemble blends late-30s beauty trends with traditional clothing."" Hank Burchard writing in The Washington Post described Kahlo's expression as ""solemn bordering on baleful"", but also ""hard and respectful."" Burchard interpreted the painting as a way of Kahlo showing her survival instinct in an art world dominated by men, including her own husband. Sarah Milroy from The Globe and Mail wrote that the painting demonstrates Kahlo's satisfaction with the affair she had with Trotsky, but noting the overall tone is tame compared to her other works.

In 1938, Breton wrote about how deeply moved he was by the painting:
""I have for long admired the self-portrait by Frida Kahlo de Rivera that hangs on a wall of Trotsky's study. She has painted herself dressed in a robe of wings gilded with butterflies, and it is exactly in this guise that she draws aside the mental curtain. We are privileged to be present, as in the most glorious days of German romanticism, at the entry of a young woman endowed with all the gifts of seduction.""

Because Kahlo destroyed all other evidence of her and Trotsky's affair, the painting is the only tangible evidence it took place. Author and historian Hayden Herrera believes Kahlo gave the painting as a way of teasing Trotsky, especially by being dressed ""fit to kill"" along with wearing makeup. Another historian who specializes in Kahlo's life, Robin Richmond, has a different view. He thinks that Kahlo is dressed quite conservatively, and it was a way of her vying for Trotsky's attention. Richmond also thinks she was portraying another version of herself, and that the painting is ""quite terrifying"" because she was being calculative with its intent.

In her book, Devouring Frida: The Art History and Popular Celebrity of Frida Kahlo, Margaret Lindauer writes these type of opinions are judging the painting by her looks. Richmond also considers Kahlo's infatuation with Trotsky more as a hero figure, rather than as a revolutionary, perhaps because she was too naïve to understand the facets of Trotskyism. Meanwhile, Trotsky is viewed as a towering figure and powerful man. The fact Kahlo added the date of the October Revolution on her painting suggests she was very aware of his political views, and supported them herself.",2025-03-11,"['1937 paintings' 'Cultural depictions of Leon Trotsky'

279,13680,75369201,13087,Tu Pug Imatuy,"Tu Pug Imatuy (; Japanese: 殺人の権利) is a 2017 Filipino drama film directed by Arnel Barbarona, produced by Red Motion Media and distributed by Solar Entertainment. The film stars Jong Monzon and Malona Sulatan in lead roles and had its world premiere at the 30th Tokyo International Film Festival on 26 October 2017. Inspired by actual events, the drama tackles the struggle of indigenous Manobos against environmental plunder and the militarization of their communities.

Synopsis
Set in a community in the hinterlands in Mindanao, the film follows an indigenous couple whose displaced lives are compromised with their relation to the military.

Obunay and Dawin are a young indigenous Manobo couple in Mindanao who raise their three children through hunting and farming. The death of their young infant child leads to events that put their lives and their community in danger. After burying their child, Dawin learns from the village chieftain that soldiers are forcing him to accept the mining project that is destroying other communities. Dawin later encounters a squad of soldiers who pry him away from his children. Obunay is also captured later.

The couple are forced to act as guides in the soldiers' pursuit of armed rebels. They reach a Lumad school where the soldiers hostage the teachers and the community members, suspecting they are communist sympathizers. Obunay springs a plot to help the teacher and community escape. But they were caught again by the soldiers, leading to the tragic killing of Dawin.

Obunay tries to escape as soldiers were caught in a gunfire with the actual rebels. As one military squad kept chasing her, the widow leads them to the hole meant for wild boars. Obunay's act of killing is one of seeking justice.

Production
According to the filmmaker, creating the movie was not easy due to budget constraints. Notably, the main characters were played by amateurs who had their first time acting in a full-length feature. The movie was inspired by Barbarona's experience making documentary of the Manobo evacuees from Talaingod in 2014.

Barbarona said ""I think the issues are somewhat universal in terms of land rights and the destruction of the Earth and our natural world. There's an influx of mining in country without really thinking what will happen tomorrow, what will happen to the indigenous people who are living on this land. Capitalism, I think, is the problem. This was one of the messages I wanted to convey. I want there to be peace talks in the Philippines.""

The film's credits indicate that its storyline is based on true events that unfolded in the hinterlands of Mindanao. It shows 
a scene of an elderly Manobo woman named Ubunay Botod Manlaon from Sitio Bagang. She recounts her humiliating treatment by the military as she was forced to act as their guide.

Release
Tu Pug Imatuy was first shown at Cinematheque Davao on March 7 and 8, 2017. Its theatrical release followed after.

It premiered in the 2017 Sinag Maynila Independent Film Festival where it won six major awards. In 2018, it was nominated for the Star Awards for Movies and Television by the Philippine Movie Press Club. It also earned a special Grand Jury Prize for Outstanding Film at the 2018 FAMAS Award.

The film was screened in the Special Features section at the 2018 Pista ng Pelikula Pilipino organized by the Film Development Council of the Philippines.

Reception
Film reviews noted the movie's ""raw beauty"" and ""painfully lyrical images"" amid the beautiful visuals of forests and waterfalls that contrast sharply to the horrors of the characters that encounter torture and fear.

Film critic Skilty Labastilla wrote ""The film makes up for in honesty in storytelling and in imbuing its characters with quiet dignity in the face of harrowing abuse.""

In 2021, Tu Pug Imatuy was included in the Gawad Dekada Para sa Natatanging Pelikula (2010-2019) (Best Film of the Decade) by the  Gawad Urian.

282,45496,5374224,4098,KAFM,"KAFM (88.1 FM) is a volunteer-oriented community radio station located in Grand Junction, Colorado, United States. As with most public stations, a significant share of the station's revenues are derived from member support.

History
Grand Valley Public Radio Company (GVPRC) incorporated on June 22, 1992. The first board of directors included Mickey Krakowski, Martin Krakowski, Marilyn Jones, Greg Jouflas, Char Shoffner, Elizabeth Thompson and Peter Trosclair. On April 12, 1994, the FCC granted a license to GVPRC for 88.1 at 16 watts and assigned call letters KAFM.

In mid-1995, KAFM filed an application with the FCC to transmit at 46,000 watts at 100.7, asking the FCC to allow KAFM to swap frequencies in accordance with FCC rules. In January 1996, the FCC denied KAFM's request but decided to open up 100.7 for operation. The next year, KAFM and 12 other broadcast entities, including Colorado Public Radio (CPR) and almost every Grand Junction commercial broadcaster, applied for 100.7, leading the FCC to freeze the process while it determined how to proceed.

In 1997, KAFM negotiated with KCIC, 88.5, to move to 88.7, thereby allowing both stations to raise power levels but in 1998, the existence of the CPR station in Montrose, KPRH, precluded the deal with KCIC, and KAFM was stuck at 16 watts.  In mid-1998, the FCC told all 100.7 applicants to decide who would get the new frequency or it would auction off the frequency to the highest bidder and put the funds into the FCC budget.  In a unique situation, all 100.7 applicants agreed to hold a private auction and split the funds among the losing bidders, with bidding to increase in $5,000 increments. The auction resulted in a price tag of $440,000 for the 100.7 license. KAFM received 1/11th of the proceeds after expenses, amounting to approximately $40,000.

In mid-1998, the KAFM board decided to put 88.1 on the air at 16 watts, not knowing how many listeners would be able to receive the station or support it.  Transmitter facilities were constructed on Black Ridge in 1998, and the original studio facilities on West Independent were constructed in 1999. KAFM went on the air March 5, 1999.

In November 2001, KAFM moved to 1310 Ute Avenue, purchasing its current building after their landlord decided to triple the rent for its original studios. In 2004. KAFM received funding to build Studio D, a volunteer-run recording and sound studio for the Radio Room, an 80-person concert hall in their new building. KAFM began monthly Radio Room concerts, highlighting local musicians and national acts.",2025-02-02,"['Radio stations in Colorado'

285,53864,76517898,5612,Autoslalom,"Autoslalom (auto slalom, slalom) is a form of motorsport that takes place on short, temporary courses marked out on areas of sealed-surfaces such as car parks or disused airport runways. Competitors are timed to complete the course, with penalties given for diverting from the route or for touching the course markers. Each competitor starts individually and speeds are kept low to emphasise safety and to require good vehicle control.

Autoslalom is a constituent discipline of the international FIA Motorsport Games. There is also a European Autoslalom Championship for international competition.

In United States, slalom, along with autocross, is an optional discipline of the Sports Car Club of America's Solo series. The differences between slalom and autocross have been described as slalom being a high speed parking-lot event, whereas autocross has higher speed on longer courses although the terms may be used interchangeably. The official rules also determine that the disciplines are similar, and that a slalom may also be the name of a section of an autocross course.

It is similar to autotesting in the United Kingdom, motorkhana in Australia and New Zealand, and autokhana in India.

 General rules 

Courses are set out with traffic cones or pylons and may be placed on a mark to be clear where it has been hit by a competitor. Hitting a pylon is one way to score penalties, another is by getting the route incorrect. Competitors may be permitted to walk the course before competition starts, practice runs may be allowed or alternatively, a diagram of the course may be provided by the organiser. It may be a requirement to learn the course before starting with no directional signs or advice available.

Autoslaloms are usually forwards-direction only, unlike autotesting which includes reversing, and don't require loss of traction skills such as doughnuts or drifting. Some require garaging, which includes parking in a box of pylons.

There are very little restrictions on the types of cars that can be used. Though competition prepared cars may be used, drivers may be able to use their production road cars that they arrive to the event in. Some motorsport governing bodies allow participation without a motorsport license, or a free license.

 FIA Motorsport Games 
Auto Slalom was included to the schedule of events of the Motorsport Games for the first time at the second games held in 2022 in Marseille, France. All cars were electric and identical in the form of the Opel Corsa eRally, and teams of male and female drivers both took on the course representing their nation. Auto slalom is planned to return for the third Motorsport Games in 2024, held in Valencia, Spain, within a category called Electric Street which also includes karting slalom.",2024-07-22,['Motorsport by type'],"['motorsport' 'FIA Motorsport Games' ""Sports Car Club of America's""

288,60217,76748936,18293,Characters of Dragon Quest IV,"Enix's role-playing video game Dragon Quest IV (DQIV), features eight permanent player characters in the Nintendo Entertainment System version, and nine in the PlayStation and Nintendo DS versions. The chapter structure of DQIV results in a new set of characters being controlled in each chapter; it is not until the fifth chapter that the Hero becomes the controllable protagonist.  

The cast was designed by Akira Toriyama, who served as art designer for the Dragon Quest series. In addition to the nine main characters, there are various helper characters who have temporary stints with the party and then leave after the plot advances.  Many non-player characters populate the world of DQIV as well.  Most notably, the protagonists are out to stop the villainous Psaro, who plans to get revenge on humanity by resurrecting the Ruler of Evil.

Main characters
Hero

The Hero is the protagonist of the game, and can be male or female. More unique differences were planned for the male and female Heroes due to demand from Dragon Quest III players, but this was neglected after creator Yuji Horii forgot. In the original version on Nintendo Entertainment System, they could be named at the beginning, but did not appear until Chapter 5. In later versions, a prologue is added that has the player controlling them briefly before Chapter 1. They later appear in Chapter 5 as the starring character. In this chapter, Psaro's army destroys the village in the pursuit of the Hero, killing everyone except the Hero, including their friend Eliza who disguises herself as the Hero to keep the Hero safe. They venture out into the world, gathering various allies in their quest to defeat Psaro.

Ragnar McRyan

Ragnar McRyan (Ragnar in the NES version) is the first playable character in the NES version of Dragon Quest IV. He is sent by his king to investigate the disappearance of children from a nearby village, allying with a Cureslime named Healie along the way. He discovers that a demon has been kidnapping children to kill them as an attempt to potentially kill the chosen one. Ragnar kills this demon and rescues the remaining children before being sent to track down the Hero in order to assist him in his quest to defeat Psaro.

Alena

Alena is a princess and the star of the second chapter. She sneaks out, accompanied by her retainers Kiryl and Borya, in order to go on an adventure and become a warrior despite her father's wishes. She eventually enters an arena and participates as a fighter, winning by default after another combatant, Psaro, fails to show. Upon returning to the castle, she finds that the castle is empty, going with Kiryl and Borya to discover the truth of the occupants' absence. She eventually joins with the Hero after they help her and Borya heal Kiryl from a fever, assisting them in defeating Psaro.

Kiryl and Borya
Kiryl and Borya are two of Alena's retainers who accompany her on her quest to explore the world. They believe that she would not obey her father and remain behind, and thus would be safer if they went with her. In Chapter 5, Kiryl becomes deathly ill, forcing Alena to search for a cure. Once the cure is found, Kiryl accompanies Alena and Borya in joining the Hero in their quest to defeat Psaro.

Kiryl's AI was commonly criticized for using ineffective spells in battle, such as spells that are meant to cause instant death, even if the spells could not possibly work. Excite writer Bergman Tagata noted that this quirk about Kiryl was annoying due also to his propensity to use it on weaker enemies as well, stating that this occurs because the AI does not have information about the enemy, and only learns after fighting them. Because boss characters are fought only once, he explained that Kiryl doesn't have any opportunity to put that knowledge to use.

Torneko

Torneko is a merchant, and the star of the third chapter. He does not have strong fighting capabilities, and his story involves him establishing his own business. Along the way, he helps create a bridge and a tunnel, as well as avert a war between two kingdoms. He eventually joins the Hero in their quest to defeat Psaro. Torneko went on to star in multiple spin-off titles, including as part of the Mystery Dungeon spin-off Torneko's Great Adventure.

Maya and Meena

Maya and Meena are sisters, a dancer and fortune teller respectively, who serve as the lead characters for the fourth chapter. They are investigating the murder of their father, eventually discovering that he was researching something called the Secret of Evolution, and was killed for it by his apprentice Balzack. They eventually join the Hero, killing Balzack and assisting the Hero in defeating Psaro.

Antagonists

Psaro is the main antagonist of the story, with his goal being to get revenge on humankind for perceived atrocities, including the abuse of his love, Rose, an elf whose tears are made of ruby. He and his minions kidnap and kill children in order to prevent the rise of the Legendary Hero, though the true Hero ends up surviving the attack on their village. As part of his plan, he is also seeking to master the Secret of Evolution, which would give him incredible power. Following the assassination of Rose, orchestrated by Aamon, he goes mad, turning into a monster and becoming defeated by the hero. In later versions of the game, Rose can be revived, allowing the player to spare him, at which point he joins the party in killing Aamon.

Aamon
Aamon (Dragon Warrior IV: Radimvice) is a minion of Psaro's, one who manipulates Psaro into doing things to serve his own ends. Aamon eventually helps cause the death of Rose, Psaro's love, which results in Psaro losing control and going on a rampage, allowing Aamon to take over as leader of the monsters. He becomes the main antagonist after defeating Psaro in the Nintendo DS version of Dragon Quest IV after Rose is revived and Psaro is pacified.

Other appearances
Various characters in Dragon Quest IV make appearances in other games in different capacities. In Dragon Quest Heroes: The World Tree's Woe and the Blight Below and Dragon Quest Heroes II features multiple characters as playable characters, as does Dragon Quest Tact, Dragon Quest Walk, and the Itadaki Street series.

A manga anthology titled Dragon Quest 4 Panel Manga Theater was created, featuring the cast of Dragon Quest IV. Multiple manga authors contributed to the anthology, including Ami Shibata and Hiroyuki Eto.

Concept and creation
The main cast of Dragon Quest IV comprises different characters from different walks of life, all of whom eventually coalesce around the protagonist and their quest to save the world.  Each of the five chapters has its own set of characters and quest. The character designs were created by artist Akira Toriyama. Following the success of Dragon Quest III, the creator of Dragon Quest IV, Yuji Horii, wanted to make a distinct game from III rather than retread it too directly since he expected many people would begin the series with IV. In III, players obtain a full party at the beginning of the game. Horii varied the formula by splitting the game into chapters and having the chapters be separate quests, wanting players to experience each character's story before searching for their party members. He also intended on surprising players, introducing the characters Maya and Meena to the Hero when they are searching for the other characters first instead of Ragnar McRyan, who was the first character you played as.

In the NES version of the game, the lead character was controlled directly by the player, while other characters were controlled by artificial intelligence. It was initially considered giving each character AI that matches their in-game personality, but it was felt that it would not be satisfying. They also considered allowing monsters to join the party, but decided against it, viewing the AI system as adequate. Later versions of Dragon Quest IV allowed most characters to be controlled directly. In the English localization of the Nintendo DS version of Dragon Quest IV, various characters were given different accents. The first chapter gives characters Scottish accents, the second gives them Russian accents, and the fourth gives them French accents. This is unlike the Japanese versions of the different versions, where everyone has a standard Japanese accent. The English localization team for the DS version aimed to give the characters names that evoked the original English names for some characters while including the original names; this resulted in names such as Ragnar McRyan, which combined the English localization ""Ragnar"" and Japanese name ""Ryan.""

Reception
Dragon Quest IV has been noted as a pioneering game in character-based role-playing games. Eurogamer writer Simon Parkin enjoyed the conceit of the game having different starring characters in each chapter, particularly due to how much it diversifies the cast. Hardcore Gamer writer Chris Shive similarly enjoyed this structure, believing it successfully made players care about the whole cast.

The AI controlling the non-main characters of each chapter in the Nintendo Entertainment System version of the game has received negative reception, with Chris Shive commenting that the best improvement in the Nintendo DS version was allowing the player to control them directly. This AI design has led to issues with the AI, particularly the character Kiryl using the instant-death spell Whack on enemies immune to it, which gave him a reputation of being a stupid character. Automaton writer Takumi Nango praised the use of non-English accents in the English version of the Nintendo DS version, feeling that it was tastefully done. They praised the detail that the localization team put in, particularly how they made dogs' bark match their region as well, suggesting that they did a lot of research into the different dialects. They believed that the motivation to include different dialects was out of a desire to reflect how the main cast all hail from diverse regions, social classes, and occupations.",2025-04-01,"['Dragon Quest IV characters' 'Lists of Square Enix characters'

291,56381,76600721,8426,Willem Leyel's siege of Dansborg,"The siege of Dansborg (Danish; belejringen af Dansborg) alternatively the siege of Fort Dansborg (Danish; belejringen af Fort Dansborg) sometimes also referred to as Willem Leyel's siege of Dansborg (Danish; William Leyels belejring af Dansborg), was a siege initiated by traveler and seafarer, Willem (Danish; William) Leyel, against the men loyal to governor Bernt Pessart. The siege was concluded after the men at Dansborg opened the gates for Willem Leyel, surrendered, and accepted Leyel as the new governor.

 Background 

In 1620, on a voyage from Denmark to India, Ove Gjedde established Danish India at Tranquebar. His successor, Dutchman Ronald Crappé went further and established a far-flung string of Danish factories in Asia. These foundations were, though, not maintained by his successor, Bernt Pessart (. 1636-1643) who encumbered large debts from the start of his administration. Because of the economic failures, the largest investor in the company, king Christian IV of Denmark, sought to reestablish the economic success and therefore sent out experienced seafarer, Willem Leyel, to Tranquebar. 

 Arrival of Leyel 
Leyel went ashore at Tranquebar on 22 June 1644, with 70 armed men, both ""blacks and ""whites"", and two smaller guns. Concurrently, governor Bernt Pessart had left for Japan and left the fort in control of Jakob von Stackenborg. Stackenborg sealed off Dansborg for Leyel, and subsequently, Leyel now initiated a siege on the fortress.

 Siege 
Leyel was well-received by the local inhabitants of Tranquebar, who had suffered under Pessart’s rule, and now came with food and water to assist the besiegers. The local adrigar at once offered to assist Leyel with his own men. Leyel's army camped behind a stone powder magazine about two musket shots from Dansborg. The siege lasted for some time. The Thanjavurians, who were eager to get rid of Pessart and his governorship, now helped Leyel and his men by feeding them.

 Negotiations 

After some time, the commander of the guard, Frantz Erkmand, with some other men from Dansborg, came out and admitted that there was a shortage of nearly everything in Dansborg. Leyel now showed Erkmand the king's orders, upon which Erkmand promised, on behalf of the garrison, that they would surrender and recognize Leyel as their governor if Leyel promised to pardon them on behalf of the king. Leyel could not afford to lose more men on Tranquebar, and thus willingly accepted the demands.

 Aftermath 
The gates of Dansborg were now opened for Leyel and his men. Yet to his demise, there was not much left but the naked walls. Leyel initiated a closer inspection of Dansborg’s buildings and fortifications. There did not seem to be a whole door or window frame in all of the fortifications, and everything was in bad shape. Leyel would, despite setbacks, still try to reestablish the trade and prestige of the Danish East India Company, which had been lost to his predecessor.",2025-01-24,"['1640s in Danish India' 'Sieges involving Denmark–Norway'

292,35673,76008943,5019,Caroline Phillipson,"Caroline Giffard Phillipson (1823 – 1893) was a British poet and novelist.

 Early life 
Caroline Giffard Lethbridge was born on 1823 in Montgomeryshire, Wales. She was the eldest of eighteen children of Sir John Hesketh Lethbridge, 3rd Baronet. Her mother was Lethbridge's first wife, Harriet Mytton. In 1849, Caroline Lethbridge married John Tharp Burton Phillipson, with the wedding taking place in Paris, France.

 Career 
Caroline Phillipson wrote four books of poetry. The first, Lonely Hours (1856), was labelled ""sentimental doggerel"" in a negative review by novelist George Eliot in the Westminster Review. An enraged Phillipson published a pamphlet called A Song in Prose to the Westminster Owl. Though the anonymous review was by Eliot, Phillipson assumed it had been written by her partner George Henry Lewes and the pamphlet was a lengthy denunciation of Lewes. 

A later volume, Songs on Italy (1862), was full of fulsome praise of Italian patriot Giuseppe Garibaldi. A 20th century critic wrote that Phillipson ""maltreated the Muses most frightfully."" Correspondence between Garibaldi and Phillipson is owned by the Museo Civico di Sanremo.

Phillipson wrote one work of fiction, Ethel Beranger (1858), which The Athenaeum called ""a very silly novel.""

 Death 
Phillipson died in 1893 in Italy.

293,33270,75934419,41747,Salish Sea orcas,"The waters of the Salish Sea, on the west coast of North America, are home to several ecologically distinct populations of orcas (Orcinus orca). The area supports three major ecotypes of orcas: northern residents, southern residents, and transients. A fourth ecotype, the offshore orcas, occasionally venture into nearshore waters. Little to no interaction occurs between the different ecotypes. Resident and transient orcas have not been observed interbreeding, although occasional brief interactions occur.

Studied since the 1960s, the orcas of the Salish Sea region have become well-known in cetacean research. According to John KB Ford, Graeme B Ellis, and Kenneth C Balcomb, the resident orcas represent ""the most intensively studied population of marine mammals in the world."" The frequency of sightings of orcas in the Puget Sound region, combined with their prominent place in the ecosystem and their charisma, have made them icons of the region, and their likeness features prominently in Native American culture in the Northwest. Additionally, they are one of the main interests of the many whale watching industries that have sprung up in the region.

Overview
Southern resident orcas

The primary range of the Southern resident orcas stretches approximately from the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the south coast of Vancouver Island to the Tacoma Narrows and occasionally Hood Canal, with seasonal ranges encompassing the Pacific coast from British Columbia to Monterey Bay. As of October 2023, the estimated population size is 75 individuals. The population is primarily separated into three pods: J, K, and L. However, all individuals in the Southern resident population are descended from a single bloodline and are considered part of a single clan. The primary distinguishing factor between the Southern and Northern resident orcas is not linked to appearance, but rather matriarchal status, with males descended from living mothers doing more hunting than males without living mothers among southern residents. 

In a 1973 study of Northern resident orcas in the Georgia Strait, British-Canadian scientist Michael Bigg found that minor injuries, such as dents in the dorsal fins, did not fully heal over time and remained prominent on the individual for the rest of their lives. This led to the use of these marks as the primary method for individual identification in the wild. In addition to individual markings, distribution during the summer breeding season can be used to distinguish the northern or southern resident groups. This, along with charting the distribution of each group during summer and winter, is the most prominent way of recognizing both individual orcas and the group to which they belong. Both residents and transients are catalogued in this way, and both the Canadian Department of Fisheries and the Center for Whale Research use these methods to track all individual orcas within the Salish Sea. As of 2023, all 73 known southern residents, 310 northern residents, and 349 Bigg's orcas in British Columbia and Washington have been catalogued. In BC, cataloging orcas is primarily done by the provincial government, while in Washington, it is primarily done by the NGO nonprofit Center for Whale Research.

Both resident groups of orcas are known for having a more rounded and straight, somewhat slanted towards the back, upward-facing dorsal fin compared to transients, which have a more pointed, shark-like fin going straight up, and a more prominent, grayish ""cape"" on their backs. The eyespot of residents is usually smaller than transients, and is more in line with the body, having an upward slant near its rear edge. Differences in body size cannot be determined visually; however, residents overall are smaller than transients, with southern residents being the smallest of the three ecotypes.

Southern resident orcas feed exclusively on fish, with salmon being their preferred prey; it is estimated that up to 80% of the diet of southern residents consists of chinook salmon, mostly coming from the Fraser River. Other types of salmon, herring, halibut, and lingcod are also consumed. While there is no record of southern resident orcas eating harbor porpoises, at least 78 incidents have been recorded since 1962 involving orcas harassing harbor porpoises, of which 28 resulted in the porpoise's death; it has never been confirmed whether this is the result of competition for food, rough play, or true aggression.

Low reproductive rates hinder population growth among orcas. Females do not mature until they are 10 to 13 years old, and gestation is approximately 15 months. With the female maintaining care for her calf until it is two years old, orcas are only able to produce a calf once every 39 months, and thus cannot recover quickly from population decline. Inbreeding also has a negative effect on the population. The total mortality level in young of the year orcas can be as high as 43%.

Northern resident orcas

The larger population of northern residents primarily ranges from the mid-coast of Alaska south into British Columbia through the Strait of Georgia and both sides of Vancouver Island south to Gray's Harbor, with the bulk of their range encompassing the Strait of Georgia and most of Vancouver Island, and north to Haida Gwaii. The northern residents number over 300 whales. They demonstrate seasonal shifts, generally inhabiting Chatham Sound in summer, Johnstone Strait in fall, and the San Juan Islands in winter. Northern resident orcas are divided into three clans totaling 16 pods,  showing higher genetic diversity compared with southern residents. As with southern residents, northern residents subsist mostly on salmon, with chinook constituting the bulk of their diet. However, the unique hunting techniques of northern residents may have assisted in their recovery compared to southern residents. In northern residents, females do most of the herding and hunting of salmon, whereas in southern residents, males do most of the hunting. It has been found that female southern residents do not actively forage when nursing calves, so males must hunt in their place; in northern residents, females continue to hunt even when nursing calves. Lack of foraging by female southern residents during calving season may reduce the ability of the group to hunt cooperatively and deprive it of valuable foraging experience.

Northern residents do not differ morphologically from southern residents aside from individual markings. Their calls closely resemble one another, as do overall body shapes, and life history is assumed to be similar for both types. Differentiation between groups focuses primarily on their distribution; only southern residents are known to enter Puget Sound and the Whidbey Island area, and are the primary species found within the San Juan Islands and the southern part of Vancouver Island; whereas northern residents do not usually leave the Strait of Georgia or Johnstone Strait. However, given that both types can inhabit the San Juan Islands and southern residents occasionally enter BC waters, individual and pod identification are the only clear means of differentiating the northern and southern residents pods. No known direct interactions between northern and southern resident pods have been documented.

Transient orcas

Little is known about the genetics and life history of transient orcas, also known as Bigg's orcas. Unlike residents, much less individual identification via photo-ID has been conducted, largely due to increased spatial movement and less knowledge of overall pod structure compared to residents. Nevertheless, transients have been identified in increasing numbers over the years, and like residents, can be identified individually by marks and scars on their bodies. Known for their more shark-like fins, large size, solid gray patches, and larger eyespots, transient orcas are found throughout the Salish Sea region, which appears to be their main area of occurrence. Their primary calls, which differ from residents, are composed of a series of click-like vocalizations and harsh, screaming sounds primarily used to frighten and trap prey when hunting. The primary diet of transient orcas includes harbor seals, Steller sea lions, harbor porpoises, Dall's porpoises, Pacific white-sided dolphins, and Minke whales. Among these, the harbor seal is the most common prey; one survey estimated that more than half of the diet of transients in the Salish Sea region consists of harbor seals. Attacks on large whales in the region are relatively rare and no incidents of successful predation have occurred, although isolated incidents of transients harassing gray whales and humpback whales, including predation, have been observed outside the Salish Sea. However, interactions do sometimes become spectacular; in October 2022, a rare battle near Vancouver was observed between a pod of transients and humpbacks that ended with the group disappearing into the fog, with the ultimate outcome unknown.

Having split from other orcas 750,000 years ago, no interbreeding occurs between transient and resident orcas. Interactions between transients and residents are very rare; they actively avoid one another and are never known to socialize. Nevertheless, when interactions do occur, it seems the residents, despite being smaller and less carnivorous, dominate the transients. In 2021, southern residents K16 and L72 surfaced in the midst of a pod of transient pod's hunt of an unknown prey species. After a short scuffle, the transients quickly departed the area, leaving the area to the residents. A similar but more brutal encounter was recorded in 1993, when transients were attacked by members of the J-pod and almost forced onto the rocks at Nanaimo. After a battle that lasted for at least several minutes, the transients fled the area with scars, leaving the victorious residents to regroup.

Offshore orcas
Offshore orcas, first described in 1979, are primarily found more than 10 miles (16 km) from shore. Just over 280 offshore orcas are known from the Eastern North Pacific, primarily occurring off the coast of British Columbia. Although forays into the Salish Sea are rare, the area immediately offshore, including the Barkley submarine canyon, is home to large numbers. In contrast to transient and resident orcas, the teeth of offshore orcas are usually quite worn-down and often blunt, poentially shortening their lives; this has been confirmed to be linked to their primary diet - sharks - and the tough skin they possess. The sharks most commonly taken are mako, thresher, sevengill, and on rare occasions, great white sharks. The first recorded incidence of orca predation on great white sharks, in 1997, may have involved an offshore whale.

Human history
The earliest recorded post-colonization interactions between Salish Sea orcas and humans occurred in the early 1960s, when fishermen in Seymour Narrows, near Campbell River, BC, began to complain of orcas taking salmon from nets and interfering with fishing operations. At the time, orcas were not only viewed as costly competition with fishermen for salmon, but as dangerous and threatening to humans as well, and were viewed negatively across the region. In response to these complaints, a machine gun was installed at Seymour Narrows with the intent of killing any orca that passed by. Although the gun was removed after a few months without ever being fired, its installation reflected a persistent degree of negativity surrounding orcas in the region. Despite their reputation as man-eaters, fascination with orcas led to many wanting to see these largely unknown creatures close-up, alive or dead, in order to better understand them. In 1964, Vancouver Aquarium curator Murray Newman requested an orca be harpooned in order to serve as a reference for a life-sized sculpture that would greet museum visitors. A team led by Sam Burich and Ronald Sparrow was sent out to capture an orca. On July 16, 1964, a pod was sighted and one of the whales was harpooned, but did not die. Not wishing to seem inhumane, Newman instructed the team not to kill the whale, but instead tow it to a netted-off area at Burrard Dry Dock near the Vancouver Aquarium. While the initial motive in keeping the whale was to provide a template for the sculpture and present scientists with a unique opportunity to study a little-known creature, the aquarium soon became overwhelmed with visitors eager to see an orca for the first time. Within weeks, the whale had become a national interest, and was given the name Moby Doll. By now, the whale was marketed as a public attraction and began to spark interest in other aquariums for catching orcas. Moby Doll ultimately did not live long after capture, and died October 9, 1964 from an illness caused by the low water salinity at Burrard Dry Dock and complications from his harpoon wounds.

Undeterred by the short life of Moby Doll, others soon set out to capture orcas from the Puget Sound region. The first, and most famous, was accidental. In June 1965, a large bull orca became trapped in a salmon net near Namu, British Columbia, and was sold to animal collector Ted Griffin for $8000. Naming the whale Namu, after its place of capture, Griffin placed the individual in the care of the Seattle Marine Aquarium, which he owned at the time. For over a year Namu entertained millions, even starring in a film named after him. This publicity set off a string of orca captures, with dozens of aquariums attempting to replicate the success of Namu. It was during this time that a female orca named Shamu was captured from Puget Sound. She was intended as a potential mate for Namu, but the two did not get along and Shamu was sent to SeaWorld San Diego in late 1965, beginning a tradition of keeping orcas at SeaWorld that continues to this day. Namu died in July 1966; it was initially believed that he had drowned after trying to escape his pen, but a subsequent autopsy revealed that he died of a bacterial infection caused by sewage runoff into Elliott Bay.

Following this, orca captures became widespread worldwide; an estimated 263 orcas were captured in the Salish Sea region alone between 1962 and 1977. Of these, 50 were taken to oceanariums, 12 died during capture, and 201 were released. The impact of this take on local populations was significant given that 47 of the 62 captured or killed orcas were southern residents, corresponding to more than half of the southern resident population. Many believe the failure of the southern residents to increase over the past few decades has been linked to the loss of genetic diversity resulting from the 1960s captures. The fact that all three pods (J, K, L) interbreed and interact regularly creates additional genetic challenges for the survivors, and no pod maintains its historical diversity. In 1970, the notorious Penn Cove capture resulted in the deaths of five calves and the capture of seven more, including the female Lolita (Tokitae) who died in 2023 after 53 years in captivity. The brutality of the event led to institution of a permit system by the state of Washington in 1971 in order to control the herding of orcas. This was soon superseded by the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, which forbade the killing or harassment of any marine mammal and brought the capture of orcas to an end.

However, an economic hardship exemption clause remained that allowed SeaWorld to continue orca capture operations. Until 1976 in Washington and 1977 in BC, SeaWorld carried out small-scale captures of whales in Salish Sea waters. These came to an end when a particularly cruel attempt at capture was observed by Ralph Monroe, an aid to Governor Dan Evans, who stopped the capture upon seeing the orcas in distress. After further investigation, Monroe phoned Governor Evans, who filed a federal restraining order against SeaWorld, forbidding them from taking any additional whales. After a legal battle, all orca captures in Washington came to an end. While orca captures in BC came to an end a year later in 1977,  captures in other areas such as Iceland continued well into the 1980s.
 
Orca behavior and social life in the Salish Sea came to the public eye in the early 1970s with the works of Mike Bigg. In addition to identifying individual whales via their scars and body patterns, Bigg was able to successfully differentiate them by their habits and individual associations. Bigg was the first to identify transient orcas as significantly different in eating habits, behavior, and distribution from resident orcas; hence they bear his name. His recommendation in the late 1970s that orcas be placed on the endangered list in Canada  fueled interest in protecting the animals throughout the region. The first sanctuary specifically designed to protect cetaceans was established in 1982 in Robson Bight, part of Johnstone Strait, was dedicated in honor of Bigg. Prior to his death in 1990, Bigg had lobbied for the inclusion of orcas on the Canadian threatened list, and while he never lived to see them listed, four of the five known populations in Canada, including the northern residents, were listed as ""At Risk"" in 2001. In 2008, Johnstone Strait and southeastern Queen Charlotte Strait were designated as critical habitat for northern resident orcas. Likewise, NOAA designated all of Puget Sound and the Juan de Fuca Strait as southern resident orca critical habitat in 2006, and updated it in 2021 to include all coastal waters of the Northwest from Cape Flattery to Monterey Bay.

Ongoing threats to orcas include ship traffic, pollution, dams, and arguably most important, conflict with humans for food. Since the 1980s, salmon populations in Puget Sound have declined by 60%, and hatcheries have made only marginal success in helping them recover. The primary food source of southern residents is Fraser River salmon, which provide over 70% of all salmon in the system. While Fraser River salmon as a whole are not currently endangered, chinook - which provide more than three-quarters of the diet of southern residents - have declined by more than half in the last decades, largely due to hatchery mismanagement, mishandled recovery plans, and an industry-based approach to solving environmental problems. The Skagit, Snohomish, and Puyallup chinook runs are also gravely depleted, and as of the last major 5-year salmon recovery plan (2016), all chinook salmon populations in the Puget Sound drainage system are listed as below recovery escape levels (i.e., the level at which the population can be considered on the road to recovery). The Fraser salmon fare little better; 14 of 16 stocks of chinook that spawn in the Fraser are listed as threatened or endangered by Canada's Species At Risk Act. Only two potential populations of chinook with a distribution including Puget Sound are at a viable size.

Since the 1980s, Salish Sea orcas have become icons of the wild nature of the region, an emblem of the charismatic megafauna of Puget Sound, and a reminder that the region's nature is precious and worth saving. In the forty years since the Johnstone Strait was first declared protected in 1982, almost the entire Johnstone Strait-Georgia Strait region, as well as Puget Sound and most of the strait of Juan de Fuca, has been declared critical orca habitat. While symbolically a major victory, human impacts on the whales have continued, as the designation has no legal basis to regulate human activity in the whales' range. Equally concerning is the  list of toxic chemicals the orcas have accumulated in their bloodstream over years of living in industrially-polluted waters. Most notorious of these are PCBs, which may be responsible for deformities resulting in miscarriages and stillbirths, exemplified by Tahlequah's calf in 2018. Additionally, it has recently been revealed that southern residents contain large amounts of 4NP, a toxic chemical used in pulp and paper production, that when ingested, remain in the whales' systems for life, and can even pass from mothers to calves during gestation. 

In 2008, the first recovery plan for southern resident orcas was released by NOAA, consisting of an overview of the life history of the population as well as their prospects for recovery. The main factors identified as inhibiting recovery were sonar activities caused by naval exercises, collisions with ships transiting through orca habitat, growth and developmental problems caused by chemical ingestion, and most importantly, loss of salmon caused by stream degradation. The updated recovery plan in 2016-2020 identified the primary threats to orca populations as 1) negative interactions with vessels, and 2) depletion of salmon food sources. The need for protection of orca health, habitat, and conservation through outreach were emphasized. While this plan has the potential to make a positive impact, no significant progress has been made on restoring the salmon runs of Puget Sound or the Fraser River as of 2024. Speed limits and shipping lanes to ensure boating and shipping traffic does not collide with orcas are still lacking. While the southern resident population, currently at 74 individuals, appears to have stabilized with the birth of a new calf and the death of male K34 in 2023, little progress on recovery can be expected until the NOAA recovery plan is fully implemented, including restoration of salmon runs.

Individual whales
Luna

Luna, identified as L98, was a male orca from the southern resident L pod. Known for his inquisitive and friendly nature, he took up residence in Nootka Sound, on the west coast of Vancouver Island. In 2021, he was separated from his pod (a year in which five pod members died) and lived on his own in the Sound for almost five years. His increasing friendliness to humans and desire to interact with boats caused concern. An attempt by the Canadian DFO to return him to his pod was dropped after opposition from locals. In March 2006, after getting too close to a tugboat whose crew he knew and frequently interacted with, he was sucked into the propeller vortex and killed.

Springer

Springer, identified at A73, is a female northern resident from the A pod found as a calf in Seattle's Elliott Bay in January 2002. It is considered highly unusual for northern resident orcas to enter Puget Sound, primarily the domain of the southern residents. After the calf remained in the area for several months, displaying highly uncharacteristic behaviors including rubbing against boats and following any traffic that entered her area, along with declining physical health, the decision was made to transport her to a sea pen, where she was raised for a month. Originally, her captivity was intended to last 1–2 years, as it was believed she would have to be brought up to BC to reunite with her pod. However, her family was detected in Johnstone Strait in July. Given that she appeared to be in good health, she was taken to Campbell River and released into her pod, which welcomed her. She has since given birth to two healthy calves.

Lolita (Tokitae)

Lolita was a southern resident of the L pod, captured in Penn Cove in 1970, who spent the majority of her life at Miami Seaquarium in Florida. At the time of her death in 2023, she was the last remaining captive orca from the 1960s-1970s Washington captures, prior to the implementation of the Marine Mammal Protection Act. After five decades of captivity, she was succumbing to skin lesions, with a chronic lung infection continuing to weaken her body. Since the death of Hugo, a male orca captured with her in 1980, Lolita had been the only orca at Miami Seaquarium. She shared her tank with common dolphins, pilot whales, and Pacific white-sided dolphins throughout her time at Seaquarium. The refusal to release Lolita, as well as her overall living standards before her passing, have become a symbol for the movement opposing orca captivity for reasons other than medical need.

Granny

Granny (southern resident J2) was the oldest fully authenticated wild orca on record, at least 65 years old at the time of her presumed death in October 2016. Her exact age will never be known; she was first sighted in 1967, during an orca capture, and was considered too old for capture due to her age (estimated at more than 40, due to her being judged to be post-reproductive). A later sighting of her in 1971 seemed to confirm that she had borne calves, with the male accompanying her (J1 Ruffles) appearing to be her son, although this was later deemed to be false. Her age was initially estimated at 105 at the time of her death, thought to have been born in 1911. However, with the revelation that J1 was not her calf, and a biopsy sample taken in 2016 just before her death, her actual age was estimated at 65–80 years old.

In popular culture

The plight of the orcas has attracted attention throughout the Pacific Northwest and the United states since the 1980s. The Salish Sea orcas have become an iconic natural treasure of the region and a symbol of the area's ecological productivity. Many whale watching organizations throughout the region target the orcas, including resident and transient groups, and often work with nonprofit organizations like the Center for Whale Research and The Whale Museum to promote orca conservation. Native American tribes and First Nations throughout the area hold the whales in high regard. The Lummi Nation in particular has been outspoken about its relationship with the animals. Within the tribe, orcas are regarded as relatives, with some considering them the reincarnated spirits of chiefs. In particular, they were instrumental in the ultimately unsuccessful attempt to return Lolita from Miami Seaquarium back to Puget Sound. The Tulalip tribe of Everett also hold orcas in high regard, often displaying them on totem poles and artwork designs.  An orca is the official mascot of the Tulalip Casino and Resort.",2024-11-18,['Orcas'],"['Salish Sea' 'North America' 'orca' 'ecotypes' 'northern residents'

299,25503,75702260,18869,Marica Stanković,"Marica (Marija) Stanković (born Vragović; 31 December 1900 – 8 October 1957), known as ""Sister Marica"" (), was a Croatian school teacher, writer, Catholic layperson and founder of the Associates of Christ the King (Suradnice Krista Kralja). Along with Ivan Merz, she was among the most prominent members and initiators of Catholic movements in Croatia in the first half of the 20th century. Since October 2006, she is considered as a Servant of God. Archived by Croatian Web Archive (HAW).

 Life 
Early years and education
Stanković was born on 31 December 1900 in Zagreb, in a Vragović family. She was baptised in a St. Mark's Church on 1 January 1901. She attended Sisters of Mercy's preparatory school, where she was also a member of the Congregation of Mary. Stanković started publishing her first literary works and articles in various Catholic magazines at the age of 18. She studied Croatian language and history at the Higher Pedagogical Academy (today Faculty of Teacher Education) in Zagreb.

In 1920, she became acquainted with the ideas of the Catholic lay movement, especially of the Croatian Catholic Movement led by bishop Antun Mahnić and his motto ""Croatia reborn in Christ"". At the gathering of the European Orao Youth in Maribor, where she represented her school, she met Ivan Merz and that encounter changed her spiritual life: 

Teaching, social and Catholic activities
In 1921, she was employed as a teacher in Sračinec near Varaždin. In 1923 she moved to Donja Voća. In 1924, she changes her family name from Vragović to Stanković. In 1925, she enrolled at the Higher Pedagogical School in Zagreb. At the general gathering in Šibenik, the Association of Croatian Female Eagles was founded, and Marica joined the first committee as an educational officer. In 1926, she became the editor-in-chief of the monthly magazine Za vjeru i dom (hr) of the Congregation of Teachers in Zagreb, a position she held until 1945. At the pilgrimage of the Association of Croatian Female Eagles' members in Rome in 1926, she visited lay institute Opera Cardinal Ferrari where she got to know the principles and activities of the Catholic Action. After two years of studying at the Higher Pedagogical School, in 1927 she went to Slatina as a teacher at a civil school. At the Association of Croatian Female Eagles' assembly in Sarajevo, she was elected president.

In 1929, she continues her studies at the Higher Pedagogical School and goes to Prague on the general gathering of Eagles. That year, by the degree of the Alexander I, all gymnastics societies were abolished, except for the pro-regime Yugoslav Falcon (Sokol), and so were Croatian male (HOS) and female Eagles (SHO). In 1930, she was elected as a leader of Grand Crusader Sisterhood, female branch of the Crusaders organisation founded on the principles of Eagleship in 1930. In 1931, she graduated and started working as a teacher in Čakovec. In 1933, she was moved to Gračac and then in Kutina, and in 1935 in Zagreb.

In 1938, she participates with six female colleagues in the Crusaders' workshop and eight-day spiritual exercies in Banja Luka on the occasion the 10th anniversary of Merz's death. At the encouragement of fr. Tomislav Poglajen, who came from Belgium where he collaborated with organisation of Catholic workers (JOC), she dedicated exercies to discernment on her ideas about lay organisation. During the exercises, she wrote a draft of the Rules and the name of the future institute was proposed. Returning to Zagreb, she presented her ideas to cardinal Alojzije Stepinac. She attributed the foundation of the institute to the influence of Ivan Merz in her life.

In 1942, she was awarded Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice for her work in promoting the Catholic Action.

In 1944, she published book Mladost vedrine (""The youth of serenity"").

Persecution, arrest and trial
Following the establishment of SFRY after the Second World War, Catholic Church in Croatia faced persecutions. Crusaders' organisation was dissolved in 1945. On 2 June 1945, new communist authorities convened a gathering of educators in the hall of the Chamber of Workers in Zagreb, led by Marko Belinić and with around 2500 participants. Along with teacher Marija Grgić, Stanković was the only one who stood up to defend archbishop Stepinac: 

During 1947, nine female members of the former Catholic Action and its priest Ante Radić were arrested. Stanković was arrested on 1 September 1947. Before her arrest, she spent eight days on spiritual exercises in a Carmelite monastery in Brezovica. After a six-month pretrial detention, a show trial at the District Court in Zagreb took place on 24 and 25 January 1948. To the accusations of collaboration with the ""enemy of the people"", she replied: 

After her address was interrupted, she concluded her defense with the following words:  

She was sentenced to five years in the women's prison camp in Požega. After the verdict was read, she sang the chorale with eight other defendants: Christus vincit, Christus regnat, Christus imperat!

Imprisonment
On 1 April 1948, she was taken from the prison in Zagreb to the Penitentiary home for women in Požega to serve her sentence. She was forced to work on drainage of the Lonjsko polje. She wrote memories on her prison days in a book Godine teške i bolne (""Difficult and painful years""), published posthumously. While she was in prison, her associates worked on canonical recognition of the Association.

In a letter from prison in 1951 to her Associates of Christ the King in Zagreb she wrote: ""It is much easier to live, you can cope with much more and you look at life in a completely different way, if there is joy within us... Joy is not outside of us. Joy is in us, if God is in us. Such joy cannot be lost. No one can stifle her growth...""

Canonical recognition, illness and death
While she was still in prison, on May 18, 1951, the Congregation of monks distributed their ""let it be founded"" to her at the hands of the ordinary sede impedíto Salis-Seewis. After serving her sentence, she left the camp on 1 September 1952. On the same day, in the parish church in Požega, she made confession and received Eucharist first time after five years. The next day, she arrives in Zagreb and settles in the house of her associates in Hrastovac. She devoted herself to harmonizing the organization's Rules with the guidelines of the Holy See's documents on the lay institutes Provida Mater Ecclesia and Primo Feliciter. Cardinal Stepinac supported her efforts in letters he wrote from house arrest in Krašić.

On 18 October 1953, lay institute Associates of Christ the King was canonically established; the Rules were approved without changes, the Holy See recognized the episcopal significance of the institution, and the archbishop of Zagreb was appointed as ordinary. Following the establishment, she writes texts for the life and worj of the Associates. In February 1955, she also completed her prison records. At the end of the year, her health rapidly deteriorates and she has to go to the hospital. In 1956, she wrote a commentary on the Rules.

At the beginning of 1957, her health deteriorated again. On 8 October, she died surrounded by her colleagues in her room in Hrastovac. She was buried on 11 October at Mirogoj. At the funeral, her wish from her will was fulfilled: ""If the church authorities allow, let one girl wear my papal decoration on a pillow in front of my coffin. I would also like my funeral to be a silent manifestation to the Pope."" The funeral rites were led by archbishop Franjo Šeper.

In the speech at the funeral, Rev. Ivan Kozelj said: 

 Beatification 
Even before the start of the official procedure, cardinal Franjo Kuharić proclaimed her publicly as a Servant of God. The Croatian Bishops' Conference appointed Milan Pušec as postulator for her cause in 2005. After receiving the declaration of nihil obstat by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome on 10 June 2006, Archbishop of Zagreb Josip Bozanić published a declaration on the cause on 19 October 2006 and opened the process for her beatification on 16 November 2006. Since 2008, postulature publishes a magazine Poruka vedrine (hr) about Stanković's life and work and with news on her beatification procedure. Vinko Mamić, OCD (hr) was named as a new postulator on 31 October 2011.

311,36557,76027353,28804,Dry Zone theater,"The Dry Zone theater, also known as the Anyar theater, is one of the theaters of the Myanmar civil war (2021–present), taking place in Myanmar's Dry Zone (or Anyar) region which encompasses the Bamar-majority Sagaing, Magway and Mandalay regions. It has been described as the ""prime center"" of resistance against the junta.

 Background 
The Dry Zone has been the historic heartland of Myanmar and rarely saw armed violence in the modern conflict in Myanmar since 1948 as a predominantly Buddhist and Bamar farming region. This led to the Tatmadaw (the military of Myanmar) to not maintain a heavy presence there. 

The fighting in the Dry Zone theater starting in 2021 changed this trajectory. Without the presence of EAOs, the Bamar PDF groups are characterized as local cells acting autonomously towards simple and directed action against the military towards the 2021 coup. In the 2021-2022 dry season, the PDFs began to work more closely together and coordinate towards larger goals.

 Timeline 

 2021 
After the coup, the Dry Zone saw a ""precipitous uptick in violence"".

In late November 2021, junta forces ambushed and destroyed a base belonging to Monywa PDF's Squadron 205 near Palin village, Sagaing Region, forcing resistance fighters to flee. The base was the site of a workshop where the PDF had made explosive devices, which were destroyed during the raid. On 9 December 2021, the Myaing PDF in Magway Region ambushed two military vehicles with 3 handmade explosives, claiming to have injured at least 3 soldiers. Salingyi G-Z PDF fighters detonated explosives in another attack on a convoy in Salingyi, triggering an assault on the town by about 100 junta soldiers. The soldiers captured and burnt 10 fighters and one civilian.

In December 2021, the military sent around 150 Airborne Division soldiers in helicopters to the west of Depayin to carry out air assault missions. They surrounded Depayin Township where PDF fighters were positioned. On 13 December, Tatmadaw troops launched an offensive to retake Ke Bar, Ayadaw Township with the assistance of artillery and forced resistance fighters to retreat. On 17 December, the Tatmadaw and a military-backed Pyusawhti militia launched a surprise air assault on Hnan Khar, Gangaw Township in Magway Region killing 20 resistance fighters from the Yaw Defence Force. In late 2021, Myaung PDF resistance forces ""seized two boats, an oil vessel and a cargo ship"" on the Chindwin River on the grounds that ""those on board were unable to demonstrate that the vessels did not belong to the junta"".

 2022 
As targeted personnel attacks increased, around 50 Myanmar junta personnel and Pyusawhti militia members were reportedly killed during raids and ambushes by PDF across three townships in Sagaing Region on 9 February 2022. The PDF ambushed flotillas transporting supplies and soldiers, setting at least one flotilla on fire. On 7 February, junta soldiers were killed by local PDF surprise attacks using drones in the Sagaing Region. The PDF also suffered losses, with 12 fighters killed in a battle in Khin-U Township.

Many cities saw violent clashes during Union Day. PDF forces launched an attack in Naypyitaw, the capital city, during the military's celebrations, killing at least 4 junta soldiers. Mandalay also saw civilian guerrilla groups and PDFs in Maha Aung Myay and Pyigyidagun Townships shooting at junta forces and throwing homemade bombs. Tatmadaw troops killed eight guerrilla fighters while raiding two resistance hideouts in retaliation.

 2023 

In October 2023, anti-junta forces launched Operation Taungthaman in the Mandalay Region.

On 6 November 2023, Kawlin, Sagaing Region fell to the coalition during Operation 1027, marking the first district-level capital seized during the operation.

2024

Tatmadaw forces recaptured the district capital of Kawlin on 10 February after almost 10 days of fighting.Myanmar Junta Retakes Town From Civilian Government in Sagaing Region. The Irrawaddy. February 13, 2024  After this, junta forces razed the settlement, destroying the majority of homes in Kawlin and surrounding villages. On 22 February, junta forces launched an offensive to recapture the town of Maw Luu from the KIA and ABSDF. The joint rebel forces had taken the key town in December 2023, blocking the Shwebo-Myitkyina road, during Operation 1027. On 14 March, junta forces took the village of Kampani, Kalay Township in an campaign to resist anti-junta attacks on Kalay. Despite the campaign, on 16 March resistance forces captured the Pyusawhti-controlled village of Kyaung Taik north of Kalay.

While the junta launched its counteroffensives, allied resistance launched an offensive to capture Kani, capturing around 80% of the town by 7 March. After almost 10 days of fighting, by 15 March, rebels were forced to give up their efforts to capture the town after overwhelming junta resistance.

On 4 April 2024 the People's Defense Force launched an unprecedented drone attack against Aye Lar airbase, the main Tatmadaw headquarters, and Min Aung Hlaing's residence in the capital, Naypyidaw. Almost 30 drones were deployed; junta forces claimed 7 were shot down. Myawaddy TV said 13 fixed-wing drones were shot down and there were no casualties or damage to property. NUG claimed the attack was ""a success"". On 12 April, local People's Defense Forces claimed that they killed over a dozen junta soldiers in another attack on Aye Lar Airbase.

On 19 April junta forces launched a counteroffensive to retake Shwe Pyi Aye, Homalin Township, after it was captured in November 2023.

On 11 June the Union Liberation Front and Sagaing Region People's Defence Organisation captured a junta base near the Sagaing capital Monywa. On 27 June, a coalition of several PDFs launched an offensive on Budalin.

On 17 July, People's Defense Forces launched 2 rockets at Nay Pyi Taw International Airport, causing no casualties.

On 10 August, Myingyan District PDF launched an offensive against Taungtha and Natogyi. Natogyi was briefly captured before being recaptured by the junta soon after. On 15 August, PDF launched an offensive on Tabayin, capturing the town by 18 August. Shortly after, due to a junta counteroffensive, PDF withdrew from the town. In mid-August, the KIA and PDF launched joint offensives on Indaw, Pinlebu, and Htigyaing. Resistance entirely capturing Pinlebu on 8 October, defeating almost 800 junta soldiers.

On 27 October, the anniversary of Operation 1027, Maung Saungkha announced that the Bamar People's Liberation Army would begin operations in the Anyar region of Myanmar.

On 11 November, the Burma National Revolution Army and several other PDF's launched attacks on Pale. After capturing several areas of the town, they were forced to retreat due to a junta counteroffensive.

Firefight broke out on the Ann-Padan Road in Ngape Township the 21st of November as a resistance group, the People's Revolution Alliance (Magway) ambushed 40 regime forces east of Gokkyi Village, the resistance group said. The group also claimed to have killed nine regime forces in the ambush while wounding 10 others. One of the local resistance groups, the Chin Defense Force - Asho (CDF-Asho), said it ambushed 20 regime forces performing security duty on a section of Ann-Padan Road in Ngape Township, Magway Region at around 6 a.m. on Monday 25 November. During the ambush, four regime soldiers were killed and many others injured, while a military weapon and some equipment were seized.

2025

Starting from January 11 the ethnic Arakan Army (AA) and allies have launched an assault on Myanmar junta outposts guarding an artillery base on the Ann-Padan Road linking Rakhine State with neighboring Magway Region, according to local sources. Fighting broke out on Saturday 11 January at outposts in two Arakan Mountain villages close to Goggyi, located just 32 kilometers from Padan in Magwe’s Ngape Township. The People’s Revolution Alliance-Magway group reported attacking five junta vehicles carrying around 100 junta soldiers near Goggyi village with remote-controlled mines, killing four and wounding 13 others.

On 15 March 2025 Myanmar Junta launched a military operation to recapture some rural areas in Katha Township. State Administration Council troops from LID 309 departure from Katha Town assaulting resistance positions in rural areas of the township, suffering a devastating defeat against fighters from Katha PDF.

 Humanitarian impact 
According to the research group Data for Myanmar, more than 57,183 civilian homes in Anyar have been burned down by junta forces, making up 94% of the total number of civilian homes burned down across the country.

Since 2021, as a result of the state-sponsored violence following the 2021 Myanmar coup d'état, increasing temperatures, the COVID-19 pandemic, and increasingly-poor harvests, a widespread exodus of Dry Zone residents to other areas of Myanmar has occurred.

 History 
The General Federation of Women's Clubs of Arizona was established in 1901 and the Woman's Club of Mesa was founded in 1917 by 53 women. The group focused on social events, educational speakers, funding city parks, giving scholarships to students, and feeding hungry school children.

In 1923 after cotton prices crashed, the club and the city paid off the balance due on the property for Mesa's first hospital, preventing it from closure. Going forward, the club set aside time for ""hospital sew days"" where members would bring their sewing machines to the clubhouse and sew and create medical supplies.

A number of improvements were made to the clubhouse over the years. In 1931, the junior members raised money for hardwood flooring. In 1937, a swamp cooler was added which was replaced with central air conditioning in 1989. The year before, in 1988, a wheelchair ramp was installed.

In 1990 when the club became inactive, they donated their building to the General Federation of Women's Clubs of Arizona to serve as a headquarters. The building was subsequently sold to the Guild of the Vale, a for profit business running the facility as an event venue.

 Architecture 
The 1931, Phoenix architect Henry C. Grote designed the clubhouse in a Spanish Colonial Revival style. Joseph Nesbitt, whose wife was a member of the club, was selected as the builder after submitting a very low quote of only $10,580. The one-story building  is rectangular except for the kitchen in the rear.

The exterior of the building is painted white brick with a simple cornice detail running along the top of all the facades. Above each window is a Roman arch with articulated impost blocks and plain tympanum panels.

The most prominent architectural feature is a stucco turret with inlaid tiles in a diamond pattern. Under the turret, the main entrance which is surrounded by a corbel arch with brick columns topped with a bracket-like medallions. Above the door is a sign shaped like a banner and a semi-circular fanlight window. The roof of the turret has mission tiles made of terra cotta. 

The interior is dominated by a large open hall with a stage but also includes a kitchen, restrooms, storage room, and a backstage area. The walls are lathe and plaster with coved ceilings. Arabesque plaster detailing flank the fireplace, stage, and entry room.",2025-03-07,"['National Register of Historic Places in Maricopa County, Arizona'

After being the starting scrum-half for the first part of the season, Senio found himself battling it out for regular game time with rookie Andy Ellis. However, Ellis was injured in the semi-final against the Bulls and Senio started the 2006 Super 14 Final against the Hurricanes. The day after the final, Senio was selected for the Junior All Blacks to play in the inaugural Pacific Five Nations tournament.

He was a replacement in the final as Clermont won the Top 14 title in 2009–10.

316,16158,5297517,5036,Summer of the Monkeys,"Summer of the Monkeys is a 1976 children's story written by Wilson Rawls. It was published by Doubleday (later released by Yearling Books) and was the winner of the William Allen White Book Award and the California Young Reader Medal.Children's Literature Review.p197.

Plot summary
The book is set about the end of the nineteenth  century. The protagonist is a 14-year-old boy named Jay Berry Lee, who had enjoyed an idyllic, nature-based if impoverished childhood.  Born to Missouri sharecroppers, he moves with his family to Oklahoma after his grandfather offers them free land.  Daisy, his sister, has a crippled leg, and they devote much effort to gaining enough money to pay for reconstructive surgery.  One day, while looking for their lost milk cow, Jay Berry discovers monkeys in a nearby river bottom.  Visiting his grandfather's store, he learns that they have escaped from a traveling circus, which has offered a vast reward for their capture: $100 for the chief monkey, ""Jimbo"", and $2 each for the others.  Jay Berry makes multiple attempts to capture them using traps and a net borrowed from his grandfather, but he gains only scratches and bites from them, at one point even losing his britches in the process.

Jay Berry's grandfather contacts the circus and is advised to attempt to befriend Jimbo. Jay Berry decides to go look for them and he finds them around a hidden still; the drunken monkeys indeed befriend him, but their gesture of friendship is a gift of whiskey that leaves him drunk.  After returning to his shocked family, he goes with his grandfather to a nearby town to visit the library and discover alternate methods of monkey-catching.  Having bought supplies such as coconuts and necessary supplies for Daisy and the rest of the family, they return home, but the monkeys steal it all.

Daisy discovers a fairy ring that the family believes can make wishes come true. Jay Berry, despite an intense but unrealistic desire to own a horse and a .22 (because of the family's financial situation, and the cunning ability of the monkeys to evade capture, secretly wishes that his sister's leg would be made well.  Unbeknownst to Jay Berry (and the reader), Daisy wishes for her brother to get his coveted pony and gun.

Soon afterward, a fierce storm frightens the monkeys into accompanying him into captivity, and he quickly returns them to the circus for his reward.  Although he considers buying the pony and rifle, he chooses to finance Daisy's surgery to fix her crippled leg instead.  In the end, Daisy's surgery expenses were less than expected, and grandpa's negotiation skills, Jay Berry has enough money to get the .22 gun and pony he had long desired.

319,21827,75612459,7260,Cascade Saddle Track,"The Cascade Saddle Track, also known as the Cascade Saddle Route, is a  alpine tramping track in the Mount Aspiring National Park, New Zealand that takes approximately four days to complete. It is known for its ""spectacular"" views but is considered an expert-level track due to the hazardous conditions.

 Description 
The route is typically undertaken from east to west and links the Matukituki Valley with the Dart River valley. The start of the track is accessed from Wānaka and the end of the track links with the Rees and Dart Tracks, with the exit towards Queenstown. Accommodations are available along the route in the Aspiring Hut and in the Dart Hut. There is a steep scrambling climb from Aspiring Hut towards the Cascade Saddle itself, reaching a maximum elevation of . The views of Matukituki Valley from the saddle have been reported as ""spectacular"". The route then follows the left bank of the Dart River and includes views of the Dart Glacier.

The tramping route has been highlighted as one of the most dangerous, both in New Zealand and worldwide, due to the hazardous alpine nature of the track. The route is maintained by the Department of Conservation, who recommend it is best attempted by experienced trampers. A 2014 proposal to install safety rails was not adopted, partly so as not to encourage attempts by less-experienced hikers.

Incidents

320,19069,75525911,10241,Ancalagon the Black,"Ancalagon, or Ancalagon the Black, is a dragon that appears in the legends of British writer J. R. R. Tolkien, and particularly in his novel The Silmarillion.

Bred by Morgoth in the depths of his fortress of Angband, Ancalagon is present at the last battle of the First Age, which sees the battle between the armies of the Valar and Morgoth to free Middle-earth from the latter's yoke. Morgoth, seeing his armies in disarray, unveils, as a last resort, the winged dragons led by Ancalagon the Black. Eärendil and Thorondor are confronted by Ancalagon in an aerial battle in which the dragon is shot down, bringing down the peaks of Thangorodrim and defeating its master. This story was probably inspired by the battle between the biblical dragon Satan and the Archangel Michael in the Book of Revelation.

The first flying dragon to appear in the story, it also marks a turning point in Tolkien's physical evolution of this species.

 Features 

 Names 

The name ""Ancalagon"" is explained in The Lost Road and Other Writings as ""impetuous jaws"" or ""biting storm"", from Sindarin anc(a) ""jaw, bite"" and alag ""impetuous"" or alagos ""windstorm"". In his English-language version of the Quenta, Tolkien translates Ancalagon as Anddraca, from and-, an oppositional prefix, and draca ""dragon"". As with other names he has ""translated"" into Old English, Tolkien does not seek identity of meaning, but rather to achieve sounds close to those of the original names.

 Description 

The description of Ancalagon is kept to a minimum. Considered ""the greatest of all dragons"", Ancalagon is the first of the winged dragons. Black in color, its name suggests an impressive jaw. Despite its power, in The Lord of the Rings, Gandalf tells Frodo that Ancalagon would not have been able to destroy the One Ring:

 History 

At the end of the First Age, in the year 587, a few years after the fall of Gondolin and the destruction of the kingdom of Doriath, Eärendil and Elwing set sail for Valinor to convince the Valar to save Middle-earth from the yoke of Morgoth. Thanks to their intervention, the armies of the Valar led by Eönwë, the herald of Manwë, Finarfin king of the Ñoldor of Aman, Ingwë king of the Vanyar, and Eärendil flying in Vingilot, march towards Thangorodrim, beneath which lies Morgoth's fortress, where they are joined by the armies of the Edain.

Morgoth brings most of his armies out of Angband, but they are quickly routed by the Valar forces. Sensing that victory was slipping from his grasp, he called in his reserve forces, the first winged dragons, led by Ancalagon the Black. So terrible was the force of the attack that ""the armies of the Valar retreated before the thunder, lightning and hurricane of flames that preceded the dragons"". However, Eärendil on his ship Vingilot, accompanied by Thorondor leading an armada of birds, battled Ancalagon and the other dragons for ""a whole day and night of doubt"", before piercing the dragon. Ancalagon, shot out of the sky, falls on the peaks of Thangorodrim, causing their destruction and ending the War of the Great Wrath. Angband is opened and Morgoth imprisoned by the Valar, sounding the end of the First Age of Middle-earth.

 Versions 

Tolkien makes no mention of Ancalagon in the 1926 Sketch of Mythology and the first version of the Quenta, in the 1930s. There is a draft of the attack of the flying dragons, but Ancalagon does not yet exist. Ancalagon appears in the second version of the Quenta, in the role it will play in the rest of the legendarium. In this version, as well as in its later rewriting, the pre-1937 Quenta Silmarillion, Ancalagon has wings of steel.

In later versions, notably in the 1969 essay The Problem of Ros, Tolkien suggests that Ancalagon may have been felled by Túrin, who returned after its death from the outer void of Arda to fight in the Final Battle, according to a prophecy of Andreth. However, it is not clear whether Tolkien is talking about the War of the Great Wrath (Christopher Tolkien's hypothesis) or the Dagor Dagorath, the battle that marks the end of the world (John D. Rateliff's hypothesis).

 Analysis 

The figure of Ancalagon is compared with the dragon Miðgarðsormr, who confronts Thor at Ragnarök, as well as with its biblical counterpart, the dragon representing Satan, who is confronted by the Archangel Michael according to a prophecy told in the story of the Apocalypse in the Book of Revelation. The reference to Tolkien's linguistic essay, Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth, published in Morgoth's Ring, which brings Andreth's prophecy into play, enhances ""Ancalagon's mythological importance within the legendarium"", as does the parallel with Miðgarðsormr.

Despite its limited role, the character is of paramount importance, both for its role in its master's downfall, but also for the evolution of the dragon race, as the first flying dragon. Rateliff regrets that the fight between Ancalagon and Eärendil is not more detailed. According to Kristin Larsen, this confrontation is a euhemeric rendering of a meteor shower falling on Venus, the star corresponding to Eärendil in Tolkien's mythology. The battle is described by Evans as ""titanic"" and Ancalagon's fall as ""cataclysmic"".

 Adaptations and legacy 

The battle between Ancalagon the Black and Eärendil has been illustrated by Ted Nasmith. Jenny Dolfen also drew the dragon.

327,41490,76162721,12357,Galesburg Yard," 
The Galesburg Yard is a classification yard of the BNSF Railway south of Galesburg in Illinois. It dates back to a goods and classification yard of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q), which from 1905 developed into one of the largest classification yards in the USA. At the beginning of the 20th century, Galesburg developed into CB&Q's most important railroad junction, with the main lines from Saint Paul to St. Louis and Kansas City (north-south) and from Chicago to Omaha and Kansas City (east-west) running through it. Nearly all CB&Q's passenger and freight trains passed through Galesburg, where there was also a large railroad depot with several roundhouses. 
 
The CB&Q was absorbed by the Burlington Northern Railroad (BN) in 1970, which modernized the yard until 1984. In 1995, the BN merged with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway to form today's BNSF Railway (Burlington Northern Santa Fe), which expanded the Galesburg Yard to 62 directional tracks by 1997 due to its importance for the newly created network. By 2004, these were reduced to 48 to enlarge the entry group. After the Argentine Yard in Kansas City and the Northtown Yard in Minneapolis, it is now the third largest classification yard in the BNSF Railway network.

 History 

In the early 1850s, the Chicago and Aurora Railroad extended its line further west towards Galesburg, reached by the end of 1854. James Frederick Joy later extended the network to the Mississippi River as far as Burlington and Quincy by acquiring smaller railroad companies. Subsequently, it expanded with the new Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q) to St. Paul in the north, St. Louis in the south, and the Missouri River as far west as Kansas City and Omaha and beyond. Joy created one of the most successful railroad companies of the 19th century in America, whose most important junction between the north-south and east-west connections was the city of Galesburg in Illinois.

In addition to a freight and passenger station, a large railroad depot with several roundhouses was built here, and was further expanded with the increase in rail traffic at the beginning of the 20th century. In addition, in 1905 the CB&Q built a large marshalling yard south of it, which extended over five kilometers along the connection to Quincy in the southwest. It consisted of two parallel flat yards with a hump for north and southbound traffic. Each of the successive railroad fields had six tracks in the entry group, 21 in the directional harp, and six in the exit group; the total track length of the classification yard was about 50 km.

In 1914, over 200 trains passed through Galesburg daily, 130 of which were freight trains. Up to 7000 freight wagons were reassembled daily at the classification yard, for which 32 switcher locomotives were used.  A production facility for railroad ties has been located at the southern end of the classification yard since 1908, where the wooden ties for a large part of the CB&Q rail network were processed, impregnated, and stored. The annual processing volume here was 1.5 million ties, and the plant is now managed by Koppers. 
CB&Q modernized the classification yard in the 1930s and 1940s and automated the operation of the two flat yards, which were expanded to a total of over 60 track kilometers. In 1947, around 6000 freight wagons were shunted daily, in 1963 the figure was still 5500. Despite the decline in passenger traffic, around 80 trains still passed through the Galesburg Yard every day in the 1960s. With the expansion of the road network in the USA, passenger and freight traffic increasingly shifted to the roads, which made the large rail networks in North America increasingly unprofitable from the 1960s onwards and subsequently led to several bankruptcies and mergers of railroad companies. 
 
In 1970, the CB&Q merged with several other companies to form the Burlington Northern Railroad (BN), which modernized the marshalling yard again in the early 1980s. By 1984, the track systems had been completely rebuilt for 80 million US dollars, whereby the original separation of the flat stations according to traffic direction and the consecutive arrangement of the track fields were abandoned. This made longer tracks possible in the respective groups; the entry and exit groups (5 tracks each) were then located above the track harp (32 tracks) and partially enclosed it with their extensions. This arrangement still exists today and the trains are transferred between the groups via corresponding escape tracks. The maximum daily capacity after the conversion was 2500 freight wagons.
 

As part of the conversion, the old depot at the northern end of the marshalling yard, including the roundhouse, was also demolished and replaced by a modern maintenance shed for diesel locomotives. The rectangular shed with two continuous tracks - as well as other facilities for refueling - are now located on the west side of the site, above the directional harp.

 Facility 

In 1995, the BN merged with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway to form today's BNSF Railway (Burlington Northern Santa Fe), which expanded the Galesburg Yard several times due to its importance for the newly created network, while retaining the existing layout of the track fields. The yard has occupied almost the same area for over 100 years, stretching from the southern outskirts of Galesburg over five kilometers to the southwest. Starting in the north, the tracks today are divided into the entry group and the exit group, each with eight tracks over two kilometers long, followed by the directional siding. The hump is located at the southern end of the group and the freight wagons are pushed northwards into the sidings. The directional group was enlarged to 48 tracks in 1996 and a year later to 62. The entry and exit groups were also given additional tracks. Another redesign took place in 2004, when 14 directional tracks were removed to extend the entry group to over 2.4 km.

On the west side, next to the exit group, there is the depot for the maintenance of diesel locomotives, and opposite on the east side, a smaller maintenance hall for freight wagons. There are also several bypass tracks on the east side, which are used for block trains with bulk goods. These do not require any en route maintenance and only the train crew is changed in Galesburg. At the southern end, there is also a maintenance area for rail service vehicles for track inspection and maintenance of way and the railroad tie plant now operated by Koppers.",2024-02-28,"['Galesburg, Illinois' 'BNSF Railway' 'Rail yards in Illinois'

328,49558,76412541,4505,Kermitops,"Kermitops (meaning ""Kermit face"") is an extinct genus of amphibamiform temnospondyl from the Early Permian Clear Fork Formation of Texas, United States. The genus contains a single species, K. gratus, known from a partial cranium.

 Discovery and naming 

The Kermitops holotype specimen, USNM 407585, was discovered by Nicholas Hotton III and field scientists from the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History in April 1984. The type locality is represented by the lower sediments of the Clear Fork Formation near Lake Kemp in Wilbarger County, Texas, United States. The specimen consists of most of the skull roof, a partial braincase, and the mandibles. Most of the palate is not preserved, except for some incomplete vomerine teeth. The marginal teeth are not readily observable.

In 2024, So, Pardo & Mann described Kermitops gratus as a new genus and species of amphibamiforms based on these fossil remains. The generic name, ""Kermitops"", combines a reference to Kermit the Frog—the famous amphibian character from the Muppets—with the Greek suffix ""-ops"", meaning face. The specific name, ""gratus"", means ""gratitude"" in Latin, honoring Nicholas Hotton III and the others who aided in collecting the holotype specimen.

 Classification 
In their 2024 description, So, Pardo & Mann performed multiple phylogenetic analyses; the fossil skull preserves an ossified element that may represent the basioccipital, and the coding of this character as ""present"" or ""absent"" altered their results. In their Bayesian inference analyses, Kermitops was consistently recovered as the sister taxon to Plemmyradytes. The cladogram with the basioccipital scored as ""present"" is displayed below:",2025-03-31,"['Temnospondyli' 'Permian temnospondyls of North America'

329,59735,76726100,4590,N103B,"N103B (also known as SNR 0509–68.7) is a supernova remnant located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. It is relatively close to Earth, allowing astronomers to observe and study the remnant. It lies a short distance from NGC 1850. The exact type of supernova that produced N103B is under speculation, but has been widely accepted to be a Type Ia supernova. It is within the boundaries of the constellation Mensa.

 Morphology 
The orange-red filaments visible in the image show the shock fronts of the initial supernova explosion. These filaments have allowed astronomers to calculate the original barycenter of the explosion. The filaments also show that the explosion is no longer expanding as a sphere, but is elliptical in shape. Astronomers assume that part of material ejected by the explosion interacting with an extremely dense cloud of interstellar material, which slowed its speed. N103B is theorized to be interacting with dense circumstellar matter.

A double-ring structure is visible within N103B, implying that it expands into an hourglass-shaped cavity and forms bipolar bubbles.

 Supernova 
Using the Chandra Telescope, astronomers observed N103B to figure out the initial supernova type. Due to the type of material and the amount of specific materials within N103B, astronomers were able to support the widely accepted belief that it was formed from a Type Ia supernova.",2024-05-02,['Supernova remnants' 'Large Magellanic Cloud' 'Mensa (constellation)'],"['supernova remnant' 'Large Magellanic Cloud' 'NGC 1850' 'Mensa'

 Operations in Iraq, Jordan, and Syria 

On 18 October 2023, amid the Gaza war, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq began waves of attacks on U.S. bases in both Iraq and Syria, beginning with the launching of a drone strike on al-Asad Airbase which was intercepted.

On 24 October, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed responsibility for multiple drone strikes on US bases in eastern Syria, notably al-Omar oil field in Deir ez-Zor Governorate and al-Shaddadi in the Al-Hasakah Governorate.

On 5 November, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq issued a warning ahead of Antony Blinken's visit to Baghdad, saying ""Antony Blinken, the son of a Jew, is not welcome in Iraq."" As a result of the threats, Blinken wore a bulletproof vest when landing in Baghdad International Airport.

On 9 November, US forces were struck three separate times in 24 hours, including drone strikes in Al-Asad Airbase and Al-Harir Air Base, as well as an IED attack on a patrol near the Mosul Dam.

On 20 November, eight US and coalition soldiers were injured from a ballistic missile attack, and there was minor infrastructural damage after the air base was attacked by a ballistic missile.

On 25 December, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed responsibility for a drone attack on the base which injured three US soldiers, one being critical.

On 18 January 2024, the Islamic Resistance of Iraq claimed it shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper drone after it took off from Kuwait near Muqdadiyah, Diyala Governorate.
 
On 20 January 2024, the group claimed a missile attack on the Ain Al-Asad Air Base in Al Anbar Govenorate, injuring two US personnel and one Iraqi personnel.US personnel suffer minor injuries in Iraq base attack: U.S. official, Reutershttps://x.com/irandefense/status/1727839209308787065?s=46&t=UYh7e8DMIsUga4DLC5QNmA

On 28 January, the IRI launched a drone attack on the Tower 22 US military outpost in Rukban, Jordan, killing 3 US soldiers and injuring 47 others.

On 4 February 2024, a drone struck a training ground in Al-Omar field in Deir ez-Zor, eastern Syria, which houses US troops, according to the Syrian Democratic Forces. Though no casualties were reported among US forces, at least seven Kurdish fighters were killed and 18 injured. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed responsibility for the attack. The SDF condemned the attack, and said it had ""every right to respond"".

On 1 April 2024, Abu Ali al-Askari, security chief of Kata'ib Hezbollah, said the organisation was prepared to arm the Islamic Resistance in Jordan. He declared that Kata'ib Hezbollah is ready to provide ""12,000 fighters with light and medium weapons, anti-armor launchers, tactical missiles, millions of rounds of ammunition, and tons of explosives"" to ""defend the Palestinians and avenge the honour of Muslims."" On the same day, al-Tanf garrison in Syria was attacked by a one-way attack drone which was intercepted. Shortly after this announcement, a Jordanian militant attacked an IDF patrol vehicle near the Jordanian-Israeli border and fled. This was the first instance of an attack from Jordan on Israel since the beginning of the war.

 Attacks on Israel 

Since November 2023, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq has claimed responsibility for drone and missile attacks against targets within Israel in retaliation for Israeli attacks on Palestinian civilians in Gaza. The group stated it would continue to ""strike enemy strongholds.""

In late January, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq announced it had entered its second phase of operations which included blockading the Mediterranean maritime routes to Israeli ports and disabling the ports.

In November 2024, US officials confirmed that US and partner forces had intercepted Iraqi kamikaze drones launched against Israel. By late October, the ISI had launched drones on an average of around five times a day. In one 24-hour period in October, the ISI launched eight drones at Israel. 

Shortly after, Israeli news outlets reported that Israel may target the IRI for its campaign against Israel during its wars on Gaza and on Lebanon. Unnamed officials allegedly told outlets that satellites monitored the transfer of ballistic missiles and related equipment from Iran to Iraqi territory.

 Intervention in the Israel–Hezbollah conflict 

On 9 January, the Kata'ib Hezbollah spokesperson Jafar al-Husseini warned that the Islamic Resistance in Iraq would help Hezbollah fight Israel if war erupted between the two sides. This statement came a few weeks after the Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed responsibility for a drone attack on a Karish rig which Lebanon claims to hold sovereignty over. In June 2024, many Iraqi officials within the IRI network vowed to support Hezbollah with soldiers if the conflict with Israel escalated into an all-out war.

On 24 June, Qais al-Khazali, the leader of Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq, stated in a televised speech that if the US continued to support Israel in expanding the war to Lebanon and Hezbollah, the group would begin to attack US interests in Iraq and the Middle East.

 Involvement in the 2024 Iran–Israel conflict 

In Iran's missile and drone strikes against Israel, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq had contributed to the attacks on Israel, alongside Iran, the Yemeni Houthis, and an unidentified faction in Syria. This was by their launch of drones and missiles at targets in Israel. The United States, United Kingdom, and Jordan intercepted many of the drones but many did hit various locations within Israel and the occupied Golan Heights.

In response to alleged Israeli bombardment of Popular Mobilization Forces bases in Iraq, which killed a soldier and injured several others, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed a drone attack targeting Eilat.

 Intervention in the United States–Houthi conflict 

On 11 January, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq said that if Yemen is attacked by the US and UK, ""we will attack the Americans' base with everything in our power"". After the initial US-UK airstrikes on Yemen, there were reports of a bomb and sirens being heard at the US Embassy in Iraq. In the same month, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq launched a drone attack on a US base in Jordan, killing three US soldiers and injuring 47 others.

 U.S. retaliation airstrikes 

On 21 November, a US AC-130-gunship struck a Kata'ib Hezbollah vehicle near Abu Ghraib, Iraq in response to the Islamic Resistance In Iraq's 20 November attack on Ain al Assad Airbase.

On 2 February, the US launched retaliatory airstrikes targeting Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria, in response to an attack that killed three US troops in Jordan. On 7 February, a US drone strike on a vehicle in the Mashtal neighborhood of Baghdad killed a commander of Kata'ib Hezbollah Abu Baqir Al-Saadi.",2025-04-18,"['Anti-American sentiment in the Middle East'

335,28381,75775823,11053,Siege of Geertruidenberg (1351–1352),"The siege of Geertruidenberg (1351–1352) was a long siege of Geertruidenberg Castle during the first of the Hook and Cod wars.

 Context 

 Geertruidenberg and its castle 

In 1345, Geertruidenberg was part of the County of Holland. The town itself was well fortified and was important for the county, not in the least because it was closest to the County of Hainaut, which was in a personal union with Holland and Zeeland. Geertruidenberg was also important as a border town to protect Holland against the Duchy of Brabant.

In 1323, Willem van Duvenvoorde got orders to build what would become Geertruidenberg Castle. About 5 kilometers to the south, Van Duvenvoorde also had the formidable Strijen Castle, his residence as Lord of Oosterhout. He connected the two by a paved road.

Geertruidenberg Castle was a special kind of castle. It was owned by the Count of Holland, and kept by a castellan. The office of castellan was not unusual, but at Geertruidenberg Castle the castellan also happened to be Schout of the town. In 1344 Van Duvenvoorde succeeded in making his right to both offices inheritable. In 1347 or 1348 he invested John II of Polanen with both offices.

 War between Margaret of Hainaut and William V (1349-1354) 
The first of the Hook and Cod wars was fought between Margaret of Hainaut and her son William V. It started with an attack by the Bishop of Utrecht. In August 1350 the situation led to an open revolt by most of the Holland cities led by Delft. In February 1351 Margaret's son William joined the rebellion. His side was called the Cod party. The party that remained loyal to Margaret was called the Hook party.

Margaret tried to subdue William by summoning him to Dordrecht, but failed. In April 1351 the important city of Dordrecht joined the rebellion. In May William made peace with Utrecht. Meanwhile, the Cod party attacked and quickly conquered a lot of the smaller castles of the Hook lords. On 15 June the town of Geertruidenberg joined William's side.

Margaret had succeeded in enlisting the help of England. In May she won the naval Battle of Veere, but when she wanted to press her advantage, her forces were decisively beaten in the 4 July 1351 naval Battle of Zwartewaal on the Oude Maas.

 Siege 

 Position of the defenders (Hooks) 
All that remained of the Hook party in Holland after the July 1351 Battle of Zwartewaal were some castles that the party occupied. For the isolated Brederode Castle, Groot Poelgeest, and Oud Haerlem Castle the situation looked hopeless. Vreeland castle on the border with Utrecht was in a better position, but Geertruidenberg Castle probably had the best chance to hold out.

One of the reasons why Geertruidenberg Castle was so strong, was that it was probably very difficult to cut its supply routes. The Hook Strijen Castle was less than 5 km to the south over a good road. Whether Strijen Castle was a Brabant or a Holland castle was debatable, but its owner Willem van Duvenvoorde was a mighty member of the Hook party. A simple blockade with a few forces would be dangerous, because these could be surprised by a raiding party from Strijen Castle. This is proven by the delay between Geertruidenberg switching to the Cod side on 15 June 1351, and the start of the blockade or siege. This was at least three and a half months later, perhap even more than half a year later.

A second reason for the strength of Geertruidenberg, was that Willem van Duvenvoorde was a very important leader of the Hook party. He was probably its most important leader after Margaret. Van Duvenvoorde was very wealthy and would have used his riches to invest in the defense of Geertruidenberg Castle, and with it Strijen Castle.

A third reason why Geertruidenberg Castle was so strong remained obscure until very recently. In the 16th century, the castle was completely demolished and disappeared out of view. With the scant descriptions and probably unreliable images that survived, historians assumed that Geertruidenberg Castle was a typical medieval square castle with square towers, much like Medemblik Castle or Muiden Castle. The archaeological excavation of the castle in 2001 indeed found a straight wall of at least 32 m long. In 2006 it was followed by an investigation with ground penetrating radar. This indicated that the main castle measured about 50 by 50 m. I.e. Geertruidenberg Castle was about twice the size of the average square castle in Holland.

The defenders were led by Philips I, Lord of Polanen, a younger brother of John II, Lord of Polanen, the lord of Geertruidenberg and castellan of the castle. John II got these fiefs from his father John I, Lord of Polanen, who in turn got them from his half brother of Willem van Duvenvoorde.

 Attackers (Cods) 
After the July 1351 Battle of Zwartewaal, William's Cod party had little reason for concern in Holland itself. In the County of Zeeland however, the (then) major city of Zierikzee was still loyal to Margaret. William obviously gave precedence to this threat, and started a siege of Zierikzee. On 21 August 1351 he made a treaty with Zierikzee. If Margaret would not show up with an army before October 1, the city would submit to William. In case she did, the hostilities would continue. By early October 1351, William was indeed master of Zierikzee.

The besiegers of Geertruidenberg Castle were led by John IV, Lord of Arkel. All the Cod leaders and their henchmen joined the siege. These Cod leaders were: John I, Lord of Egmond, Gerard III van Heemskerk, Gerard van Herlaar, and Jan van der Noordeloos. They were joined by militia from Dordrecht, Haarlem, Delft, Leiden, and Geertruidenberg.

 Siege and surrender
Two dates are given for the start of the siege. Some say it started in October 1351. Others say it started in December 1351. Hunger forced Philips van Polanen to ask for a truce in mid 1352. William V then travelled to Geertruidenberg.

On 22 July 1352, a temporary truce was made. Philips sent his envoy Philips van Tetrode to urge his Hook friends in Breda to send a relief force. In mid-August, the Hook party indeed sent a few hundred cavalry from Breda. These were led by John of Polanen. On 17 August these returned to Brussels, apparently without any result.

On 18 August 1352, Philips van Polanen surrendered Geertruidenberg Castle. Philips and his warriors were allowed to keep the goods they had before the war and were allowed a safe conduct to use them. Similar provisions were made for Philips van Tetrode, Willem van Foreest, Arend Nachtegaal, Wouter van Haarlem, Willem the bastard van Wassenaar, Gijsbrecht Hendrikszoon van de Lek, Philips van Beesd, and Gerrit the Bastard van Tetrode.

 Aftermath 
With the surrender of Geertruidenberg Castle, the war between William and Margaret was almost over. Philips van Polanen and 34 defenders kept their possessions, but chose to go into exile in Breda.

For the members of the Hook party, the outcome of the siege was a bit counterintuitive. E.g. the Geertruidenberg citizens Claes and Philips Nachtegaal lost their goods after William V reconquered Geertruidenberg. Their father Arend (above), who was part of the castle garrison, kept his due to the treaty. John II of Polanen was the official schout of Geertruidenberg and castellan of its castle. He was not part of the defenders of the castle and lost these fiefs. In 1356 he made his peace with William V, but William V retained these fiefs to himself.",2025-02-23,"['Hook and Cod wars' 'History of North Brabant'

339,36293,5352562,9358,Kevin Kenner,"Kevin Kenner (born May 19, 1963, in Coronado, California) is an American concert pianist.

Biography
At the age of 17, Kenner was a finalist at the X International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw. Ten years later, in 1990 he returned to Warsaw and achieved second place at the XII International Chopin Piano Competition and the Special Prize for the Best Performance of a Polonaise. No first prize was awarded that year.  Earlier that year he won the third prize at the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow. Other awards include the International Terence Judd Award (London, 1990), prize for Best Performance of Chamber Music (shared with three others) at the 1989 Van Cliburn International Piano Competition,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cliburn.org/?performer=1989-cliburn-competition|title=Eighth Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, 1989 Awards and Prizes}}</ref> and the Gina Bachauer International Piano Competition (Salt Lake City, Utah 1988).

Kenner has since performed as soloist with world class orchestras including the Hallé Orchestra, the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, the Warsaw Philharmonic, The Czech Philharmonic, the  Belgian Radio and Television Philharmonic Brussels, the NHK Symphony Orchestra, and in the US with the principal orchestras of San Francisco, San Diego, Salt Lake City, Kansas City, New Jersey, Rochester, Baltimore, St. Paul and many others.  He has been invited to work with many renowned conductors, including Sir Charles Groves, Sir Andrew Davis, Hans Vonk, Stanislaw Skrowaczewski, Jerzy Maksymiuk, Kazimierz Kord, Jiri Belohlavek and Antoni Wit.

His achievements have won him critical acclaim from all over the world. He has been praised as ""one of the finest American pianists to come along in years"" (Howard Reich, Chicago Tribune), ""...fulfilling a criterion which one only knows from great Chopinists such as Rubinstein, Benedetti-Michelangeli and Dinu Lipatti"" (Winfried Wild, Schwaebische Zeitung, Germany).  Adrian Jack of London's Independent describes one of Kenner's recitals as ""...the best performance I have ever heard in the concert hall of all four of Chopin's Ballades"". The Financial Times in London described Kenner as a ""player of grace, subtle variety and strength, with a mature grasp of dramatic structure and proportion: in short, a grown-up musician nearing his peak.""  And the Washington Post recently proclaimed him ""a major talent ... an artist whose intellect, imagination and pianism speak powerfully and eloquently.""  The conductor Stanislaw Skrowaczewski, who recorded with pianists such as Arthur Rubinstein, claimed Kenner's Chopin interpretations to be the most sensitive and beautiful he remembered.

He has performed chamber music with the Tokyo String Quartet, the Endellion String Quartet, the Vogler String Quartet and the Panocha Quartet, among many others.  He has toured with the Piazzoforte String Quintet, performing arrangements of Ástor Piazzolla.

Along with his concert appearances, Kenner has given masterclasses for many years at the International Piano Festival in Krynica, Poland as well as in major centres in Japan and America. More recently he has been giving classes at the International Summer Music Academy in Kraków, Poland.  He has also been invited to adjudicate in international music competitions in Asia, Europe and the US. Since 2001 he has been engaged as a professor of piano at the Royal College of Music, London, and some of his students have gone on to win prizes in international piano competitions. Since 2011, when he met violinist Kyung-wha Chung at the Great Mountains Festival, they have created a performance partnership. They have worked together on an album and had multiple tours.

Kevin Kenner's recordings include many discs of Chopin works as well as recordings of Ravel, Schumann and Piazzolla. The latter was awarded a “Fryderyk”'' in Poland in 2012 as best CD of the year under the category Chamber Music.

Kenner was a member of the jury at the XVI International Chopin Piano Competition in 2010, the XVIII International Chopin Piano Competition in 2021, and will serve on the jury again at the XIX International Chopin Piano Competition in 2025.

An estimated mob of 3,000 Meitei assailants, some with sophisticated weapons, launched an attack on the Kuki villages in the Khamenlok valley, over a period of three days, burning houses and rampaging the area. While the Kuki villagers escaped to the hills on arrival of the assailants, security forces were blocked from reaching the area by women activist groups. Finally, on the night of 13–14 June, while the assailants were celebrating in a church building, the Kuki village defence volunteers descended from the hills and carried out a wholesale massacre of the Meitei mobs. The official death count was nine people, but unofficial estimates were in excess of 200 people.Vijaita Singh, Iboyaima Laithangbam, Retaliatory strike by village guards leaves nine dead in Manipur, The Hindu, 14 June 2023.

 Background 
 Manipur violence 
The 2023–2025 Manipur violence broke out on 3 May 2023, soon after a protest rally held by the tribal communities of Manipur. Starting out as clashes between the Meitei and Kuki (tribal) communities of Manipur at the border between Churachandpur and Bishnupur districts, the ethnic violence soon spun out of control engulfing the whole state. All the Meiteis living in the hill districts dominated by Kukis fled their homes and the Kukis living in the Imphal Valley did likewise, causing widespread displacement of over 60,000 people lasting a whole year while the violence continued unabated. The Meitei community has developed organised militias such as Arambai Tenggol and Meitei Leepun, which looted state police armouries to gain advanced weaponry,and used it to wage war against the tribal districts inhabited by Kukis.The Kukis, who possess licensed guns due to their hunting occupation, attempted to organise ""village defence volunteers"", while the security forces created ""buffer zones"" to keep the two sides apart. Both the sides possessed insurgent groups, whose role in the violence remained unclear.

 Khamenlok valley 
The Kangpokpi District, which surrounds the northern Imphal Valley on three sides, is mainly inhabited by Kukis. The jurisdiction of the Valley districts (Imphal West and Imphal East) has been extended over the decades to include the river valleys that feed into Imphal, thus encroaching into the hill areas which otherwise belonged to the Kangpokpi district. These extensions are controversial, causing uncertain borders between the valley districts and Kangpokpi district.Vijaita Singh, Several hill villages in Manipur wrongly included in valley districts: ST panel, The Hindu, 11 September 2023. ""A report by the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) has observed that several hill villages in Manipur were wrongly included in the valley districts during the Census 2011 exercise.""

A portion of the Iril River valley (also called Saikul Valley) has been part of Imphal East since 1971, but the census map of 2001 shows it extending almost up to the border of the Saikul Town. The Khamenlok valley is a branch valley of the Saikul Valley, extending from a village called Uyumpok. Near the mouth of the valley is a Meitei village called Nongsum, and, next to it, a Tangkhul Naga village called Khongbal. These two are included in the Imphal East district. The remainder of the Khamenlok Valley has numerous Kuki villages, which are part of the Kangpokpi district. These are, in order, H. Khopibung, Khamenlok, Chullouphai, Aigejang, A. Leikot, A. Phainom, Thombol, T. Jordanphai, Songjang and Govajang.Kaybie Chongloi, Manipur: Khamenlok area chiefs 'call bluff' on reports of violence against Meiteis, EastMojo, 17 June 2023.

Uyumpok is a large village with numerous sub-villages (total population: 2899), and to its north is Sagolmang (population: 967). Sagolmang has a police station, whose jurisdiction extends to the Khamenlok Valley, even though it is in a different revenue district.Prabin Kalita, Man killed in Manipur as guv visits relief camp in district, The Times of India, 13 June 2023.

 Clashes 
 12 June 
On Monday, 12 June, by 10:45 am, armed assailants raided the Khopibung and Khamenlok villages, firing at the ""group of civilians"", and setting houses on fire. By the time Assam Rifles and Gorkha Rifles troops arrived at the village, the gunmen are said to have fled the area. The Times of India report said that three people were injured.Man killed in Manipur as guv visits relief camp in district, The Times of India, 13 June 2023.

Manipur Turmoil: Fierce gunfight at Khamenlok, nine injured, Imphal Free Press, 12 June 2023.  The Imphal Free Press provided the information that, as soon as the news about the gun battle was circulated, ""women folks"" (Meira Paibis) in the Khurai Lamlong Keithel area (a suburb of Imphal City on the route to Khamenlok) blocked the roads, so that the (central) armed forces could not reach the area. Indian Reserve Battalion (IRB) commandos, made up of Meitei personnel, are said to have reached the spot, however.

In contradiction to the above reports, Sagolmang police claimed that ""suspected Kuki militants"" from Khopibung and Khamenlok villages were attacking the Nongsum village, and that the latter's ""village volunteers"" were defending themselves, despite admitting that the gunfight was taking place at the Khamenlok village. Having reproduced these claims, the Imphal Free Press corrected itself two days later by admitting that the Kuki villages were ""already ... burnt down by village volunteers"".Three more villages burned down in Khamenlok area, Imphal Free Press, 14 June 2023.  This portrayal of ""Kuki militants"" and ""(Meitei) village volunteers"" was later criticised by the Indian Army, which said that the (Meitei) assailants were a ""mob"".Manipur FIRs: Nearly 2 months before Editors Guild report, army letter pointed to 3 cases, ‘media bias’, Newslaundry, 12 September 2023.

The chief of Khopibung also criticised the Imphal media reports stating that the Kuki villagers were ""scattered"" (fled from the villages into the hills) and he was having to spend great efforts for gathering them again. He also revealed that four Kuki village volunteers had received bullet injuries.

 13–14 June 
On 13 June, an estimated mob of 3,000 people went to attack the Khamenlok valley, some carrying sophisticated weapons. According to the Imphal Free Press, after a few hours of firing, the villages Khopibung, Khamenlok, Aigejang and Chullouphai were burnt down. However, the village chiefs of the area said that all the Kuki villages in Khamenlok valley sustained destruction. Meitei women's groups again blocked roads and also blew up mobile towers, so that armed forces could not reach the area, and communications also became unavailable.

Late in the night, after 10 pm, while the Meitei mobs were celebrating or resting, Kuki villagers descended from the hills and attacked the Meiteis. They were described as coming with guns, spears, daggers, cleavers and other traditional weapons. 
Early reports the next day said that eleven Meiteis were killed, and 23 Meiteis were injured.IANS, Militants gun down 11 people in Manipur, Nagaland Post, 14 June 2023.

The official narrative said that the nine Meitei people killed were in a church building in the village of Aigejang. The surviving victims claimed that they had gone to deliver food to the Meitei mobs, while the Meitei fighters themselves were supposedly at other locations.

 Aftermath 
On 20 June, thousands of villagers including those from the Khamenlok area protested in Saikul, saying ten villages of Khamenlok were burnt down. They questioned the prime minister's silence and sought his immediate intervention.Saikul protests torching of Khamenlok's villages, seeks PM's intervention, Northeast Live, 20 June, 2023.

On 24 June, a memorial was held for the nine Meitei people killed in the clash.

The News Minute wrote in August that, even two months after the clash, journalists were not allowed access to the Khamenlok area. Meitei vigilante groups including Meira Paibis made sure that nobody entered the villages.

 Editors Guild of India investigation 
On 12 July, the Indian Army's Information Warfare wing wrote to the Editors Guild of India, raising the issue of bias in Imphal media. The reporting on Khamenlok clash was cited as one of the examples of biased reporting. The letter cited a ""mob"" attacking the Khamenlok village and the adjoining areas, which was duly supported by womenfolk (Meira Paibis) that blocked Army troops from reaching the village. After carrying out arson of multiple villages, the members of the mob or those supporting them were killed in a ""retaliatory strike"". Notwithstanding the truth, the letter said that the newspapers in Imphal covered the incident as civilians being killed by ""Kuki militants"". This and other similar examples were ""outright (mis)representation of facts"", the Army said, and saw such reporting as a major contributor to the instigation of further violence. It invited the Editors Guild of India to investigate the media bias of Imphal media.'Bias of Manipur Media Towards a Community, Total Misrepresentation of Facts': Army's Letter to EGI, The Wire, 12 September 2023.

The Editors Guild of India sent a team of three senior editors who investigated the allegations and confirmed that the Imphal media reported fake news and spread disinformation, which progressively deepened the ethnic divide in Manipur. Their report also called out the Imphal media for vilifying security forces, which was being tacitly supported by the state government and Manipur Police.Journalists in Manipur wrote ‘one-sided reports’, says Editors Guild fact-finding team, Scroll.in, 3 September 2023.Govt ‘partisan’, fake news in Manipur media deepening divide: Editors’ Guild fact-finding report, Newslaundry, 2 September 2023. In the section titled ""Fake News and Disinformation"", the report wrote:

This was one among a dozen examples cited for fake news and disinformation.

The chief minister N. Biren Singh reacted angrily to the report claiming that the Editors Guild of India had ""no authority"" to constitute a fact-finding team and carry out an investigation in Manipur. He directed the state government to file an FIR against the members of the Editors Guild who, he claimed, were ""trying to create more clashes"" in Manipur.FIR in Manipur against Editors Guild for report on media coverage of conflict, Scroll.in, 4 September 2023.India's Manipur charges four journalists over report into ethnic violence, Reuters, 5 September 2023.

342,517,5250577,9887,Strängnäs Cathedral,"Strängnäs Cathedral () is a Lutheran cathedral church in Strängnäs, Sweden, since the Protestant Reformation the seat of the Church of Sweden Diocese of Strängnäs.

Architecture

Construction of the cathedral began in about 1260 with inaugurated in 1291; additions were created during the 1300s and 1400s. In 1330 the core church itself was completed and it was later supplemented during the Middle Ages with a sacristy, towers and lateral choirs. The present characteristic Baroque-style tower hood was built in 1723.

It is built mainly of bricks in the characteristic Scandinavian Brick Gothic style. The original church was built of wood, probably during the first decades of the 12th century, on a spot where pagan rituals used to take place and where the missionary Saint Eskil was killed during the mid 11th century. The wooden church was not rebuilt in stone and bricks until 1340, just after Strängnäs became a diocese.

The cathedral contains a mixture of decorative styles. The nave, chancel, and sanctuary are highly traditional, with a very large triptych reredos dominating the high altar at the east end of the building. However, two of the side chapels have been refurbished in highly contemporary style, with modern altars, and abstract artistic decoration and religious symbolism.

Prominent burials
The cathedral contains the tombs of Charles IX of Sweden, Sten Sture the Elder, Maria of Palatinate-Simmern and Gustaf Otto Stenbock. On 31 July 2018, the burial regalia (two crowns and an orb) of Charles IX and Christina of Holstein-Gottorp were stolen in a daylight robbery with the thieves escaping by boat.
 In February 2019 it was reported that the regalia had been found and a man was facing trial accused of the theft.

Strängnäs Cathedral Library
Strängnäs Cathedral Library is one of the oldest surviving and working libraries in Sweden. It dates its origin to the year 1316 when Strängnäs Dominican monastery (according to a record kept by a will) received a widow's donation of books. The library was then built consciously by the bishops Kort Rogge and John Matthiæ. During the 1600s, it was expanded by Christina, Queen of Sweden, through the addition of the spoils of war, especially from the cities of Prague, Olmutz and Nikolsburg. During the 1700s the library expanded through gifts and bequests from learned diocesan clergy. During the 1800s it was kept in the former school building's main hall, and is now in the special Library chancel in the cathedral's northwestern corner. Dr Henrik Aminson (1814-1885) published in 1863 a comprehensive printed directory Bibliotheca Templi Cathedralis Stregnensis, quae maximam partem ex Germania Capta est circa finem belli triginta annorum, descripta, 1-2, of over 600 pages. Most of the printed books are listed in Libris, the Swedish libraries search service. A printed catalogue in two volumes was published in 2017 (Ragnhild Lundgren, Strängnäs domkyrkobibliotek. Systematisk katalog över tryckta böcker).

344,34458,75968826,20049,1967 24 Hours of Daytona,"The 1967 24 Hours of Daytona was an endurance sports car race that took place on 4 and 5 February 1967 at the  Daytona International Speedway road course in Daytona Beach, Florida. It was the sixth running of the Daytona Continental endurance race, and the second time the event was held as a 24-hour race. It was also the opening round of the 1967 World Sportscar Championship.

Chris Amon and Lorenzo Bandini won the race for Ferrari with its new 330 P4 model, leading a 1–2–3 finish for the marque.

 Race 
In the 1960s, Ford and Ferrari were involved in an endurance racing rivalry, which arose after the Italian manufacturer refused to be bought by the Americans. Thus, Ford decided to enter endurance racing in 1964, which eventually paid off in 1966 with victories at the 24 Hours of Daytona, the 12 Hours of Sebring and the 24 Hours of Le Mans, as well as the overall victory in the World Sportscar Championship. For the 24 Hours of Daytona in 1967, Ford entered as many cars as possible to maximize its chances of another victory. There were six factory cars at the start, three each from Shelby American and Holman & Moody, supplemented by a number of private entries. The factory teams used Mk.II Ford GT40s, while the private teams participated with Mk.I models. However, Ferrari had not stood still in the winter of 1966 either. Technical director Mauro Forghieri was given complete freedom by team boss Enzo Ferrari to design new cars and engines. As a result, the team introduced the new Ferrari 330 P4, of which two examples were entered into the race: an open-top ""Spyder"" numbered 23 and a closed-top ""Berlinetta"" numbered 24. The former was an ex-P3 chassis converted to P4 specifications (sometimes referred to as a P3/4), while the latter was a brand new P4. In addition to the two works entries, privateer teams entered two 412 P models, which was a less sophisticated version of the P4 intended for customers. Despite the high costs, Ferrari traveled to Daytona for a test session in December 1966.

In qualifying, the Ford of Dan Gurney and A. J. Foyt took pole position, just two tenths ahead of the Chaparral 2F of Phil Hill and Mike Spence. Ferrari's first factory car, the No. 23 of Chris Amon and Lorenzo Bandini, started fourth, behind the private entry of Pedro Rodríguez and Jean Guichet. Immediately after the start, Hill took the lead, and after half an hour he had a twenty second lead over Gurney. Ford and Ferrari, meanwhile, focused on their own lap times and decided not to push hard for the lead unless the it increased to more than five laps.

After three hours the Chaparral spun and had to retire, allowing the No. 24 Ferrari of Mike Parkes and Ludovico Scarfiotti to take the lead. The other Chaparral of Bob Johnson and Bruce Jennings also had to abandon the race. Ford's cars suffered from many mechanical problems, such as defective seals and transaxles, and had to be brought in one by one for long pit stops or retirements. Ford's mechanics made more and more repairs, but eventually almost all of the manufacturer's cars had to retire. Gurney and Foyt had to have a transmission replaced and were still fifth, but six hours before the finish they also had to give up. The only Ford factory car that could still threaten Ferrari, the No. 1 of Bruce McLaren and Lucien Bianchi, had to significantly reduce its speed due to overheating. This entry eventually finished the race in seventh place, 73 laps behind the winner.

With half an hour remaining until the finish, three Ferraris occupied the first three positions. They reduced their speed so that they could cross the finish line side by side. This was in response to Ford's photo finish at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans. Unlike in that race, where the two leading cars had completed the same distance and it was not initially clear who had won, the leading No. 23 Ferrari was three laps ahead of the second-placed No. 24 entry, while the NART-entered 412 P finished a further 26 laps behind in third. The photo taken of this finish was kept in Enzo Ferrari's office for a long time. The first Ford, the private J. W. Automotive entry of Dick Thompson and Jacky Ickx, finished sixth, behind two Porsches. The race is referred to as ""Enzo's revenge"" by various media outlets. Ferrari led for more than twenty hours during the entire race.

348,27063,5323334,11425,Lake Almanor,"Lake Almanor is a large reservoir in northwestern Plumas County, northeastern California, United States. The reservoir has a capacity of  and a maximum depth of about . The surface area is 43.75 square miles (11,331.2 hectares). It is formed by Canyon Dam on the North Fork of the Feather River, as well as Benner and Last Chance Creeks, Hamilton Branch, and various natural springs.

Creation

The dam is  tall and composed of hydraulic fill.

The first dam was completed by Great Western Power in 1914 as part of the Upper North Fork Feather River Project, damming the North Fork of the Feather River and flooding the meadow-filled valley generally known as Nakam Koyo/Big Meadows/Big Springs, a longstanding Yamani Maidu village site.Golla, Victor. 2011. California Indian Languages. University of California PressThe Northern Maidu. Roland B. Dixon. 1905. Bulletin of the Museum of Natural History Vol. XVIII, Part III, pp. 119-346. Huntington California Expedition When the dam was built, Maidu families still living in the vicinity were displaced, while parts of the town of Prattville had to be moved to higher ground, leaving multiple structures flooded over. The reservoir was named for the three daughters of Guy C. Earl, Vice President of Great Western Power: Alice, Martha and Eleanor.1500 California Place Names: Their Origin and Meaning by William Bright. University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1998. The present dam, which more than doubled the lake's size, was constructed by Great Western Power from 1926 to 1927.

The dam is now owned by Pacific Gas and Electric Company. PG&E uses it for hydroelectricity production, but the lake is also a popular recreation area, with fishing, boating, water skiing, swimming and camping available.

The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has issued safe eating advice based on mercury for fish caught from Lake Almanor.

Geography

The lake-front and immediate surroundings are, either officially or unofficially, divided into a series of regions:

 North Shore, typically referring to the north-east shoreline and the campground of the same name
 The Peninsula, the major east-side peninsula bisecting the lake and largely taken up by the Lake Almanor Country Club, the community of Almanor, and the more recent residential developments known as Bailey Creek and Foxwood
 Hamilton Branch, the east-side community next south of the Peninsula, named for the river of the same name
 East Shore, both the developed and undeveloped areas between Hamilton Branch and the dam itself
 Canyon Dam (also known as Canyondam), the community just southeast of the dam
 South Shore, the southwest shoreline taken up largely by PG&E managed campgrounds and undeveloped grounds
 Prattville, the small resort community on the southwest shoreline; retains the same name as the town that was once in Big Meadows (now underwater)
 West Shore, on the upper southwest shore and more formally referred to as Lake Almanor West, itself an un-gated country-club
 The generally nameless western shoreline from Lake Almanor West to the town of Chester, starting at Goose Bay and ending at the termination of the large diversion channel that mitigates high-waters in the Feather River above Chester
 The northern shoreline from Chester, running northeast then southwest, and back to Hwy 36; includes the mouth of Benner and Last Chance creeks and seasonal springs

Much of the southern shore of the lake is in the Lassen National Forest, so recreation management is shared by PG&E and the United States Forest Service.

Large areas along the northern shore of the lake are seasonal pastures used for summer and fall cattle grazing; some areas of these grazing grounds are underwater in wetter years. The wetlands at the north end also serve as breeding grounds for a variety of migratory waterfowl, most prominently Canada geese and various species of ducks including mallard, teal, and wigeon. Other large birds to be viewed around the lake are heron, osprey, and occasionally bald eagles, which nest on the Peninsula and West Shore. Each year in late June and early July, large insect hatches occur on the lake during dusk. The insects on which the fish feed attract local fly fishermen who use imitation flies to catch the feeding fish.

The Almanor Basin Watershed Advisory Committee Group (ABWAC) received funding for a Watershed Assessment Project under California Prop 12, and one deliverable from this project was in an online map-based database of watershed information that runs on Google Earth. A tour can be downloaded.

Thermal curtain
PG&E's 50-year license to use the waters of Lake Almanor was set to expire in 2004 when the state water board explored requests to install a thermal curtain at the bottom of Lake Almanor to control the temperature of the rivers downstream. This was ostensibly to create better habitat for trout habitat up to 40 miles downstream. However, residents near Lake Almanor became concerned that the curtain would help the trout downstream at the cost of raising the water temperatures of shallow Lake Almanor and harming its fish population. By doing so, the residents would not have easy access to the lake's fish.

Power production
There is no powerhouse at the dam.Image of the Outlet tower to the Butt Valley Powerhouse tunnel near Prattville A tunnel (and finally a penstock) from the powerhouse outlet tower, in the lake between Prattville and the Plumas Pines Resort, delivers water to the Butt Valley Powerhouse at the north end of Butt Valley Reservoir, which has a capacity of 41 MW. From there, the water is sent by tunnel to either the Caribou 1 (74 MW) or Caribou 2 (120 MW) powerhouses. Caribou 2 is favored because it is newer and more efficient. Their tailraces flow into Belden Reservoir. A portion of the water goes through the 1.3-MW Oak Flat Powerhouse, which is located at the bottom of Belden Dam. The rest goes to the 125-MW Belden Powerhouse by another tunnel. The water is then released into Rock Creek Reservoir. As of 2008, all of these powerhouse facilities were owned and operated by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), a major investor-owned California utility.

351,38122,76086297,26503,Muslim Gujjars,"Muslim Gujjars or Musalmān Gujjars () are an ethno-religious group predominantly found in the north-western regions of South Asia. They embraced Islam from the medieval period onwards.

 History 
Origins
Gujjars are an Indo-Aryan agro-pastoral people or tribe, believed to be of either Hunnic or Scythian origins. They settled in the north-western regions of South Asia around the fourth century where they adopted Indic religions.

Medieval period
Conversions of Gujjars to Islam began in the 11th century with the arrival of Sufi missionaries in the subcontinent. Numerous clans of Gujjars embraced Islam during the time of Shaykh Farid al-Din Masud and his successors. By the 16th century, Islam had become the predominant religion among the Gujjars of Punjab, Kashmir, Khyber Paktunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, Sindh, Balochistan and present-day Afghanistan.

Mughal period
The memoirs of Mughal emperors Babur and Jahangir describe the Gujjars as pastoral people engaged in frequent raids and plundering. Sujan Rai writes in the 17th century that the Gujjar tribe of Sarkar Dipalpur was notorious for its refractory and rebellious character.

Following Nadir Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire, several Gujjar chiefs rose to power in Punjab, Hazara, and Kashmir. Notable among them were the Nawabs of Dera Ghazi Khan, the Rajas of Poonch, and the Muqaddams of Kot Najibullah.

British period
Muslim Gujjars were actively involved in the 1857 uprising against the Company rule, particularly in the Punjab region, and were said to have given ""a great deal of trouble"" during the Mutiny.

Later, during the British Raj era, they were classified as a martial race and enlisted in class company regiments.

 Social organisation 
Muslim Gujjars are divided into over 100 clans or gots, which include Khatana, Chechi, Chauhan, Kasana, Paswal, Gorsi, Katariya, Meelu, Bajar and Kalas.

 Demographics 
In 1988, it was estimated that Muslim Gujjars constitute 53 percent of the total Gujjar population.

 Afghanistan 
The Gujjar people have lived in Afghanistan for centuries, with an estimated 1.5 million residing in the country today. They primarily inhabit the northeastern regions, including provinces like Kapisa, Baghlan, Balkh, Kunduz, Takhar, Badakhshan, Nuristan, Laghman, Nangarhar, and Khost. Historically recognized as one of Afghanistan's 14 ethnic groups, the Gujjars have a distinct culture and lifestyle. However, many live in poverty and face marginalization, with some displaced by militias, such as in 2018 in Takhar province. During the COVID-19 pandemic, lack of healthcare led to the use of Andak meat for treatment, despite religious objections. Gujjar leaders have advocated for better infrastructure, including schools and hospitals, and sought government scholarships for their youth.

 Pakistan 
An estimated 20% of Pakistan's population is Gujjars.

In 1999, British anthropologist Stephen Lyon estimated that the Gujjar population in Pakistan was around 30 million. He also introduced the concept of ""Gujarism""—the idea that Gujjars in Pakistan are aware of their distinct identity and frequently engage in social activities, including local political participation, based on this awareness, a phenomenon he refers to as kin-network activism.

 Punjab 
Gujjars are mostly found in Punjab province, where they gave their name to cities and towns such as Gujranwala, Gujar Khan and Gujrat, but for economics reasons recently they have emigrated to cities such as Karachi.

 Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 
Gujjars are also present in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where they're the third largest ethnic groups after the Pashtuns and the Awan, found in the Hazara region as well places like Dir, Swat, and Bajaur, often being conversant in Pashto, the provincial language.

In Swat, Pir Samiullah was a Gujjar community leader who was the first to raise a private tribal army against the Pakistani Taliban, with around 10,000 men, but was eventually defeated and executed by the Taliban in 2008, who then desecrated his dead body by hanging it publicly.

 Azad Kashmir 
In Azad Kashmir, they are one of the region's largest communities, by some estimates even being considered the single largest group with 800,000 individuals.

 Gilgit-Baltistan 
In Gilgit-Baltistan, they are primarily settled in Naltar, Ghizer, and Astore. They migrated over a century ago from Swat, Kohistan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Traditionally pastoralists, they rely on farming and livestock rearing, and are known for their unique tradition of carving wooden coffins.

 Sindh 
Muslim Gujjars are also present in Sindh, with some having migrated from Punjab to cities like Karachi in search of better economic opportunities. Traditionally pastoralists and farmers, many have moved to urban areas in recent years for work.

 India 

 Jammu and Kashmir 
The Gujjars of Jammu and Kashmir are a predominantly Muslim community. In Jammu and Kashmir, Gujjars are mostly nomadic, semi-nomadic, and agro-pastoralists.

Gujjars constitute approximately 88% of the total tribal population in Jammu and Kashmir, with an estimated population of around one million, or 8% of the state's total population. They are the third-largest ethnic group in the region, after Kashmiri Muslims and Dogra Hindus. The community is scattered across the state, with the largest concentration in Poonch (40%) and Rajouri (33.1%), while they are absent in the Leh district.

 Himachal Pradesh 
Muslim Gujjars are found in the Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh, which borders Jammu and Kashmir and Tibet. The majority of them are nomadic, with a smaller number of settled Muslim Gujjars. Traditionally, they are pastoralists, moving with their livestock across the region's mountainous terrain.

 Ladakh 
The Muslim Gujjars and Bakarwal communities in Ladakh are traditionally pastoralists, grazing livestock in areas like Rangdum. Recently, disputes over land encroachment and unauthorized construction have arisen. In 2024, the Lieutenant Governor of Ladakh intervened to address these issues, including the illegal occupation of grazing land and the ongoing legal dispute over land rights in the region.

 Uttarakhand 
The Muslim Gujjars of Uttarakhand, with a population of around 70,000, are a semi-nomadic pastoral community living mainly in the Shivalik Hills, bordering Tibet. Traditionally herders, they practice transhumance, migrating with their buffalo herds between the foothills in winter and alpine pastures in summer. Known for being lactovegetarians, they rely solely on milk from their buffaloes. Despite the Indian Forest Rights Act of 2006 granting them forest land rights, they face conflicts with state authorities over access to reserved parks. The community distinguishes itself from other Gujjars by adopting the prefix ""Van"" (""forest-dwelling"") in the 1980s.

 Uttar Pradesh 
The Muslim Gujjars make up a substantial portion of the population in regions like Kairana and Muzaffarnagar, with an estimated 150,000 Muslim Gujjars in the Kairana constituency alone. This community has historically been influential in local politics, often rallying behind candidates from their ethnicity, irrespective of their religious identity. Despite being a minority in the broader context, Muslim Gujjars in these areas hold a demographic and political sway, particularly in rural settings.

353,33353,75941094,18523,Rukban refugee camp,"The Rukban refugee camp () lies in southern Syria adjacent to the Jordan–Syria border, and close to the tripoint with Iraq. It is named after the nearby Rukban area, an arid remote region in northeastern Jordan.

The camp was established when refugees piled up on the Syrian side of the borders with Jordan in 2014, as it became one of the crossing points for Syrian refugees fleeing the Syrian Civil War. While Jordan welcomed hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, the country specifically blocked the refugees at Rukban from entering, citing security concerns regarding the presence of hidden ISIS sleeper cells.

In 2016, a car passing from the refugee camp in Syria managed to reach a Jordanian army outpost designated for the distribution of humanitarian aid to Syrian refugees. The car exploded, killing 6 and injuring 14 Jordanian soldiers. Jordan thereafter declared its eastern and northern border closed military zones. The camp in Syria witnessed further incidents, including two car bomb attacks that killed tens of refugees in 2016 and 2017.

The population of the camp in Syria peaked at 45,000 in 2018. It suffered poor living conditions until its population later dwindled to 11,000 in 2019.

Following the 2024 Syrian opposition offensives and the fall of the Assad regime, the blockade was ended and some refugees began returning to other parts of Syria.

Background

Rukban is an arid remote area in northeastern Jordan near the borders with Syria. Since 2014, it became one of the crossing points for Syrian refugees going to Jordan. However, Jordan soon after blocked their access, citing security concerns regarding the presence of hidden Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant sleeper cells, as many of the refugees arrived mostly from then Islamic State-controlled territories such as Raqqa. Jordan only allowed around 50 to a 100 of them to pass into the country after strict screening. Therefore, refugees piled up on the border, creating the Rukban refugee camp in Syria.

In 2015, the UN agreed with Jordan that the number of refugees that it is hosting gives rise to legitimate security concerns, however, it did not concede that Rukban residents presented any specific or additional security concern, and called on Jordan to immediately allow refugees in Rukban to access the country. Melessa Flemming of UNHCR said: ""UN officials accept Jordan has legitimate security concerns, but the UN continues to urge Jordan to permit residents of Rukban to enter Jordan."" The number of Syrians there rose to 75,000 in 2016, becoming a de facto camp in Syrian territory, which drew heavy criticism and condemnation of Jordan from Human Rights Watch in 2015.

Syrian Civil War spillover
21 June 2016 car bomb
At dawn on 21 June 2016, a car crossed over from Rukban on Syrian territory and managed to reach a Jordanian army outpost designated for the distribution of humanitarian aid to Syrian refugees. The car exploded, killing 6 and injuring 14 Jordanian soldiers.

Jordanian minister of foreign affairs Nasser Judeh said in a press conference about the incident that ""we don't need a hideous terrorist attack like this one to prove to the world the legitimacy of our security concerns"". He added that Jordan ""will not put the lives of our soldiers and our country at risk because this is not Jordan's problem alone, this is an international responsibility"" and that it ""has provided for refugees what no other country has, with regard to its resources. We will not allow anyone to take the higher moral ground"". Jordan afterwards declared its northern and eastern borders closed military areas, and stressed that the armed forces' border guards will not tolerate any uncoordinated movements approaching its borders and that force will be decisively used against it.

Despite this, HRW continued to condemn Jordan, most recently on 7 September 2016, due to deteriorating life conditions in Rukban after humanitarian aid was halted due to fears from further terror attacks against the Jordanian army and international humanitarian aid agencies.

17 December 2016 car bomb
Another attack happened on 17 December 2016, 3 km north of the border in the refugee camp which lies in Syria. The bombing targeted a warehouse while it was distributing clothes to refugees, resulting in 2 dead and 15 injured Syrians. On 21 January 2017, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a third explosion went off in the camp by a car bomb, in which 4 Syrians were killed and 14 were injured. The injured were evacuated by the Jordanian army into a medical facility.

3 May 2017 car bomb
A Jordanian military source said a car bomb exploded in the market area of the camp on 3 May 2017, killing four Syrians and injuring others. Jordan began blocking aid deliveries to the camp from early 2018.

Later developments
On 23 August 2018, Russian spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed that hundreds of ISIL and Jabhat al-Nusra members were hiding among the refugees inside the camp, using them as human shields, with the knowledge of the U.S. military at the nearby Al-Tanf air base in Syria. In September 2016 Alice Wells, the then-U.S. Ambassador to Jordan, made the claim that the refugee camp housed a variety of different people possibly including armed groups and terrorists. However, the prevalence of IS fighters in the camp is disputed by the camp's civilian Shura governing council.

In October 2018, UNICEF estimated that 45,000 people live at the camp.UNICEF demands aid access to Syrians trapped on Jordan border, Al-Araby, 10 October 2018 Other estimates are of 50,000Thousands of Syrian Refugees Face Starvation as Russia and Assad Try to Force U.S. Out, Reuters Oct 11, 2018 or even 70,000.In 15 Days, Healthcare Deterioration Leads to 14 Civilians’ Death in al-Rukban camp, Enab Baladi 10 October 2018 In October, relief workers and refugees said the Syrian army blockaded the roads and prevented aid from reaching the camp, in an attempt to force frightened refugees into reconciliation.Forgotten in Rukban Camp. Syrians negotiate Assad regime Orient News 30 September 2018 Western sources say it was part of a Russian backed effort to pressure US and rebel forces to leave their base at nearby al-Tanf, while a Russian military source blamed the United States as responsible for security in the area. UNICEF reported that two infants died in the camp in early October, and called for urgent action, and one local NGO reported 14 civilians had died from late September to 10 October.

In January 2019, eight children were reported to have died at the Rukban camp due to cold weather and inadequate medical care, with the total number of refugees at the camp estimated at 45,000, 80% women and children. Rukban received its first aid delivery in three months on 7 February 2019 with the United Nations and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent reaching the camp with 118 trucks packed with food supplies, basic medicines, education items and children's recreational kits. Aid workers had arrived on the night of 6 February after arduous negotiations with the Syrian government. The aid convoy was expected to spend a week distributing material to the camp's residents.Rukban camp in Syria receives first aid in three months

In April 2019, UNOCHA estimated that 36,000 people were still living in the camp, and that 7,000 had left ""in the last month or so.""
As of 23 May, 13,153 people in 16 groups have left Rukban and been transported to five shelters in Homs governorate; constituting more than a third of Rukban's population of nearly 42,000.

In July 2019 one estimate suggested the camp had dwindled to a population of 11,000. Aid workers, diplomats and residents say it was a result of a five-month Russian siege to block supplies.

As of March 2020 the area suffered in a food crisis and humanitarian disaster. The Syrian government continues to block almost all aid, with no more than four aid convoys over the prior two years. Residents stated they fear violence or forcible military conscription by the Syrian regime should they attempt to leave.

Fall of Assad and aftermath
In November 2024, Syrian opposition groups launched a series of offensives on various regime-held cities, capturing Aleppo, Hama, and many other towns. The news was met with widespread celebrations in the refugee camp, as residents hoped the offensive would finally allow them to return home. The Revolutionary Commando Army, a small rebel group headquartered in the Al-Tanf military base located next to the camp, eventually joined the offensives and moved towards Palmyra and Damascus. Following the fall of Damascus and disintegration of the Assad government, the regime-imposed blockade was lifted, and thousands of people living in the camp began returning to their homes in the rest of Syria.

While the lifting of the Assad-imposed siege has made movement far easier than before, returning to other parts of the country has nonetheless been slow for the refugees in the camp. This is mainly due to a lack of money for transportation over the long, treacherous desert landscape and, in most cases, due to the refugees' homes having been destroyed during the years-long civil war. According to the head of a local council in the camp, Bassam Abdullah Suleiman, approximately 3,000 people left the camp in the immediate aftermath of the fall of Assad, while 5,000 continue to live there, either waiting for transportation, for new housing opportunities, or for their original houses to be repaired.",2025-02-17,['Syrian refugee camps' 'Homs Governorate'],"['Syria' 'Jordan–Syria border' 'tripoint' 'Iraq' 'Rukban' 'Jordan'

358,52014,76461934,32508,What Happened to the Heart?,"What Happened to the Heart? is the fifth studio album by Norwegian singer-songwriter and record producer Aurora. It was released on 7 June 2024 through Decca, Glassnote and Petroleum Records. Written and recorded between Norway, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, Aurora worked with Ane Brun, Matias Tellez, Tom Rowlands, Chris Greatti, Dave Hamelin, and Magnus Skylstad on its production. Inspired by a letter co-written by indigenous activists, Aurora began working on the album during a world tour in support of her previous release, The Gods We Can Touch, and conceived it as a cathartic process. It is an indie pop and disco album with elements of techno and folk music.

The album has been supported by the release of five singles, ""Your Blood"", ""The Conflict of the Mind"", ""Some Type of Skin"", ""Starvation"", and ""The Flood"", as well as the promotional single ""To Be Alright"". To promote the album, Aurora will embark on a European and American headlining concert tour in 2024 and 2025. What Happened to the Heart? received acclaim from music critics, with praise towards its themes and sound. It debuted at number five in her native Norway, and also within the top ten in four other nations.

 Background and conception 
In April 2022, Aurora read a letter co-written by indigenous activists titled ""We Are the Earth"", which, according to the magazine The Line of Best Fit, ""changed her life"". The letter called for a revolution: a collective response to global warming. They described the planet as ""the heart that pulsates within us"", a statement that led Aurora to create the album's title and concept. She began writing the album while on tour for The Gods We Can Touch, her previous album released on 21 January 2022. In January 2023, Aurora confirmed that she was back in the recording studio working on new music, which she called ""so many babies"". What Happened to the Heart? was recorded and produced between Norway, Germany, London, and Los Angeles. On the album, Aurora worked with her close collaborator Magnus Skylstad, along with musicians Ane Brun, Matias Tellez, Tom Rowlands of The Chemical Brothers, Chris Greatti, and Dave Hamelin.

What Happened to the Heart? was announced via her social media accounts on 28 March 2024. She has dubbed the album as the most personal and cathartic project in her career. In a press release, she added: ""Though its precise function and anatomy were not clearly understood, the heart was believed to be the centre of the soul. Of intuition. Of emotion and intention. Until we decided these were qualifications of the mind. Emotion overpowered by logic. And with the world being so corrupted by money, power and selfishness you cannot help but ask yourself – what happened to the heart?"". Being interviewed by NME, the singer said that the title of the album is ""the most important, beautiful and sad question I've ever wondered in my life"".

 Composition 
What Happened to the Heart? is an indie pop and disco album, that includes inspirations from pop, techno, and folk music. Containing 16 tracks, the album differs from the sound of the singles, as stated by Aurora before the album's release. Its overall lyrics talk about the constant loss of spiritual connection in modern life, and question the lack of humanity in the society. It also touches on other themes such as climate change, capitalism, and personal problems.

The opening track, ""Echo of My Shadow"", begins the album similarly to a prayer, where Aurora ""sings life and hope back into the world"". It is led by subdued vocals and strings. ""To Be Alright"", the second track, was compared by DIY Otis Robinson to the works of English singer Kate Bush. It is a disco-pop track with a 1990s dance tempo, in which she switches between soprano and a soft baritone. The third track, ""Your Blood"", is an ""antithetical happy-go-lucky"" indie pop song with electric guitars and melodies reminiscent of the Swedish rock band the Cardigans. The track showcases Aurora's vocal range, also switching between pitches. On ""The Conflict of the Mind"", Aurora pleads with a lover to open up. The folkloric ""Some Type of Skin"" is primarily a synth-pop, alternative pop, and Europop song, with elements of electropop. ""The Dark Dresses Lightly"" is a look after a break-up fueled with anguish, rage and resentment. ""My Name"" features Norwegian songwriter Ane Brun, and contains tiredness of ""unhealed trauma and collective ignorance to environmental overconsumption"". The folk-infused ""Do You Feel?"" is followed by ""Starvation"", which incorporates disco and 1980s synth-pop, with elements of electronica music and psychedelic beats; in the song, she confronts human arrogance and avoidance.

 Promotion 
 Singles 
What Happened to the Heart? was preceded by the release of three singles. The song ""Your Blood"" was released on 8 November 2023 as the lead single from the album. It marked her first solo musical material since The Gods We Can Touch in 2022. The second single, titled ""The Conflict of the Mind"", was released on 18 January 2024 alongside its music video. ""Some Type of Skin"" was released as the third single from the record on 20 March 2024. She performed it for the first time during an intimate show at London's Lafayette. The first promotional single, ""To Be Alright"", was released digitally on 31 May. ""Starvation"" was sent to radio airplay alongside the album as its fourth single. The music videos for ""Your Blood"", ""The Conflict of the Mind"", ""Some Type of Skin"", and ""Starvation"" were co-directed by Kaveh Nabatian and Aurora.

On 4 April 2025, Aurora released ""The Flood"" as the fifth single and the deluxe single from her album. She described the song as follows: ""This is a song about the invisible enemy — what brings you anger, what causes worry and sadness, what makes you retreat into yourself instead of facing the world fully. It's about the search for someone or something to blame, even when you know deep down that the only solution lies within yourself.""

 Tour 

To promote What Happened to the Heart?, Aurora embarked on her sixth concert tour, titled What Happened to the Earth?, between 2024 and 2025. It was announced alongside the album on 28 March 2024. The tour started on 26 June 2024, at the National Stadium in Dublin, and will conclude on 9 July 2025, at the Vieilles Charrues Festival in Carhaix.

 Critical reception 

Upon its release, What Happened to the Heart? was met with critical acclaim. 

Lauren Shirreff from The Telegraph wrote that ""reckoning with self-destructive feelings of fear, dissociation, and anger, the album is a journey to personal healing"", and highlighted the last track, ""Invisible Wounds"", as a standout."" NME critic Andrew Trendell opined that the album is an ""epic career-high, throwing up shapes along with reasons to live and to love"". For Hot Press, Caroline Kelly wrote that it represents Aurora's ""definitive attempt to craft an ecosystem around her work"", and described it as ""an offering of rhetorical questions and resounding affirmations, with a sweeping sonic palette"".

While praising ""Earthly Delights"" and ""When the Dark Dresses Lightly"", Stereoboard Will Marshall wrote that What Happened to the Heart? offers ""another slate of intense musical arrangements, theatrical vocals and radio-ready hits with her own unique twist"". Otis Robinson of DIY ended his review by saying: ""Monolithic in nature, the world-building on What Happened to the Heart? makes a bleeding heart – both for self and the earth – appear rapturous and unfathomably healing"".

 Accolades 
What Happened to the Heart? is nominated at the Spellemannprisen 2024 for Release of the Year and Alternative Pop. It marks Aurora's first nomination for the former since All My Demons Greeting Me as a Friend in 2017, when it was presented as Album of the Year.

 Commercial performance 
The album debuted at number five on the Norwegian VG-lista Topp 40 Album with first-week sales of 4,000 units, earning her fourth top five album.

In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number eight on the UK Albums Chart with 6,100 album-equivalent units, earning her second top ten and being her biggest opening week in the region surpassing her fourth studio album, The Gods We Can Touch.

359,51852,76459550,54574,Tatra marmot,"The Tatra marmot (Marmota marmota latirostris) is an endemic subspecies of marmot found in the Tatra Mountains. In the past, it was a game animal, but in the 19th century, its population drastically declined. It is a herbivore active in the summer, living in territorial family clans in the mountains from the upper montane to the alpine zone. It is one of the rarest vertebrates in Poland and is subject to strict legal protection. It is also legally protected in Slovakia. The  and the  classify the Tatra marmot as a strongly endangered subspecies (EN), while the Red List for the Carpathians in Poland designates it as ""CR"" – critically endangered. It is a relatively poorly researched animal.

 History of discovery and research 

The wider recognition of the marmot in Poland was influenced by the slow progress of settlement in the Tatra region, dating back to the privilege granted by Bolesław V the Chaste in 1255 to the Cistercian Abbey of Szczyrzyc: We also grant to the abbot: free hunting, all in the surrounding forests up to the mountains called Tatras. Historical accounts mention that over time, a group of hunters specializing in marmot hunting emerged, known as ""whistlers"".

Descriptions of Tatra marmots were very modest and mostly related to their hunting value. Hungarian pastor  wrote in 1774: The Carpathian marmot resides in the highest mountain peaks' dens in summer and winter. It feeds on roots and herbs and has fat, tasty meat. The meat, skins, and especially the fat, which had wide applications in folk medicine, were valued.

Various authors wrote about marmots; in 1719, teacher , in 1721, Polish naturalist and Jesuit Gabriel Rzączyński, in 1750, Gdańsk naturalist Jacob Theodor Klein, and in 1779, Polish naturalist and clergyman Jan Krzysztof Kluk mentioned ""whistlers"" in the Carpathians. Marmots were hunted almost without restrictions until around 1868, and on the Hungarian side of the Tatras until 1883 when regulations protecting this species were introduced.

In 1865, the first description of marmot biology was published. The author of the work About the Marmot was Maksymilian Nowicki – co-founder of the , researcher of Tatra fauna and flora, and a pioneer of nature conservation in Poland. Nowicki, using the name Arctomys ( – bear, and  – mouse, rat) as the generic name for marmots, used the term ""little bear mouse,"" while Ludwik Zejszner, writing at the same time, used the term ""bear mouse"": this peculiar little animal looks like it consists of two others; with a head similar to a mouse, and the rest of the body like a bear, covered with long hair similar to martens. Highlanders call it a marmot because of its special barking, as the individual barking sounds are so drawn out that they bear a great resemblance to whistling... The marmot makes very long burrows in the Tatra hollows, lining them with moss, grass, and, like many animals, undergoes hibernation. At the end of summer, it stores numerous root supplies in its burrows and, having fattened up excessively, falls asleep in this winter abode, only waking up completely emaciated with spring.

 Systematics and evolution 
Belonging to the family Sciuridae, the species Marmota marmota began to inhabit European territories already in the Pleistocene. It occurred over a vast area – from present-day Belgium and the shores of the English Channel to the Pannonian Basin. In the Holocene, with the warming climate, marmots had to choose more favorable locations. The moderate warmth of forested areas was not suitable for them, as their bodies are not well adapted to higher temperatures. They found cooler habitats in the elevated mountain ranges of Europe. Over time, they had to narrow their territories to the Alpine range and the Tatra Mountains. The separation of the Alpine population from the Carpathian one could have occurred from 15 to 50 thousand years ago, but for many years, no differences were noticed between the marmot living in the Tatras and its Alpine cousin, and both populations were treated as geographically separated locations of the same species.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Czechoslovak scientists undertook comparative studies. For this purpose, on 31 May 1961, a marmot was shot from a colony in . The holotype studies were conducted by , a zoologist from the agricultural university in Brno, who found significant differences in the structure of the nasal bones compared to representatives of Alpine populations. After conducting additional comparisons of the results of cranial measurements of the skulls of 10 Tatra marmots (selected from 16 obtained for study) and 40 marmots from the Alps (27 skulls were personally examined, and the measurement data of 13 were the result of Gerrit Miller's work from 1912), Kratochvíl concluded that there was a regularity in the comparative group, namely, that the anterior, facial part of the nasal bone was significantly wider and longer in Tatra marmots than in animals from the Alps. Additionally, he found that marmots living in the Tatras are smaller than their cousins and have slightly different fur coloration. Ultimately, Kratochvíl classified marmots from the Tatras as a separate subspecies, M. marmota latirostris, while marmots from the Alpine population were designated as M. marmota marmota. Some zoologists question whether the observed differences could be merely manifestations of individual variability within the small population. However, genetic studies have not yet been conducted to settle this matter.

 Etymology 
The generic name Marmota may derive from Gallo-Romance languages, meaning ""murmuring"" or ""purring"", or from Latin, being associated with the term mus montanus, which translates to ""mountain mouse"". The subspecies epithet latirostris originates from two Latin words: the element lati– comes from Latin lātus, meaning ""wide"", and –rostris from Latin rōstrum, referring to the nose or beak, and together it can be translated as ""broad-nosed"". The epithet refers to the flattened and wider facial part of the nasal bone (os nasale) of the animal compared to representatives of the Alpine population.

 Morphology 
The Tatra marmot is one of the largest rodents in Europe. It is similar in size to a domestic cat, with a massive torso. Its length, including the head, ranges from 45 cm to 65 cm (although another source by the same author provides a range of 40–60 cm). In spring, the body mass of adult males ranges from 2.7 to 3.4 kg, while females weigh between 2.5 and 3.0 kg. During the season from spring to autumn, marmots start to consume more calories, taking in more carbohydrates from grass seeds, and their brown adipose tissue significantly expands, creating an energy reserve for the next hibernation period. Consequently, the body mass of marmots begins to increase noticeably during this period and can reach over 6 kg by autumn, with over 2 kg attributed to fat tissue. The fluffy tail measures between 13 and 17 cm.

The primary fur consists of long, strong, and thick guard hairs, with the down hair being dense, composed of shorter, woolly, and slightly twisted hairs. The fur color is described as reddish-brown transitioning to dark brown-black. The hair coloration is highly varied, with black or dark brown dominating at the base, while shades of fawn, black, or reddish prevail higher up, fading to fawn or beige at the ends. The fur on the abdomen is lighter, ranging from light beige to yellowish. The head is covered with shorter hair, usually dark, black, or gray, with a light patch between the eyes. The muzzle is lighter, with a grayish tone, while the tail is blackish-brown, with a black tip. The fur of young individuals under 1 year old is notably darker and fluffier. Moulting typically occurs once a year, around June. Females, weakened by nursing new offspring, may have incomplete fur, and moulting may be delayed by about four weeks. As they age, the fur becomes more twisted and bushy. Older marmots, especially after hibernation, may have areas of thinning fur on their backs and tails.

Five rows of whiskers, measuring up to 8 cm in length, grow on the sides of the marmot's muzzle, with sensory hairs also distributed on the eyebrows. Marmots do not have sweat glands. The forehead is flat and wide, with short (2–2.5 cm), densely furred ears almost entirely concealed in the head's fur. The eyes are small and black. The front paws are short, robust, and dexterous, equipped with four hairy toes ending in claws measuring from 2 to 2.5 cm, which serve as useful tools for digging burrows and holding food. The muscular hind limbs end in five toes with sharp claws.

The external surface of the incisors is covered with hard enamel with longitudinal grooves, whose color changes with the animal's age, starting white in juveniles and darkening to orange and nearly brown with age. The posterior, concave surface of the incisors is made up of brittle dentin. The incisor's occlusal arrangement is scissor-like. The dentition for marmots is: .

In females, there are five pairs of mammary glands.

 Morphological in comparison to the alpine marmot 
The main feature that allowed the Tatra subspecies of marmot to be distinguished was the dimensions of the facial part of the nasal bone:

 Craniological comparisons (, 1961) 

Furthermore, Tatra marmots are characterized by lighter fur and have a grayish-brown coloration, while the alpine subspecies has a darker brown coloration, often with a reddish hue. M. marmota latirostris has a smaller body mass. However, sources do not provide details of this difference.

Despite differences in the habitats of both subspecies (alpine marmots occupy locations at altitudes up to 3200 m above sea level), no differences have been observed in behavior and way of life.

 Lifestyle 
The Tatra marmot is a diurnal animal with territorial and social behavior. It is monogamous, and individual families join colonies, with the nucleus typically being a dominant pair of animals.

 Annual life cycle 
The annual life cycle of the marmot consists of two periods: summer activity and hibernation.

 Summer activity 

The summer activity of the marmot begins around April and May and lasts until the second half of September or the first half of October. The earliest emergence of marmots on the surface has been observed on April 22, while the latest on May 10. This period lasts 139–158 days (or 139–161), with an average of 148 (or 150.7).

The first spring activity after awakening from winter hibernation is associated with the mating season. the estrous cycle typically occurs in the second decade of May. Mating takes place both inside and outside the burrow. Gestation lasts about 33 days, and the young are born in the second decade of June. Usually, from 1 to 6 offspring are born, most commonly from 2 to 3. They remain under the care of the female in the burrow until the second half of July. They start consuming solid food at the age of 8 weeks. They will only become independent after 3–4 years when they reach sexual maturity.

The beginning of summer activity is also marked by the search for new locations. Marmots migrate up to a distance of 3000 meters.

During the summer period, marmots spend their time foraging (43.9%) and patrolling the territory (40.3%). Other activities such as moving, gathering winter supplies, digging and tidying burrows, playing, hygiene, typically account for only 8.9% of their time. Spending time inside the burrow during the day constitutes an average of 6.9%.

There are three different types of contacts between marmots. The locomotor contact is the most common, followed by acoustic and visual contact.

 Hibernation 
At the end of September and beginning of October, the period of summer activity ends for the Tatra marmot, and the hibernation period begins. Changes in the environment signal the marmot's organism. The air temperature drops, the days become shorter, and the vegetation, which serves as food, becomes scarce. Marmots curl up into a ball and collectively arrange themselves at the bottom of the winter burrow chamber. Metabolic processes slow down, allowing the body temperature to decrease from 37.7 °C to 8–10 °C, which is about 2–3 °C lower than the temperature inside the burrow. In exceptional situations, the body temperature may drop to 3–5 °C. Respiratory rate decreases from 16 to as low as 2–3 (or 4–5) breaths per minute, as oxygen consumption during hibernation decreases by about thirty times, and the heart rate decreases from 220 to 30 contractions per minute. Other sources specify the frequency of heart ventricular contractions in the summer period as 130, decreasing during hibernation to 15 per minute.

Young marmots usually hibernate in the middle of the family, enveloped by older individuals, which helps them survive the burden of winter sleep more easily. Adult marmots accumulate more fat for this period. They also maintain a slightly higher body temperature.

During hibernation, the marmot wakes up approximately every 3 weeks. The awakening lasts for about 12–30 hours, after which the animal returns to sleep. The trigger for awakening may be a decrease in the temperature inside the burrow to 0 °C. Too many awakenings during hibernation are very energetically costly for the marmot's organism. During these short awakenings, the marmot's body temperature rises to about 34 °C, sharply increasing energy expenditure, and up to 90% of the reserves accumulated in the form of brown adipose tissue are consumed. In the case of prolonged winter, the organism may become excessively depleted, leading to the death of the animal. During hibernation, the marmot's body mass significantly decreases. Hibernation lasts for 201–227 days, 215 on average.

 Social structure 

Family colony can consist of several individuals – the dominant pair, their offspring from different years, and adopted individuals. According to former director of Tatra National Park, , several marmot families can comprise a colony. Marmot territorialism manifests in the daily need for the dominant male to patrol the boundaries demonstratively, systematically marking the territory with its scent. This is most likely done through secretions from glands located in the anal region, cheek glands, and glands in the paw pads. The marked territory is defended by the male against individuals from neighboring colonies. The first warnings are visual signals. The male raises its fur and waves its tail vertically. If the warning is not enough, it leads to a fight, where decisive wounds are inflicted using incisors. If the fight is evenly matched and neither male surrenders or flees, the brawl can last even the whole day. Aggressive defense is mainly directed towards foreign adult males. Young individuals can visit even the center of a foreign colony without fear. They are seen as adoption candidates for the colony without posing a threat to the dominant male's position.

The social nature of marmot colonies is evident in their collective actions. They build burrows together, sleep together, and help each other groom. Young ones play together in groups, wrestling, standing in a ""pillar"" position, or chasing each other around the colony area. During a meeting, marmots greet each other by touching noses and sniffing. Sometimes, they also show excitement by moving their tails up and down. Reproduction is also subject to specific rules and is reserved only for the dominant pair. Mature individuals in the colony must adhere to the leader in this regard. Periodic battles for leadership may result in the overthrow of the dominant male. He is then expelled from the colony, and the victor may sometimes kill his offspring to solidify his power.

 Sounds 

Marmots also communicate with each other using whistles or rather screams, as the sound emanates from their wide-open mouths. Its primary function is to warn colony members of danger. Several different levels of alarm whistles can be distinguished. The presence of a human, dog, or fox is signaled by a series of moderately intense whistles – then marmots swiftly move to the nearest burrow and observe from its entrance how events unfold. The series of whistles usually also discourages a fox, who is aware that after hearing the alarm signals, no marmot will become its prey. The greatest threat, such as the appearance of an eagle, is signaled by a single sharp whistle. Then, marmots flee without hesitation and hide in their burrows.

Marmots also emit other sounds, which can be described as squeaks or murmurs. These do not convey warning information.

 Geographical distribution 
The range of the Marmota marmota species spans between 44° and 49° N. Natural populations have survived in two mountain ranges: the Alps and the Tatra Mountains. The Tatra Mountains represent the northern range of the species (49° 14"" N). The Alps are inhabited by the subspecies Marmota marmota marmota, while Marmota marmota latirostris is an endemic species living in Poland and Slovakia. The vertical distribution range of Tatra marmots' habitats ranges from 1380 to 2050 meters above sea level, or according to other sources: in the Polish Tatra Mountains from 1750 to 1950 meters above sea level (with an average of 1870 meters above sea level), and in the entire Tatras massif from 1380 to 2330 meters above sea level.

In the main Tatra range, 207 main burrows were inventoried, and in the Low Tatras, 46 burrows were counted, or according to other sources, 40 burrows. The population of Tatra marmots on the Polish side of the Tatras was estimated at 150–200 individuals, while the total population in the entire Tatras is less than 1000 individuals.

The issue of precisely determining the locations of M. marmota latirostris in the Tatra Mountains encounters certain difficulties. While it is easy to establish that the autochthonous subspecies of the Tatra marmot occurs in the Western and Eastern Tatras, the origin of the marmots occurring in the Slovakian Low Tatras (with the highest peak being Ďumbier) separated from the main massif of the Tatras by the  is not clear. Although Ludwik Zejszner claimed that marmots were already living in the area of Solisko and Ďumbier in 1845, some researchers believe that the population in the Low Tatras is introduced from other parts of the Tatras. The fact of the 19th-century introduction in the area of Kráľova hoľa in the eastern part of the Low Tatras is reported by many researchers. Some even specify a specific time frame for it, around 1859–1867. Others believe that the marmots from the western part of the Low Tatras constitute a post-glacial population because, in their opinion, marmots would not be able to penetrate through the forested areas of the central part of the Low Tatras from previous introductions. In 1961, an expert on Tatra fauna, zoologist from the research station of the national park, Milič Blahout, wrote directly about the introduction of marmots from the Austrian Alps released in the Low Tatras between 1859 and 1867. Barbara Chovancová, who leads the marmot and chamois protection program in the Slovak Tatra National Park (TANAP), has no doubts that introductions were carried out twice in the Ďumbier area of the Low Tatras. Alpine marmots were released there in 1859, and in 1867, two pairs of marmots from the High Tatras were also released. If this were indeed the case, hybridization between representatives of both marmot subspecies could have occurred. Slovak authors mention a possible gene exchange between populations from the western and eastern parts of the Low Tatras. However, most believe that only Marmota marmota latirostris inhabits the Low Tatras. Kratochvíl proposed a hypothesis regarding the potential historical introduction confusion. He pointed out that historical information about marmots in the Carpathians could refer to populations still living in the 19th century in the Carpathians in Romania and Ukrainian Zakarpattia. However, there is a lack of reliable cranial or genetic studies that would resolve the issue of the origin of the populations in the Slovak Low Tatras.

Data about historical locations of marmots in the Tatra Mountains was derived from extensive local nomenclature referring to marmot habitats: Svišťový štít, Svišťová dolina, Svišťovský potok, Świstówka Roztocka, Świstówka Waksmundzka, Malá Svišťovka, Veľká Svišťovka, Svišťové sedlo, Świstowa Grań with Svišťové veže included, Świstowa Rówień, Svišťové plieska, Svišťový roh, Svišťová kôpka, Svišťový priechod, Svišťový chrbát, Sedlo pod Svišťovkou, Svišťovka, Nižná svišťová jaskyňa, Vyšná svišťová jaskyňa. These names appear in literature only in the 17th century, but Gabriel Rzączyński already in 1721 mentioned, ""is found in the Alps and Carpathian mountains in a valley named Świszcza"" (probably referring to Svišťová dolina).

In the last decade, a small number of marmots from the population in the Slovak Tatras were introduced into the Ukrainian part of the Eastern Carpathians.

 Fossil traces of occurrence 
Fossil traces of marmot occurrence have been found in Moravia, and in Poland in the vicinity of Jasło.

 Ecology 

The Tatra marmot is a herbivore. The main components of its diet include: herbaceous vegetation, shrubs and prostrate shrubs, roots, and tubers. The composition of its diet changes with the periods of vegetation in the Tatra Mountains. Favorite spring dishes include grasses, and in summer, the marmot most willingly eats spotted gentian, Luzula alpinopilosa, alpine coltsfoot, alpine avens, Mutellina purpurea, and Poa granitica. More than 40 species of consumed plants are mentioned; among them are alpine bartsia, wood cranesbill, Oreochloa disticha, European blueberry, Veratrum lobelianum, Campanula alpina, , Ranunculus pseudomontanus, large white buttercup, alpine hawkweed, brown clover, colorful fescue, Valeriana sambucifolia, Valeriana tripteris, Thymus alpestris, Thymus pulcherrimus, Adenostyles alliariae, dandelions, Solidago alpestris, Doronicum austriacum, Doronicum clusii, golden cinquefoil, , bistort, alpine bistort, golden root, alpine pasqueflower, alpine sainfoin, Juncus trifidus, Rumex alpestris, wavy hair-grass, eyebright, Soldanella carpatica, alpine meadow-grass, narcissus anemone and round-headed rampion. An adult marmot consumes about 1.5 kg of food daily. Water requirements are met by consuming juicy plants.

The Tatra marmot is vulnerable to attacks from predators such as the golden eagle, gray wolf, Eurasian lynx, and red fox. The mere presence of humans also causes pressure and changes in behavior. In relation to humans, the marmot maintains a safe escape distance of several dozen to several hundred meters. In relation to predators, this distance is significantly extended and can be several hundred meters.

 Habitat 

The entire population of the Tatra marmot is located within the territory of the Slovak Tatra National Park (TANAP) and the Polish Tatra National Park, so the habitat has a primitive character.

The typical habitat of M. marmota latirostris consists of Tatran areas in the altitudinal zonation: alpine zone, subalpine zone (grassy fragments), mountain zone (open spaces), and to a limited extent, foothill zone, with an average annual temperature ranging from -3 to +3 °C. The marmot prefers sunny places. The slope angle of the mountain habitats does not exceed 40°. The marmot enjoys the surroundings of rocks, which provide a good observation point and can also serve as shelter for hiding. The soil must have sufficient thickness to allow the digging of a burrow.

In the Tatras, the upper limit of vertical distribution of habitats is determined by orographic conditions. Above 2300 m above sea level, the low thickness of the soil basically prevents the digging of burrows. The lowest recorded site was inventoried at an altitude of 1350 m above sea level.

The central part of the colony typically occupies an area of about 2.5 hectares. The surface area of the territory depends, of course, on the vegetation coverage and the size of the colony. However, most authors report much smaller surface areas occupied by the colony: Peter Bopp 2000–2500 m2, Josef Kratochvíl 7900 m2, Milíč Blahout 2500–3600 m2, Dymitr I. Bibikov 500–4500 m2. The maximum occupied area can reach 2–7 hectares.

 Burrow 

The burrow is the most important habitat for the marmot. It spends the entire period of hibernation in it, and during the summer, the burrow provides shelter. Therefore, suitable soil conditions, which allow easy excavation of tunnels, largely determine the location of a given colony. Both the thickness of the soil and the arrangement of aquifers are important, as they influence the avoidance of flooding or inundation. The nesting chamber is lined with dried grasses from the local vegetation. The marmot utilizes Juncus trifidus, Oreochloa disticha, fescue, reed grass, moss and lichens. The gathered lining is not used by marmots as food. It has also been observed that marmots collect tissues or fabrics discarded by tourists for this purpose. Marmots maintain cleanliness of their burrows, so each burrow is equipped with a latrine, which is created in alcoves along the side tunnels. Only there does the marmot relieve itself. Similarly, local marmot latrines can also be found outside formal burrows. They are created temporarily on the family's territory, in short tunnels, or in depressions under rocks.

 Hibernation burrow 

The hibernation burrow plays a crucial role in the life of these animals. A marmot family spends an average of 215 days per year in it, hence the term ""main burrow"". It can also serve as the center of a marmot's life. The winter burrow consists of an entire system of branching tunnels, which can have a total length of over 10 meters. The tunnels have an oval shape with a diameter of 15–18 cm and are relatively shallow, but below the frost line – typically 1.2 meters below ground level. The central chamber of the burrow is located even up to 7 meters deep, accessed by several tunnels allowing the use of distant entrances. The chamber is abundantly lined with hay collected by the animals. To prepare one bedroom for winter, these rodents can use up to 15 kg of grass. Near the entrances, there is usually an earth mound formed by the removal of material during tunneling. The tunnels are equipped with small widenings, which allow family members to pass each other going in opposite directions. Before winter, the entrances to the burrows are carefully sealed by the marmots from the inside with packed earth, stones, and feces.

Each burrow houses a family hibernating, usually consisting of 4 to 10 marmots. In the past, accounts from hunters indicated that they found between 2 and 15 individuals dug out from a winter burrow.

 Summer burrow 
The summer burrow, sometimes referred to as transitional, is a system of tunnels built for temporary use during the summer season. It is excavated more shallowly (does not need to protect from the cold of frozen ground) and has a shorter tunnel system. Sometimes, after summer, it may be deepened and used for hibernation. However, if a family uses the hibernation burrow in the summer, they do not build a separate summer burrow.

 Escape burrow 
The most commonly encountered underground structure of the marmot is the escape burrow, also known as emergency or rescue burrow. These are makeshift shelters from predators. Their construction is very simple – sometimes their length does not exceed 1 meter, and they are equipped with only one or two entrances and do not have many branches. The marmot tries to cover its territory with a network of such makeshift shelters. Within the area of one colony, there can be found from 16 to 20 such hiding places, and when disturbed, the animal can remain underground for several hours. The marmot tries not to stray more than 10–15 meters from the nearest shelter. Over time, even escape burrows can be expanded and elevated to a higher status.

 Tatra marmot in captivity 
Tatra marmots are not currently bred in Polish zoos. Between 1924 and 1935, the zoo in Poznań possessed three individuals from the Polish population of M. marmota, while from 1927 onwards, the Kraków Bażantarnia (which was succeeded by the local zoo) bred four Tatra marmots. After World War II, individual specimens of this subspecies were exhibited in Czechoslovakian zoos.

 Threats 

Until the 19th century, regular hunting of marmots was conducted in the Tatra Mountains, where their skins, meat, and fat were highly sought-after commodities. There was a particularly high demand for marmot fat due to its use in traditional medicine and the widespread belief in its miraculous healing properties. Marmot fat was used both externally and internally for various purposes, including the treatment of hernias. It was also given with milk to women in labor to facilitate childbirth and as a strengthener. Additionally, it was believed to heal wounds, treat swollen glands (lymph nodes), and alleviate coughs. Towards the end of the 19th century, when Zakopane gained status of a spa town, many tuberculosis patients sought ""miraculous remedies"" in the form of marmot fat.

Marmot skins were used to cover horse collars or sold as fur to urban residents. However, the highlanders in the Podhale region did not use them to make their own clothing. Freshly removed marmot skins were applied to painful areas for rheumatism. Marmot meat was also considered the best among all game meats.

In the second half of the 19th century, only refuges inaccessible to hunters remained. In 1881, only 30 individuals were inventoried on the Polish side of the Tatras, and by 1888, there were 35 individuals left.

On 5 October 1868, under pressure from members of the local history commission of the  (Maksymilian Nowicki, Ludwik Zejszner, and Father Dr. ), the Diet of Galicia and Lodomeria in Lviv adopted a law regarding the prohibition of capturing, exterminating, and selling alpine animals proper to the Tatras, marmots, and wild goats. This was the world's first case of parliamentary enactment of a law protecting animal species. The situation of the Tatra marmot worsened again during World War I, leading to an increase in hunting. Since then, sheep grazing in marmot habitats has also begun. A significant improvement in the situation came with the establishment of the Tatra National Park in 1954, which encompasses all marmot locations in the Polish Tatras.

The main threats to M. marmota latirostris include pressure from predators and hunting. Changes in behavior are induced by excessive tourist and sports activity. Human presence also limits contacts between colonies (e.g., in the Kasprowy Wierch area), which are necessary for genetic exchange, and increases the risk of additional diseases, including parasites.

 Population 
Since the significant decline of marmots in the 19th century, their population has slowly been increasing. In 1881, there were 30 marmots in the Polish Tatras, between 1888 – 35, in 1928 and 1952 – 50, in 1982 between 108 and 132, and around 190 individuals in 2003. Altogether, on both sides of the Tatras at the beginning of the 21st century, there were approximately 700–800 individuals of this subspecies.",2024-12-06,"['Marmots' 'Tatra Mountains' 'Rodents of Europe' 'Herbivorous animals'

360,30044,75824560,12729,Noboribetsu Marine Park Nixe,"Noboribetsu Marine Park Nixe (登別マリンパークニクス, Noboribetsu marinpāku nikusu) is a Japanese public aquarium located in Noboribetsu, Hokkaido, Japan. It is the one of largest aquariums in Hokkaido, with several buildings constructed around a Western-style castle building.“全道一の水族館目指す登別の「道マリンパーク」”. 北海道新聞 (北海道新聞社). (1987年1月31日) It is a member of the Japanese Association of Zoos and Aquariums (JAZA) and the aquarium is accredited as a Museum-equivalent facility by the Museum Act from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.

History

To establish the largest aquarium in Hokkaido, the city government of Noboribetsu established a third-sector company as the main operator with investment from 42 local companies. The aquarium was opened on July 20, 1990, at a total project cost of approximately 7.3 billion yen.

In the first month of its opening, approximately 230,000 people visited the museum.“登別マリンパークオープン”. 北海道新聞 (北海道新聞社). (1990年7月20日) For the first two years of its opening, it attracted more than 600,000 visitors per year.鞠子理人(2012年7月21日). “登別マリンパークの経営順調、累積赤字10分の1に削減”. 室蘭民報 (室蘭民報社)

However, from the third year of operation onwards, the number of visitors rapidly dropped due to the economic downturn caused by the bursting of the bubble economy and the loss of popularity. As a result, in 1997, the private company withdrew, leaving Noboribetsu City virtually holding the entire operation.""Wave Motion"": ""Noboribetsu Marine Park Nixe"" Withdrawn by Private Sector City management skills questioned as attendance continues to decline and search for new owner"". Hokkaido Shimbun (Hokkaido Shimbun). (April 8, 1997)

As a result, ""Hokkaido Marine Park,"" the operating body of the park, fell into a business crisis with accumulated debts of approximately 4.03 billion yen as of January 2001, and on January 18, 2001, Noboribetsu City, Kamori Kanko, and Hokkaido Marine Park reached a basic agreement on ""management improvement measures"" and signed a memorandum of understanding. On January 18, 2001, Noboribetsu City, Kamori Kanko, and Hokkaido Marine Park signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to transfer management rights of the marine park to Kamori Kanko.""Noboribetsu City and Kamori Kanko hold press conference to present Hokkaido Marine Park's restructuring plan"". Muroran Minpo (Muroran Minpo). (January 24, 2001)

Under this restructuring plan, Kamori Kanko became the largest shareholder by transferring the 25% stake (100 million yen investment) owned by Noboribetsu City without compensation, and ""Hokkaido Marine Park"" became a private company from the third sector.

Then, Noboribetsu City acquired the park's building for approximately 800 million yen and leased it free of charge for 10 years, which effectively exempted Noboribetsu City from paying property tax, and ""Hokkaido Marine Park"" became free of property tax and building The ""Hokkaido Marine Park"" was no longer burdened with property taxes and building depreciation.

In addition, Shimizu Real Estate, an affiliate of Shimizu Corporation, which was the largest creditor out of the approximately 3.7 billion yen in interest-bearing debt it held at the time, was asked to transfer approximately 2.7 billion yen in debt to the city free of charge, and of the remaining 1 billion yen, approximately 800 million yen was transferred to the city. The remaining approximately 1 billion yen, about 800 million yen, was eliminated when Noboribetsu City purchased the park's buildings and most of the interest-bearing debt was effectively forgiven.

After the park became a subsidiary of Kamori Kanko, the number of visitors was estimated at 250,000 to 300,000 per year, and the number of employees was reduced to make the park profitable at that level. As of July 2012, the number of employees was reduced to 28 full-time employees and 50 part-time employees, or about one-fourth of the original staff, reducing costs.

In addition, the company improved the impression of the food by introducing homemade dishes prepared by chefs, and increased the number of foreign guests from overseas to about 34% of the total visitors, thereby expanding and stabilizing sales.

The synergistic effects of the exemption of interest-bearing debt, property taxes, and building depreciation, which Noboribetsu City had initiated, and the reduction of expenses and increase in sales, which Kamori Kanko had initiated, enabled the company to return to profitability in a single year from 2006 and to increase its cumulative operating income to ¥2.5 billion, up from ¥2.5 billion in reducing the accumulated deficit by one-tenth to about 0.5 billion yen.

In 2021, a joint research team at the Noboribetsu Marine Park Nixe, Azabu University and Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine elucidated pathological changes in individuals that lead to early detection of avian aspergillosis, a respiratory disease that penguins are particularly susceptible to and has been considered difficult to treat, and published their research results on diagnosis and treatment by CT scan in the Official Journal of the Japanese Society of Veterinary Science, an academic journal. This research received the 2021 Japanese Society of Wildlife Medicine Best Paper Award.

364,39622,76126229,25403,DeeDo,"DeeDo (, ) is a Thai fruit juice brand. It is the primary product of Foodstar (), a Nakhon Pathom-based company that also makes food and beverage products. It diversified beyond DeeDo fruit juices through its Mikku yogurt brand as well as by selling herbal teas, ice pops, and jelly. Foodstar's original products occupied the economy and super-economy segments of the fruit juice market. The company in 2021 released DeeDo Max C, a more premium product that contains double the amount of orange juice of the original product. Its products in 2023 could be purchased in 20 countries.

Along with seven friends and workers, Chantra Pongsri established Foodstar in 1993. They released the DeeDo brand in 1995 and broke even and began turning a profit four years later. To distinguish themselves from competitors entering the fruit juice market, Foodstar began creating television advertisements in 2006 and later used celebrity branding to promote its products. Foodstar partnered with the actor  in 2008, the actor Saranyu Winaipanit in 2013, the Burmese actor Aung Ye Lin in 2016, the singer Jannine Weigel in 2016, the actor Mario Maurer in 2017, the actress  in 2021, and the singers Ble Patumrach R-Siam and  in 2023.

History
Kitti Pongsri founded a company that sold instant noodles and wanted to diversify into other products. Noting that few Thai companies sold fruit juice, he decided it was the right product. His daughter, Chantra Pongsri, recruited seven friends and workers to found Foodstar in 1993. The founders came from a food and beverage background, having previously worked at the seasoning powder brand Fa Thai () and the instant noodle brand Wai Wai. The company began selling the fruit juice brand DeeDo to consumers in 1995. It took four years after DeeDo's launch for company to break-even and start turning a profit. International consumers initially became familiar with Foodstar's products through border trade, and the company in 2011 started exporting its goods. For instance, after two to three years of border trade with Myanmar, Foodstar partnered with the distributors MK Distribution and Honestly Business Enterprise to sell the products directly to customers.

After conducting a test on Foodstar's DeeDo juice in 2014, Myanmar's Ministry of Cooperatives discovered it had been tainted by coliform bacteria and mould. Farmers in 2015 said that a Foodstar factory in the  of Sam Phran district in Nakhon Pathom province had discharged wastewater, resulting in rancid smells and ruining their products. After four months of Foodstar's not resolving the problem, the farmers demonstrated at the factory. They obstructed the entrance and exit, held signs, shouted through loudspeakers, and used a bulldozer to barricade the road. Foodstar said that a construction firm it had contracted to enlarge the factory in April had pumped water into the canal after there had been a downpour but that the current polluted water did not originate from the factory.

Fruit juice made up ฿12.5billion (US$) of Thailand's economy in 2015, and the economy juice sector made up 40.3% of that. Taking 16.8% of the economy juice sector, Foodstar's DeeDo fruit juice brand ranked second behind the Minute Maid Pulpy owned by The Coca-Cola Company. Foodstar's revenue was ฿3billion (US$) in 2017 and between 35% and 40% of its revenue came from exports. Around 2018, the company upgraded its equipment to reduce manufacturing expenses. The new machinery could assemble 600 bottles per minute up from 200 per minute. After the COVID-19 pandemic began, the company experienced a drop in sales since customers experienced more financial challenges.

Foodstar has 15 distribution centers in Thailand in Chanthaburi province, Chiang Mai province, Chumphon province, Hat Yai district, Khon Kaen province, Nakhon Pathom province, Nakhon Ratchasima province, Nakhon Sawan province, Phitsanulok province, Prachuap Khiri Khan province, , Suphan Buri province, Surat Thani province, Ubon Ratchathani province, and Udon Thani province. The distribution centers each cost about ฿200million (US$) to build. The company has a  factory in the Sam Phran district of the Nakhon Pathom province. To upgrade the equipment at its factory, Foodstar spent between ฿200million (US$) and ฿300million (US$) in 2022. The purpose was to prepare the company for increased local and foreign sales of its products. The company's goods could be purchased in 20 countries in 2023 including China, India, the Philippines, and the United States. Foodstar that year had revenue of ฿800million (US$).

Products
Foodstar's products are economy and super-economy goods, meaning they operate in the lower-priced market. Foodstar's primary product is DeeDo, a brand of fruit juice that it produces and distributes. Aiming to attract new customers, it expanded the products it makes, also selling yoghurt drinks, ice pops, and jelly. Its yogurt brand is called Mikku and includes the flavors blueberry and orange. Targeting customers who were entering the job market, Foodstar in 2015 started selling herbal teas with the flavors chrysanthemum, roselle, and tamarind. The next year, they released the brand Fruitku, a fruit juice containing coconut gel. Foodstar in 2021 launched DeeDo Max C, a more premium beverage product. The drink had double the amount of orange juice as the original product and 200% vitamin C. It was sold in three citrus flavors: mandarin orange, yuzu, and calamansi. The company planned to add candy such as gummy candy to the products it sells.

A substantial portion of the people who consume Foodstar products are children and teenagers. Foodstar's leaders were worried that sales of the company's products would drop owing to teenagers' focus on fitness, Thailand's aging population, and sugary drink taxes. They planned to create new products to cater to consumers' desire for healthier food and beverage options.

Marketing
More beverage competitors started to enter the market roughly eight years after the Foodstar brand DeeDo began being sold in 1995. To distinguish itself from other brands, Foodstar started investing in television advertisements, posting its first in 2006. Its early ads aired on animated cartoon channels. Foodstar subsequently began celebrity branding campaigns, partnering with actors who performed on the most popular drama series. They hired the actor , who started endorsing their products in advertisements in 2008. During their 20th anniversary year in 2013, Foodstar invested more than ฿100million (US$) on marketing, hiring Saranyu Winaipanit to promote their products including in a commercial. Focusing their marketing on teenagers, the company sponsored DeeDo High School Band, a 13-week television show on Channel 3's . The program aired on Saturdays between May and August 2015 and allowed students in matthayom 1–6 to compete. The company invested ฿200million (US$) on marketing in 2016, spending ฿100million (US$) on creating a commercial with the singer Jannine Weigel with the theme ""because we belong together"". Aiming to attract teenagers who lived in cities, Foodstar modernized its products' packaging. The company changed the shape of its bottles from square to round. It secured a license to feature characters from the manga series Doraemon on its products.

In 2017, Foodstar spent ฿200million (US$) on creating a television advertisement starring the actor Mario Maurer. Aiming to promote its products in ASEAN countries, the company aired the Maurer commercial in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. The ad's theme was ""passing on freshness ... satisfaction anywhere, everywhere"". Foodstar partnered with the Burmese actor Aung Ye Lin to promote its products in Myanmar, where the company held a sweepstake containing prizes like the iPhone 6 and cash prizes. The actor Chanon Santinatornkul was recruited as brand sponsor in 2019, aiming to interest youth in their products. After launching the more premium drink DeeDo Max C, Foodstar hired the actress  to promote the product to youths.

For its 30th anniversary year, Foodstar allocated ฿200million (US$) to spend on marketing. Aiming to attract younger customers, the company spent some of the money in 2023 to redesign the packing and logo of Deedo and other offerings to look better and be more contemporary. Another portion of the funds was spent on a ""lucky draw"". Foodstar signed partnerships with the singers Ble Patumrach R-Siam and  to sponsor and advertise DeeDo.",2025-03-10,"['1993 establishments in Thailand'

365,13071,75347540,14041,1906–07 Milan FBCC season,"During the 1906–07 season Milan Foot-Ball and Cricket Club competed in the Italian Football Championship, the FGNI Tournament and the Palla Dapples.

 Summary 

In the 1906–07 season Milan won the third Italian Championship in their history, the second in a row. Added to this victory were the conquest of the Palla Dapples (seven times) and of the FGNI Tournament, two tournaments of comparable importance to that of the championship. This season, the squad showed a strong component of Swiss players: after the English athletes who were responsible for the conquest of the first scudetto in the history of Milan (1901), the large group of Swiss players was decisive for the club championship wins of 1906 and 1907. Among the others, Hans Walter Imhoff is to be remembered in this season as league top scorer for the club, with five goals. Milan won the title without defeats, a result that was extended to the other two aforementioned trophies.

Shortly before the start of the season, Herbert Kilpin, co-founder and first coach of Milan, left the role and was replaced by former player Daniele Angeloni, also a founding member of Milan. The Englishman remained in the squad and continued to be available as a player, resulting as one of the most decisive players of the season, scoring a total of seven goals (which might have been more due to the lack of sources for many goals).

373,30364,75836675,3858,Robotic tech vest,"Robotic tech vest (RTV) is a special wearable equipment protecting workers near industrial robots. It is similar to a high-visibility jacket but for robots. Robots can sense a vest from a distance and avoid moving into it, thus protecting the wearer from collisions.

History
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has studied the topic of workers' safety in the areas of operating robots and concluded: ""Studies indicate that many robot accidents occur during non-routine operating conditions, such as programming, maintenance, testing, setup, or adjustment. During many of these operations the worker may temporarily be within the robot's working envelope where unintended operations could result in injuries."" Before employing RTVs, workers marked out the area where they would be working to enable the robotic route planner to smartly route around that area.

Operation in warehouse
In 2018, Amazon introduced robotic tech vests in 25 warehouses to protect workers from robot collisions. This kind of equipment is needed in the warehouse, where human workers and robots cooperate. Additionally to the general obstacle detection of the robots, the RTV ensures that workers are detected as obstacles. It allows the robots to detect the human from farther away and update its trajectory. A robotic tech vest is a combo of a belt and suspenders. As according to Amazon in 2019, RTV has been introduced to more than 25 sites and more than 1 million activations were completed. The workers are safe with RTVs when they enter the area to fix a robotic system or retrieve fallen items. Amazon claimed RTVs to be successful in 2019.

Difference to collaborative robots
The technology of robotic tech vest stands in contrast to the collaborative robots approach. In case of collaborative robots, the RTVs are not needed.",2025-01-23,['Wearable devices' 'Warehouses' 'Industrial robotics' 'Amazon (company)'],"['industrial robot' 'high-visibility jacket'

Production
In June 2022, Scott Derrickson said that while Joe Hill was protective of his story, the author had pitched him a ""wonderful idea"" for a sequel that he was open to directing if the first film was a success. In August, Derrickson and Hill confirmed that there were discussions with the studio to make a sequel. Derrickson referred to the financial success of The Black Phone as one of the catalysts for the development of the project. Hill said his inspiration to writing a sequel was based on the ""iconic imagery"" of the Grabber's masks. 

In November 2023, it was reported that Ethan Hawke, Mason Thames, Madeleine McGraw, Jeremy Davies, and Miguel Cazarez Mora would reprise their roles from the first film. The script was written by Scott Derrickson and C. Robert Cargill, with the duo also serving as producers on the sequel. In December, Derrickson was confirmed to return as the director. In September 2024, Demián Bichir joined the cast. With the working title of Mysterium, principal photography began in Toronto on November 4, 2024, and was set to conclude on January 15, 2025.

382,36140,5351136,9041,Private school fee fixing scandal,"In September 2005, fifty prominent private schools in the United Kingdom were found guilty of operating a fee-fixing cartel by the Office of Fair Trading. The OFT found that the schools had exchanged details of their planned fee increases over three academic years 2001–02, 2002-03 and 2003–04, in breach of the Competition Act 1998.

The Independent Schools Council – a lobby group funded by the independent schools in question – said that the investigation had been ""a scandalous waste of public money"".

Evidence
Emails showed that the schools were routinely swapping information about their costs and intended fee changes, as often as four to six times a year as part of a Sevenoaks' Survey. The investigation was prompted by the September 2003 leak of emails to The Times by two Winchester College pupils. Sent by Bill Organ, Winchester College's bursar at the time, to the Warden of the college, they contained details of 20 schools' fees and the phrase: ""Confidential please, so we aren’t accused of being a cartel"".

Arguments in support of the schools
The Independent Schools Council felt that the action was disproportionate. It was argued that sharing information was common amongst charities (as the schools are classified) and that the aim was to keep fees as low as practicably possible. Until 2000, when the Competition Act 1998 displaced the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976, the practice was lawful, as the schools were exempt from the anti-cartel laws that applied to businesses.

Jean Scott, the head of the Independent Schools Council, said that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business, were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other, and that they were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted). She wrote to John Vickers, the OFT director-general, saying, ""They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer. They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed.""

Jonathan Shephard, Chief Executive of the ISC, stated: ""This is a Kafkaesque situation... the law seems to have changed without Parliament realising – and without the independent sector being consulted – contrary to the government's own strict guidelines on consultation. Schools are now being held liable for breaking a law which no-one knew applied to them"". He added: ""The OFT's broad assertion that sharing information produced higher fees is highly contentious.""

For Truro and Sedbergh Schools, the OFT's preliminary findings are that they took part in the Sevenoaks Survey in only two of the three years investigated.

Resolution
The OFT released a 500-page statement which was summed up thus:

However, on final publication this was changed to:

The response to the OFT investigation was co-ordinated by the Independent Schools Council's Chief Executive, Jonathan Shephard, with a negotiating team including Lord (Nicholas) Lyell, the former Attorney General; the solicitor and mediator Tony Willis, and the businessman Sir Bob Reid. One of the principal aims of the negotiation was to ensure that financial payments by the schools should go to a charitable trust rather than to the Treasury: this followed a United States example where a sportswear firm had agreed to provide sports facilities in settlement of a competition law claim. The ISC negotiating team wanted the charitable trust to benefit children from disadvantaged backgrounds, but OFT insisted on the fund benefiting pupils from the 50 schools at the relevant time.

All the schools involved were given fines of £10,000 each for their infringement, with a 50% reduction to £5,000 for Eton and Winchester for early co-operation. Additionally the schools agreed to pay £3 million into a trust fund aimed to benefit the pupils attending the schools during the period involved; it has been stressed that the trust fund is not a fine. The schools paid in equal instalments over five years, finishing in 2010, with an average cost of about £70,000 each. Broadly speaking, the payments were approximately 0.7% of the relevant turnover during the years of the infringement. The low percentage is largely down to the fact that the change to the law was not notified to schools. Additionally, the settlement was on the basis that all 50 schools accepted the settlement proposal.

The impact of the OFT's case on day and boarding fees set subsequently by the schools has been analysed. Research indicates that resolving the case had an insignificant impact on fees levels, though independent school fees may have increased faster during the OFT investigation due to fears of possible future regulation.",2025-03-16,"['Private schools in the United Kingdom' 'Cartels' '2005 in British law'

383,2091,75031433,10055,Steem (peanut butter),"Steem (often stylized STEEM) was a  brand of caffeinated peanut butter produced by STEEM Peanut Butter, Inc. The company was co-founded by Chris Pettazzoni, Keith Barnofski, and Andrew Brach and was based in Greenfield, Massachusetts. Sold in the United States between 2014 and 2019, the peanut butter was predominantly marketed as an alternative to coffee as a source of the stimulant caffeine. In 2015, US senator Chuck Schumer publicly criticized the high levels of caffeine in Steem, leading to the company being contacted by the Food and Drug Administration as part of a wider investigation into foods containing additional caffeine.

 History and product 
Steem was originally conceived as a potential hangover cure; the idea of adding caffeine to peanut butter occurred while the inventors were preparing various sandwiches containing the spread. Powdered, flavourless caffeine extracted from coffee beans was procured from a company in Virginia specializing in producing anhydrous caffeine for use in dietary supplements. Barnofski, who had experience as a sous-chef, began devising recipes for the new product, incorporating the caffeine by mixing it with the fat from the peanut butter. Production space was rented at a community center in Greenfield and Steem was launched in March 2014, around two years after its initial conception. The peanut butter retailed at $4.99 per jar and was sold online through the company's website, as well as in a small number of retailers and gymnasiums around New England. By January 2016, the price had risen to $6 per eight-ounce jar.

Steem was marketed primarily as a source of energy due to the added caffeine. Its creators claimed that the slower digestion time of peanut butter compared to other sources of caffeine meant that the stimulant was absorbed into the body over a longer period and at a lower concentration, thus offering a ""more mellow"" experience without the ""jitters, heart palpitations and stained teeth"" associated with coffee consumption. The spread was also promoted towards bodybuilders due to its high protein content, and the label on the jar highlighted the use of exclusively natural ingredients (peanuts, peanut oil, salt, agave nectar, and caffeine) in Steem's production.

In November 2015, US senator for New York, Chuck Schumer, called on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate Steem. He claimed that its high caffeine content could pose a danger to health, especially in children. A recommended two-tablespoon serving of Steem contained 150 milligrams of caffeine, as much as two cups of coffee or five cans of Coca-Cola. Schumer suggested the introduction of limits on additional caffeine and warning labels on products with caffeine added. The FDA subsequently sent a letter to the creators of Steem on December 15, 2015, requesting more information about the use of caffeine in the product. The letter was part of a wider investigation by the FDA into foods containing additional caffeine that could be marketed towards younger people. A message on the company's website warned that Steem was not suitable for pets such as dogs and cats.

As of October 2019, the company's website had been updated to state that Steem was no longer in production.",2023-11-01,"['Peanut butter brands' 'Products introduced in 2014'

385,37450,76062507,49365,Time Still Turns the Pages,"Time Still Turns the Pages () is a 2023 Hong Kong drama film directed by Nick Cheuk and produced by Derek Yee, with Cheuk also serving as the writer and co-editor, and marking his directorial debut as part of the First Feature Film Initiative. Starring Siuyea Lo and Ronald Cheng, the film explores themes of education in Hong Kong and follows a secondary school teacher (Lo) who confronts a childhood trauma caused by academic pressure from his father (Cheng) while helping a suicidal student.

Cheuk wrote the screenplay in response to student suicides in Hong Kong in 2015, drawing heavily on the real-life experience of a friend who took his own life and who was also a mutual friend of Siuyea Lo. The project was greenlit in 2019 as part of the First Feature Film Initiative, with rewrites occurring in 2020 and principal photography taking place in 2021, primarily at Chiu Yang Por Yen Primary School.

The film had its world premiere at the 25th Shanghai International Film Festival on 11 June 2023, followed by a theatrical release in Hong Kong on 16 November. It received five and twelve nominations in the 60th Golden Horse Awards and 42nd Hong Kong Film Awards, respectively, with Nick Cheuk winning Best New Director at both ceremonies.

 Plot 
The film opens with a child named Cheng Yau-kit, who aspires to become a teacher, sitting despairingly on the rooftop of a condo.

In modern times, a secondary school teacher named Cheng punishes a hearing-impaired student, Vincent, for pushing another student down the staircase. When Cheng attempts to counsel him, Vincent scoffs and tells Cheng to handle his own divorce issues first. Cheng then discovers a suicide note in the classroom rubbish bin. He reports it to the headmaster, but the vice principal advises him to ignore it to avoid affecting the students' preparation for the upcoming university entrance exams. In desperation, Cheng asks Ka-yee, the class monitor, to help identify students who may be contemplating suicide.

The film then transitions to a flashback: Cheng Yau-kit, the son of renowned barrister Cheng Chi-hung, is a well-educated but academically challenged schoolboy. His younger brother, Cheng Yau-chun, is a prodigy who excels in both academics and music. Yau-kit tries hard to improve his grades, even starting a diary to appease his father after hearing a respected educator advise Yau-chun that diary writing can aid language learning. Despite his efforts, Yau-kit's grades remain poor, frustrating his father, who blames Yau-kit for not working hard enough and for spending too much time reading manga, leading him to punish Yau-kit by throwing away his manga books. Despite their conflicts, Chi-hung promises Yau-kit a trip to Disneyland in California if he can rank in the top 15 in class, based on Yau-kit's mother Heidi's suggestion. However, Yau-kit's performance worsens, and he ranks second to last, forcing him to repeat the grade. Enraged, Yau-kit is severely beaten by his father, while Yau-chun quietly studies nearby.

To cheer up his brother, Yau-chun takes Yau-kit to buy toys and play on the rooftop, but they are caught and Heidi scolds Yau-kit only. When Yau-kit anticipates punishment from his father, he is surprised by Chi-hung's calm demeanor, as Chi-hung claims he has given up on Yau-kit and will no longer waste effort guiding him. Realising his family is going to California without him, Yau-kit tries to hug Yau-chun, who responds casually, saying he will bring souvenirs back. Believing his family would be happier without him, Yau-kit commits suicide. After receiving the news, the family is devastated. Chi-hung refuses to reveal the truth and pretends Yau-kit died from an illness, while he sinks into depression and guilt. Heidi, overwhelmed by grief, leaves the family. Yau-chun is traumatised and feels regretful for not reaching out to Yau-kit, focusing solely on appeasing his parents and teachers while looking down on Yau-kit due to the academically inclined environment he grew up in. This leads him to become rebellious and decide to fulfill Yau-kit's dream of becoming a teacher.

Back in the present, it is revealed that the teacher Cheng is actually Yau-chun, who has not communicated with his father for a long time, blaming him for his brother's death. He finally visits Chi-hung, who is now terminally ill. The two embrace, crying together as they express their shared guilt and regret over Yau-kit's death, which has haunted them for years. After Chi-hung passes away soon afterwards, Yau-chun writes down his story in Yau-kit's diary and gives it to his estranged wife, Sherry, explaining his panic upon learning of her pregnancy and hoping she can share their story through her radio drama program. On graduation day, Cheng leaves his phone number for his students and bids them farewell, ultimately receiving a text message from the student who wrote the suicide note, seeking counseling from him.

 Production 
 Development 
Director and writer Nick Cheuk originally penned the screenplay in 2015, based on the death of a close friend and university classmate. He later made revisions to the script, altering certain aspects of his friend's experiences to delve into the concerning phenomenon of student suicides in Hong Kong. He completed the first draft in 2019, initially titled Suicide Note. During the same year, he applied for and received funding from the Hong Kong Film Development Council's First Feature Film Initiative. He dedicated two years to rewriting and fine-tuning the script. In 2020, Derek Yee returned to Hong Kong after filming in Mongolia and joined Cheuk in revising the script. Cheuk retitled the film as Time Still Turns the Pages, drawing inspiration from the lyrics of Avenged Sevenfold's ""So Far Away"". Movie critic and secondary school teacher Chan Kwong-lung was also invited to be a consultant for the film. After filming, Cheuk and Keith Chan, both first-time film editors, spent an additional two years on post-production. An official trailer was released on 27 September 2023.

 Casting 
In September 2021, shortly after finishing the screenplay draft, Cheuk approached Siuyea Lo, a mutual friend of his and his deceased friend, and offered him the role of Mr. Cheng. The original setting of Mr. Cheng was actually 40 years old and spoke in a much more mature manner. Lo accepted the role on the spot after reading the script, and Cheuk amended the settings for him. Besides, Cheuk handpicked comedian actor Ronald Cheng for the role of a stubborn and abusive father, after seeing Louis Cheung's performance in The Narrow Road and wanting to bring out the emotional side of actors who appear comedic. Cheuk also chose Henick Chou to portray Vincent, a character based on his own experiences growing up at school, as he found Chou's previous portrayals of slacker youths very convincing. Child actor Sean Wong won his role through an audition.

 Filming 
Principal photography began in 2021 and wrapped up in 19 days. Most of the school scenes were filmed at Chiu Yang Por Yen Primary School, Tin Shui Wai, and the farewell scene between Cheng and Sherry was filmed at an art store in Sham Shui Po.

 Release 
Time Still Turns the Pages had its world premiere in the Asian New Talent section of the 25th Shanghai International Film Festival on 11 June 2023. The film was also screened as the opening film of 20th Hong Kong Asian Film Festival on 13 October 2023, and in World Focus section of the 36th Tokyo International Film Festival. It was released theatrically on 16 November 2023 in Hong Kong.

 Reception 
 Box office 
Time Still Turns the Pages initially grossed approximately million during its first weekend, not making it to the top three at the box office. After receiving positive reviews from critics, the film saw a significant boost and climbed to million, surpassing Napoleon, Trolls Band Together, Sound of Freedom, and local production In Broad Daylight, securing the top position at the box office. By the fourth weekend, the film had grossed over million, and surpassed million by the eighth weekend, making it the second highest-grossing film of 2023 in Hong Kong. As of 19 February 2024, the film's total gross stood at over million. It was the second highest-grossing Hong Kong film domestically in 2023.

 Critical response 
Edmund Lee of South China Morning Post gave the film 4/5 stars and lauded the film for its powerful emotional impact, crediting Siuyea Lo's impressive performance as Mr. Cheng and the execution of a clever plot twist that effectively convey layers of emotion within the film's poignant and heavy-hearted tone. Lee also ranked the film second out of the 37 Hong Kong films theatrically released in 2023. Mátin Cheung of The Student gave the film 4/5 stars and acknowledged Cheuk's thoughtful utilization of a complex narrative structure to reveal the harsh realities of Hong Kong's ailing education system and suffocating household atmosphere, while simultaneously challenging audience biases, showcasing the talent of the new generation of Hong Kong filmmakers.

Phuong Le of The Guardian gave the film 3/5 stars, praising director Nick Cheuk's sensitive portrayal of taboo topics like childhood abuse and academic pressure, as the film skillfully explored a debilitating cycle of trauma through the intertwined stories of a high school teacher and a young boy. Alan Chu of United Daily News also found the film to powerfully address themes of personal and societal trauma through its intricate storytelling and emotional depth, making it a poignant reflection on contemporary Hong Kong.

Keith Ho, writing for HK01, referred to the film as the best film of 2023, commending its excellent script and performances while effectively exploring themes of communication and the emotional struggles of its characters. Estella Huang of Mirror Media perceived the film as a profound and emotionally resonant work, exploring melancholic childhoods and the limitations of education with depth and nuance through the adept navigation of Cheuk.

 Usage 
M. O. Maksymovych proposed new letters for usage in the Ukrainian Alphabet, based on the etymological principles of spelling to preserve the old writing of Ukrainian. Of the letters proposed Е̂ was one of them.

This letter is also used in some dialects of Bulgarian and Serbian (плèте̂мо or клàде̂).

It is also found in the northern dialect of Udege.

390,40882,5364408,4836,Hide and Seek (Rankin novel),"Hide and Seek is a 1991 crime novel by Ian Rankin. It is the second of the Inspector Rebus novels. This novel is not to be confused with James Patterson's 1996 novel Hide and Seek.

Plot summary

Detective Inspector John Rebus finds the body of a drug addict in an Edinburgh squat, apparently dead of an overdose, but laid out cross-like on the floor, between two burned-down candles, with a five-pointed star painted on the wall above. Some of his colleagues are inclined to categorise it as the routine death of a ""junkie"", but Rebus is perturbed by some unusual facts of the case: a full package of heroin in the dead man's room, and some mysterious bruises on his face and body. 

As Rebus feels that this case looks increasingly like a murder, he begins to investigate. As part of this investigation, Rebus finds a young woman named Tracy who knew the dead man and heard his last words: ""Hide! Hide!""

It emerges that the dead man took and hid some sensitive photos in a specialist private members' club named Hyde's, where highly connected people in society watch illegal boxing matches. Rebus is able to arrest Hyde's owner and several high-profile members, but to his disgust all die suspicious deaths while imprisoned: the powers-that-be are covering it up to prevent scandal.

Connections to other Rankin books
 Rian, a character who appears in Rankin's first novel, The Flood, reappears in this book.
 Rebus remembers journalist Jim Stevens from Knots and Crosses, and that he has since moved to London and married a girl ""half his age"" - a reference to Stevens in Watchman.
 When encountering a rentboy, Rebus has a brief flashback to Gordon Reeve from Knots and Crosses.
 Recurring characters Brian Holmes, a fellow detective, and Superintendent ""Farmer"" Watson first appear here.

Writing Hide and Seek
In the Exile on Princes Street foreword to Rebus: The Early Years, Rankin says this was his second attempt at updating Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde into then-modern Edinburgh (""one reviewer 'got it'""), and with this book he began to like Rebus as a character and thought he could use him as a recurring mouthpiece for stories about his views on Scotland. 

He also noted that, shortly after moving to London, there was a real-life case of male prostitutes bribing lawyers and judges, similar to some parts of the book: ""questions were asked in parliament"" and two lawyers began to investigate the police investigation. ""To everyone's surprise, this inquiry found that the allegations were false. Police officers involved in the case found themselves demoted...""

It determined the champion of the 2023–24 NCAA Division I women's basketball season and was contested by the Iowa Hawkeyes from the Big Ten Conference and the South Carolina Gamecocks from the Southeastern Conference. The game was played on April 7, 2024, at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in Cleveland, Ohio. South Carolina defeated Iowa 87–75 to capture the third national championship in program history. Iowa finished as runner-up for the second season in a row.

Iowa scored the game's first ten points and led by seven points at the end of the first quarter behind an NCAA championship-record eighteen points from Caitlin Clark. South Carolina started the second quarter scoring seven consecutive points to tie the game, 27–27, and South Carolina's Kamilla Cardoso gave her team the lead with five minutes left in the half. Shots made by both teams kept the game close and the Gamecocks took a three-point lead into halftime after baskets by Te-Hina Paopao and Raven Johnson. The South Carolina lead was stretched to nine points shortly into the third quarter and a Johnson three-point field goal pushed it to eleven points before a layup by Sydney Affolter brought the Hawkeyes' deficit back to nine. The start of the fourth quarter saw South Carolina take a thirteen-point lead, shortly followed by three-pointers by Clark and Gabbie Marshall. The end of the fourth quarter saw a 7–0 run by South Carolina that finalized their championship victory, 87–75. South Carolina's Cardoso was named Most Outstanding Player (MOP) following her 15-point, 17-rebound performance.

Participants
Iowa Hawkeyes

The Hawkeyes, representing the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa, were led by head coach Lisa Bluder in her 24th season at the school. Ranked No. 3 in the Associated Press (AP) preseason poll, they won their first three games of the season, including a neutral site win over No. 8 Virginia Tech in Charlotte, North Carolina, before suffering a loss to Kansas State. They participated in the Gulf Coast Showcase, where they defeated Purdue Fort Wayne, Florida Gulf Coast, and avenged their loss to Kansas State. In Big Ten Conference play, the Hawkeyes defeated Michigan State 76–73 on a three-point buzzer beater by Caitlin Clark and scored home victories over No. 14 Indiana and No. 2 Ohio State. They finished 15–3 in the conference, with those losses coming on the road to Ohio State and Indiana, along with Nebraska, which rallied from 14 points down in the 4th quarter to send Iowa home with a defeat. Caitlin Clark earned consensus national player of the year honors. The Hawkeyes received the No. 2 seed in the Big Ten tournament, where they defeated Penn State, Michigan and Nebraska en route to their third consecutive conference tournament championship.

Iowa received the Big Ten's automatic invitation to the NCAA tournament by virtue of their conference tournament championship and were selected as the No. 1 seed in the Albany Regional 2. The Hawkeyes hosted first- and second-round games at their home arena, Carver–Hawkeye Arena in Iowa City, and they defeated No. 16 seed Holy Cross in their first-round game. The other first-round game played in Iowa City saw No. 8 seed West Virginia defeat No. 9 seed Princeton, and Iowa defeated West Virginia by ten points in the second round to advance to the regional semifinal. There, they faced and defeated No. 5 seed Colorado at MVP Arena in Albany, and they took down No. 3 seed LSU 94–87 in a rematch of the previous year's national championship game. That game drew 12.3 million viewers, at the time the most ever for a women's college basketball game. They won 71–69 over UConn in the national semifinal  establishing a new viewership mark at 14.2 million viewers  to reach the national championship game for the second year in a row.

South Carolina Gamecocks

The Gamecocks, representing the University of South Carolina in Columbia, South Carolina, were led by head coach Dawn Staley in her 16th season at the school. They began the season No. 6 in the AP Poll's preseason rankings and elevated to No. 1, securing twenty-three of thirty-six first place votes, by November 13 after two early wins over No. 10 Notre Dame and No. 14 Maryland. South Carolina earned further non-conference wins over AP-ranked teams against No. 24 North Carolina and No. 11 Utah, and the Gamecocks entered conference play with a 12–0 record. The team completed a perfect 16–0 season in conference play, with only two games decided by a single-digit margin (9-point win at No. 9 LSU and an 8-point win at home over Tennessee). South Carolina also won a non-conference game over No. 11 UConn on February 11 and finished the regular season with a 29–0 record.

South Carolina received the automatic invitation from the Southeastern Conference (SEC) to the NCAA tournament by defeating Texas A&M, Tennessee, and No 8 LSU to secure the conference tournament championship and were selected as the No. 1 seed in the Albany Regional 1. Like Iowa, the Gamecocks hosted first- and second-round games at their home arena, Colonial Life Arena in Columbia, and they defeated No. 16 seed Presbyterian in their first-round game. The other first-round game played in Columbia saw No. 8 seed North Carolina defeat No. 9 seed Michigan State, and South Carolina defeated North Carolina by 47 points in the second round to advance to the regional semifinal. There, they faced and defeated No. 4 seed Indiana at MVP Arena in Albany, and beat No. 3 seed Oregon State 70–58 to reach the Final Four for the fourth consecutive season. They won 78–59 over NC State in the national semifinal to reach the national championship game for the second time in three seasons, and they entered the championship game looking to finish as the 10th unbeaten national champion in women's NCAA basketball history. Entering this game, South Carolina had won 79 of 80 games, with the only loss coming to Iowa in the 2023 national semifinal round.

Starting lineups

Game summary

The game began with South Carolina winning the opening tip, and Iowa opened the game's scoring with a three-point jump shot made by Iowa's Kate Martin twenty-two seconds in. Another made shot by Martin was followed by jumpers by Sydney Affolter and Caitlin Clark, giving Iowa a 10–0 lead to begin the game. South Carolina's first made shot came nearly three minutes into the game on a Kamilla Cardoso layup. Clark attempted six free throws over the next minute and a half of game time, making five, along with a layup and a three-point shot; South Carolina scored on shots by Te-Hina Paopao, Cardoso, and Chloe Kitts. With Iowa leading 20–9, neither team scored for nearly a minute before Sania Feagin broke the drought with a layup, followed by a layup by MiLaysia Fulwiley. After two free throws by Martin, South Carolina scored on shots by Fulwiley and Tessa Johnson and narrowed Iowa' lead to two points. Clark ended the quarter with two consecutive jump shots, giving Iowa a 27–20 lead. Clark's eighteen points in the first quarter were an NCAA championship record. The second quarter began with South Carolina scoring seven unanswered points via Johnson and Cardoso, tying the game at 27 points apiece. Affolter scored Iowa's first points of the quarter on a three-point jumper two minutes in. The teams then traded baskets and South Carolina took a two-point lead with Cardoso's made layup with 4:58 remaining in the half. Stuelke reestablished Iowa's lead but Kitts tied the game again with a free throw, though shots made shortly after by Stuelke and Martin put Iowa back ahead by four points. The teams traded the lead for the remainder of the quarter and the Gamecocks finished the half with made shots by Paopao and Raven Johnson and took a three-point lead into halftime.

The Gamecocks began the second half with possession of the ball and extended their lead to nine points in short order with made shots by Kitts and Paopao; a Clark jump shot with 7:15 left marked Iowa's first points of the half and narrowed South Carolina's lead to 55–48. The teams traded field goals for the next few minutes, with South Carolina maintaining the lead. Consecutive three-point shots by Johnson and Bree Hall extended the Gamecocks' advantage to ten points; after Martin made two free throws for Iowa, Johnson made another three-pointer to put her team ahead by eleven. After an Iowa timeout, Affolter made a layup with fifty-one seconds remaining in the third quarter to narrow the deficit to nine points; the quarter ended with no further scoring and South Carolina took a 68–59 lead into the final quarter. South Carolina's lead expanded to thirteen points with eight minutes remaining in the game. A Clark three-pointer a minute later made the score 76–67, and Marshall made a three-pointer of her own shortly afterwards to narrow the deficit to six points. Made shots by Martin and Affolter kept the Gamecocks' lead to five after a Hall jump shot, though South Carolina scored the next seven points on shots by Paopao, Cardoso, Watkins, and Johnson. Leading 87–75, South Carolina was able to run the remaining time off of the clock and secure a national championship victory.

Media coverage
For the second consecutive season, the championship game was televised in the United States by ABC. Ryan Ruocco was the play-by-play commentator, Rebecca Lobo was the analyst, and Holly Rowe was the sideline reporter. ESPN presented Megacast coverage of the game, an alternate broadcast hosted by The Bird & Taurasi Show with Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi on ESPN and ESPN+, and rail cam and data-enhanced (""Beyond the Rim"") broadcasts on ESPN+.

Nielsen ratings reported that the final was seen by 18.7 million viewers—the largest-ever audience for a women's basketball game in the United States, and an 89 percent year-over-increase over 2023. It was the third consecutive tournament game to break the record in a single week, following the Elite Eight match between Iowa and LSU on April 1 (which had drawn 12.3 million viewers) and the Final Four match between Iowa and UConn on April 5 (which had drawn 14.2 million viewers). The game was the most-watched basketball game of any kind broadcast by an ESPN network since 2019. It was the second most-watched non-Olympic women's sporting event ever broadcast on live U.S. television, behind only the 2015 Women's World Cup final.

Aftermath
South Carolina's national championship victory marked the first undefeated national championship season in Division I women's basketball since UConn in 2016. Kamilla Cardoso was named Most Outstanding Player (MOP). The championship was the third for South Carolina head coach Dawn Staley, making her just the fifth coach to win three NCAA Division I women's basketball championships. It was the third title in South Carolina program history; the team had never advanced past the national semifinal round prior to Staley's arrival. Several days before the game, Staley was named Naismith College Coach of the Year for the third consecutive year and the fourth year overall.

The 2024 WNBA draft was held on April 17 and saw players from both teams selected: Clark was picked first overall by the Indiana Fever, Cardoso was chosen third by the Chicago Sky, and Iowa's Kate Martin was drafted to the Las Vegas Aces with the eighteenth pick.

393,29011,75793742,7404,Lines of amity,"During European empire-building overseas, the lines of amity were demarcation lines that distinguished between European states and the rest of the world. The line was generally drawn west of the Canary Islands and south of the Tropic of Cancer. It is often referred to in literature as ""the line"".

 Origin 
In 1552, as French privateers threatened shipping, the Spanish and Portuguese signed an agreement to protect their fleets in the Indies. In a truce to settle tensions, the French agreed to end trade and navigation in the area. As a part of the 1559 Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis, an oral agreement between Spain and France clarified that the French could navigate west of the 16th-century prime meridian and south of the Tropic of Cancer, but at their own risk. Although the treaty doesn't involve the other European states' competition in the Americas, it laid the precedent for all foreign affairs of the era. To the north and east lay Europe, while to the south and west was the extra-European world. 

In 1634, French statesman and member of the Catholic Church Cardinal Richelieu wrote, “lines of the amities and alliances” (French: lignes des amitiés et des alliances) in a memorandum.

When it was drawn, there was disagreement among major European powers over where the line of longitude lay. The line of demarcation drawn by the papal state in 1493 is 100 leagues west of the Azores, whereas the line determined by the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas trends further west.Elizabeth Mancke, ""Empire and State"" in David Armitage and Michael J. Bradick, eds.. The British Atlantic World, 1500-1800 (New York, 2002), 175. The Treaty aimed to divide territory among Portugal and Spain. Originally, all territory east of about 555 kilometers (345 miles) west of the Cape Verde islands belonged to Portugal, but eventually it moved about 1500 kilometers (932 miles) west in 1506 so that Portugal could claim the east of Brazil.

 Significance 
The lines represented an important tension between Britain and their colonies in the 18th century. The expanse of the Atlantic only furthered the cultural, political, and social differences between Europe and the New World. The lines established a division between domestic European affairs and the happenings in the Americas. Namely, that the turmoil and conflict west of the lines were confined there, whereas the powerful orchestrators of international relations stayed in Europe.Savelle, Max. “Colonial Origins of American Diplomatic Principles.” Pacific Historical Review, vol. 3, no. 3, 1934, pp. 334–50. JSTOR, . Accessed 12 Jan. 2024.

Actions beyond the newly drawn lines of amity would not be considered a violation of international peace. As a result, they exacerbated the legal differences between Europe and its colonies. By separating the conflicts that happened outside of Europe, extraterritorial violence didn't interrupt the peace of interstate treaties. The lines allowed for European powers to declare war and fight for territory overseas while maintaining ""amity"" at home. This phenomenon is often referred to as: ""no peace beyond the line.""Shirk, Mark. ""2. THE GOLDEN AGE OF PIRACY AND THE CREATION OF AN ATLANTIC WORLD"".

While primarily fictive and not written in any formal treaty, they effectively created two different systems of foreign relations: that of the European mainland and that of their colonies.

Since international law was void west of the lines, the lines marked a shift in the necessity to maintain negotiations between world powers. The foundations of international order began to be laid when powers dissociated their federal government structures, from that of their colonies. Everyone beyond the lines were subjects, not citizens. The lines forced European politicians and monarchs to question to what extend they should, and were able, to restrict the political freedom and autonomy of colonies thousands of miles away. As a result, both Britain's imperial identity and national institutions are impacted by power-struggles from the age of colonialism.",2024-02-11,['History of European colonialism'],"['empire' 'demarcation line' 'Canary Islands' 'Tropic of Cancer' 'French'

395,16417,75446810,96413,The Wonderful Sea-Horse,"The Wonderful Sea-Horse is an Iranian folktale collected from storyteller Mashdi Galeen Khanom and published by Laurence Paul Elwell-Sutton. It is classified in the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as ATU 314, ""Goldener"". It deals with a friendship between a king's son and a magic horse that comes from the sea; both are later forced to flee for their lives due to the boy's own sisters, and reach another kingdom, where the boy adopts another identity.

Although it differs from variants wherein a hero acquires golden hair, its starting sequence (persecution by the hero's female relative, e.g., his sisters) is considered by scholarship as an alternate opening to the same tale type.

 Origin 
The tale was provided by a female storyteller from Iran named Mashdī Galīn Khānom, and published by L. P. Elwell-Sutton.Márkus, K. (1995). [Review of Die Erzählungen der Mašdi Galin Hānom / Qessehā-ye Mashdī Galīn Khānom [The Tales of Mashdī Galīn Khānom]; Dāstānhā-ye-širin: Fünfzig persische Volksbüchlein aus der zweiten Hälfte des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts [Sweet Stories: Fifty Persian Chapbooks from the Second Half of the Twentieth Century], by U.

Asian Folklore Studies, 54(2), 354. https://doi.org/10.2307/1178966 German scholar , in his catalogue of Persian folktales, sourced the story from Markazi province.Marzolph, Ulrich. Typologie des persischen Volksmärchens. Beirut: Orient-Inst. der Deutschen Morgenländischen Ges.; Wiesbaden: Steiner [in Komm.], 1984. p. 69 (entry nr. 1).

 Summary 
A king has many daughters, but only one son, Prince Ebrahim, whom he dotes on, to the girls' jealousy. One day, some huntsmen bring to the palace a sea-horse they have captured, which the prince wants to himself. The king buys him the horse and takes it to the stalls, feeding it sweets and comfits instead of hay or barley. Years later, when the boy is 13 years old, the princesses, his sisters, begin to hate him, and decide to kill him: first, they hire well-diggers to dig up a hole in his room, place knives, spikes and swords inside it, and cover it with carpets. One day, Prince Ebrahim goes home from school and goes to meet the horse, finding it weeping for him, since the princesses are trying to kill him and prepared a trap in his room. With the horse's warning, he jumps onver the trap, uncovers the carpet and goes to tell his father. The king then investigates into the matter, and traces the order to the princesses, although they deny any involvement.

Next, the girls bribe the cook to poison their brother's food. However, Ebrahim is again warned of the danger by his sea-horse: he feeds the cat with it and it dies. The king once again traces the assassination attempt to his daughters, and still they deny it. The princesses notice that their plans failed and discover the reason: a stableboy tells them the sea-horse is helping their brother. Thus, Fatima, the youngest princess, whom the king loves most of all the princesses, feigns illness and ask for the sea-horse's blood as cure. The king is torn at the decision, but his viziers advise him to let the teacher keep him at school while they sacrifice the horse.

Prince Ebrahim goes to meet the sea-horse again in the evening, and is told of the course of action they plan to take. The sea-horse worries for the boy, and conspires with the prince how they can escape: the prince is to pocket some jewels and his finest garments, then pocket some ashes to throw at his teacher and some pennies at the students to distract them, while the sea-horse will neigh three times to alert the prince; when he rushes back to the palace, he is to ask for a last ride on the animal, three times around the yard. The next morning, it happens thus: the prince rides around three times, each time confessing to his father about the attempts on his life, and flies away on the horse to another realm.

When they land, a shepherd informs Ebrahim he is near the castle of the King of the Eastern Lands. The sea-horse advises the prince to find work as a gardener's assistant and gives some of its hairs to the boy, to summon him in case he needs the animal's help, and goes to graze in his original homeland. Prince Ebrahim finds work as the royal gardener's assistant, spinning a story about being an orphan boy. One day, he sees his employer preparing flower bunches for the king's three daughters, and asks if he can arrange some and bring to the princesses. Ebrahim takes the flowers and goes to the terrace where the princesses are, and gives his bunch to the youngest, named Pari, to her sisters' envy. One day, Prince Ebrahim summons his sea-horse, for he wants to ride around the garden as the prince to impress princess Pari: both make a show of strength to her delight, who falls even more in love with him.

Later, the king orders for a crowd to be assembled in front of the palace, where the princesses shall choose their husbands by releasing a falcon at random and, whoever it lands on, they shall marry them. The first falcon lands on the head of the son of the vizier of the right hand, and the second on the son of the vizier of the left hand. The third falcon lands on the head of the gardener, Prince Ebrahim, but, knowing he is a poor choice, the guards remove him from the crowd. Ebrahim sits by the public baths, and the third falcon, released a second time, lands on his head again. Thinking the bird made the same mistake, the viziers order the boy to be taken back to his garden outside of the town. The third falcon is released a third time, and again it circles around in the air until it finds Ebrahim in the garden.

The king ponders about the situation (two fine sons-in-law for his elder daughters, a lowly one for his youngest), and decides to marry the elder two in grand ceremonies with pomp, while the youngest is wedded like a poor servant and moves out to a humble part of town. Time passes, and the king falls ill; the royal doctors prescribe that only meat from a gazelle, a deer or other game animal is to be given to him as remedy. Pari convinces her husband to join in the hunt, and asks her father to lend him a horse. Back to Prince Ebrahim, he summons his loyal horse again, and says it is almost time to end the charade, so that he is given the respect and honour he is due. The sea-horse understands the message, goes away for a while, then returns to fetch the prince. When they reach the wilderness, there is a large pavilion with a throne, and every wild animal has been herded there.

The king's two sons-in-law cannot find any game, until they sight the pavilion from a distance and go near it. They meet Prince Ebrahim, whom they do not recognize, and ask for some of the gazelles for the king. Prince Ebrahim makes a deal: the gazelle meat in exchange for brandind the duo as his slaves. The sons-in-law agree to do it, since no one will know of the transaction, then go back to the king. Ebrahim keeps the gazelle heads for himself and asks his wife to prepare a dish for her father. The king eats the dishes made from the gazelle meat and does not recover, until he eats the dish made from the heads and his health improves.

Later, Ebrahim asks his wife to invite her father to visit their home, and he summons the sea-horse once again, so that their humble hut is turned into a wonderful palace. It happens overnight, and the king appears with his court to visit the newly built palace, which is richly decorated and furnished. After a splendid meal, the king wishes his host, whom he does not recognize as the gardener's assistant, could have been one of his sons-in-law. Prince Ebrahim then admits he is the gardener, and the king's son-in-law, while his brothers-in-law are Ebrahim's slaves, marked with a royal brand on their chests. The viziers' sons show their marks, confirming Ebrahim's story, and the king celebrates Pari's wedding to Ebrahim. At the end of the tale, Ebrahim returns to his homeland with his wife and slaves, and his sisters having repented of their previous actions.Mashdi Galeen Khanom; Elwell-Sutton, Laurence Paul. The Wonderful Sea-horse: And Other Persian Tales. G. Bles, 1950. pp. 11-34. .

Analysis
Tale type
The tale is classified in the Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as type ATU 314, ""The Goldener"": a youth with golden hair works as the king's gardener. The type may also open with the prince for some reason being the servant of an evil being, where he gains the same gifts, and the tale proceeds as in this variant. In this case, it is an ""independent Near Eastern subtype of AT 314"".

Professor , in his catalogue of Persian folktales, named type 314 in Iranian sources as Das Zauberfohlen (""The Magic Horse""):Marzolph, Ulrich. ""Iranian Tales"". In: The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales. Volume 2: G-P. Edited by Donald Haase. Westport, Connecticut; London: Greenwood Press, 2008. p. 501. . the horse saves the protagonist from jealous relatives and takes him to another kingdom; in this kingdom, the protagonist is advised by the horse to dress in shabby garments (as a ""Kačal"") and work as the king's gardener; a princess falls in love with him. Marzolph listed 17 variants of this type across Persian sources.Marzolph, Ulrich. Typologie des persischen Volksmärchens. Beirut: Orient-Inst. der Deutschen Morgenländischen Ges.; Wiesbaden: Steiner [in Komm.], 1984. pp. 68–70 (entry nr. 1). In addition, according to Marzolph, the tale type, also known as Korre-ye daryā'i (German: Das Meeresfohlen; English: ""The Sea Foal""), is one of the most collected types in the archives of Markaz-e farhang-e mardom (Centre of Popular Culture),Marzolph, Ulrich.

 Introductory episodes 
Scholarship notes three different opening episodes to the tale type: (1) the hero becomes a magician's servant and is forbidden to open a certain door, but he does and dips his hair in a pool of gold; (2) the hero is persecuted by his stepmother, but his loyal horse warns him and later they both flee; (3) the hero is given to the magician as payment for the magician's help with his parents' infertility problem.Bolte, Johannes; Polívka, Jiri.

American folklorist Barre Toelken recognized the spread of the tale type across Northern, Eastern and Southern Europe, but identified three subtypes: one that appears in Europe (Subtype 1), wherein the protagonist becomes the servant to a magical person, finds the talking horse and discovers his benefactor's true evil nature, and acquires a golden colour on some part of his body; a second narrative (Subtype 3), found in Greece, Turkey, Caucasus, Uzbekistan and Northern India, where the protagonist is born through the use of a magical fruit; and a third one (Subtype 2). According to Toelken, this Subtype 2 is ""the oldest"", being found ""in Southern Siberia, Iran, the Arabian countries, Mediterranean, Hungary and Poland"". In this subtype, the hero (who may be a prince) and the foal are born at the same time and become friends, but their lives are at stake when the hero's mother asks for the horse's vital organ (or tries to kill the boy to hide her affair), which motivates their flight from their homeland to another kingdom.Toelken, Barre. ""The Icebergs of Folktale: Misconception, Misuse, Abuse"". In: Carol L. Birch and Melissa A. Heckler, eds. Who Says? – Essays on Pivotal Issues in Contemporary Storytelling. Little Rock, Arkansas: August House Publishers, 1996. pp. 42-43.

Motifs
Professor Anna Birgitta Rooth stated that the motif of the stepmother's persecution of the hero appears in tale type 314 in variants from Slavonic, Eastern European and Near Eastern regions. She also connected this motif to part of the Cinderella cycle, in a variation involving a male hero and his cow.Rooth, Anna Birgitta. The Cinderella Cycle. Lund, 1951. pp. 138-139.

 The suitor selection test 
In Iranian tales about the sea-horse, the princess throws an apple to her suitor - a motif indexed as motif H316, ""Suitor test: apple thrown indicates princess' choice (often golden apple)"". According to mythologist Yuri Berezkin and other Russian researchers, the motif is ""popular"" in Iran, and is also attested ""in Central Europe, the Balkans, the Caucasus, the Near East, and Central Asia"". In the same vein, professor  noted that the motif of the princess throwing an item to choose her husband is ""widespread"" (""распространение"", in the original) in tales from the Iranian peoples.Персидские народные сказки. Сост. М.-Н. О. Османов, предисл. Д. С. Комиссарова. М., Главная редакция восточной литературы издательства «Наука», 1987. p. 489.

According to Turkologist , types ATU 314 and ATU 502 contain this motif: the princess chooses her own husband (of lowly appearance) in a gathering of potential suitors, by giving him an object (e.g., an apple). However, he also remarks that the motif is ""spread in folk literature"" and may appear in other tale types.Reichl, Karl. Turkic Oral Epic Poetry: Traditions, Forms, Poetic Structure. Routledge Revivals. Routledge. 1992. p. 136. .

Germanist , in Enzyklopädie des Märchens, argued that Subtype 2 (see above) represented the oldest form of the Goldener narrative, since the golden apple motif in the suitor selection roughly appears in the geographic distribution of the same subtype.Dammann, Günter. ""Goldener (AaTh 314)"" [Goldener (ATU 314)]. In: Enzyklopädie des Märchens Online, edited by Rolf Wilhelm Brednich, Heidrun Alzheimer, Hermann Bausinger, Wolfgang Brückner, Daniel Drascek, Helge Gerndt, Ines Köhler-Zülch, Klaus Roth and Hans-Jörg Uther. Berlin, Boston: De Gruyter, 2016 [1987]. pp. 1379-1380. https://www-degruyter-com.wikipedialibrary.idm.oclc.org/database/EMO/entry/emo.5.211/html. Accessed 2023-06-22.

 Literary parallels 
Some scholars have compared the motif to marriage rites and customs attested in ancient literature. For example, Günter Dammann, in Enzyklopädie des Märchens, compared the motif to the Indian ritual of svayamvara, and reported evidence of a similar practice in Ancient Iran.

French folklorist Emmanuel Cosquin noted that the suitor selection test was component of a larger narrative: the princess or bride-to-be chooses the hero, in lowly disguise, by throwing him an apple. According to him, this motif would be comparable to the ancient Indian ritual of svayamvara, wherein the bride, in a public gathering, would choose a husband by giving him a garland of flowers. In addition, Swedish scholar Waldemar Liungman (1948), who argued for its remote antiquity, saw in the golden apple motif a mark of the princess's self-choice of husband, and traced a parallel between it and a narrative cited by Aristotle regarding the founding of Massalia (modern day Marseille).

Similarly, in an ancient treatise written by historian Mirkhond, translated by linguist David Shea, it is reported that prince Gushtasp went to the land of ""Room"" during a suitor selection test held by princess Kitabun: as it was custom, a maiden of marriageable age was to walk through an assemblage of noble men with an orange and throw it to her husband-to-be. Gushtasp attends the event and the princess throws her orange to him, indicating her choice.Mirkhond; Shea, Daniel (translator). History of the early kings of Persia. 1832. pp. 267-268.Персидские народные сказки. Сост. М.-Н. О. Османов, предисл. Д. С. Комиссарова. Moskva: Главная редакция восточной литературы издательства «Наука», 1987. p. 489.

In regards to a similar tale from the Dungan people, according to Sinologist , the motif of a princess (or woman of high social standing) throwing a silken ball atop a high tower to choose her husband is reported in the ancient Chinese story of ""Lu Meng-Zheng"": the princess throws a silken ball to a passing youth named Meng-Zheng (a poor student), and the king expels his daughter to live with her husband in a cave.""Дунганские народные сказки и предания"" [Dungan Folktales and Legends]. Составители [Compilers]: Махмуд Хасанов, Ильяс Юсупов. Moskva: Главная редакция восточной литературы издательства «Наука», 1977. p. 438. In addition, some scholars (e.g., , Wolfram Eberhard, ) remarked that a similar wedding folk custom (a maiden throwing a ball from a balcony to her husband of choice) was practiced among some Chinese minoritiesNai-tung TING. A Type Index of Chinese Folktales in the Oral Tradition and Major Works of Non-religious Classical Literature. FF Communications, no. 223. Helsinki, Academia Scientiarum Fennica, 1978. p. 76. and in South China. The motif is also reported in ancient Chinese literature.

 The gardener hero 
Swedish scholar  drew attention to a possible ancient parallel to the gardener hero of the tale type: in an account of the story of king Sargon of Akkad, he, in his youth, works as a gardener in a palace and attracts the attention of goddess Ishtar.Liungman, Waldemar. Traditionswanderungen: Euphrat-Rhein; Studien zur Geschichte der Volksbräuche. Folklore Fellows Communications Volume 118. Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia, 1937. pp. 75-77. According to scholars Wolfram Eberhard and Pertev Naili Boratav, this would mean that the motif is ""very old"" (""sehr alt"") in the Near East.Eberhard, Wolfram; Boratav, Pertev Nailî. Typen türkischer Volksmärchen. Wiesbaden: Steiner, 1953. p. 313.

According to Richard MacGillivray Dawkins, in the tale type, the hero as gardener destroys and restores the garden after he finds work, and, later, fights in the war. During the battle, he is injured, and the king dresses his wound with a kerchief, which will serve as token of recognition.Dawkins, Richard McGillivray. Modern Greek folktales. Oxford: Clarendon Press. 1953. p. 249.

 The helpful horse 
According to scholars James R. Russell and Wheeler Thackston, the bahri, merhorse or sea-stallion appears in the folklore of Iranian peoples. On its own, the merhorse is a fantastical equine imbued with human speech, the ability to fly and other magical powers, and acts as the hero's helper.Boulvin, Adrienne.

In addition, according to Gudrun Schubert and Renate Würsch, the horse may be known as Asp-i-baḥrī ('Meerpferd'), that is, an equine that lives in the sea or other water bodies. The merhorse or its foal also appear in epic tradition as the hero's mount.Schubert, Gudrun, and Renate Würsch. ""Wert und Unwert des Romans"".

 Quest for the remedy 
A motif that appears in tale type 314 is the hero having to find a cure for the ailing king, often the milk of a certain animal (e.g., a lioness). According to scholar Erika Taube, this motif occurs in tales from North Africa to East Asia, even among Persian- and Arabic-speaking peoples.Taube, Erika. ""Löwenmilch"" [Lion's Milk]. In: Enzyklopädie des Märchens Online. Edited by Rolf Wilhelm Brednich, Heidrun Alzheimer, Hermann Bausinger, Wolfgang Brückner, Daniel Drascek, Helge Gerndt, Ines Köhler-Zülch, Klaus Roth and Hans-Jörg Uther. Berlin, Boston: De Gruyter, 2016 [1996]. pp. 1232-1233. Similarly, Hasan M. El-Shamy noted that the quest for the king's remedy appears as a subsidiary event ""in the Arab-Berber culture area"". In addition, Germanist Gunter Dammann, in Enzyklopädie des Märchens, noted that the motif of the quest for the remedy appeared ""with relative frequency"" in over half of the variants that start with the Subtype 2 opening (stepmother's persecution of hero and horse).Dammann, Günter. ""Goldener (AaTh 314)"". In: Enzyklopädie des Märchens Band 5: Fortuna – Gott ist auferstanden. Edited by Rudolf Wilhelm Brednich; Hermann Bausinger; Wolfgang Brückner; Helge Gerndt; Lutz Röhrich; Klaus Roth. De Gruyter, 2016 [1987]. pp. 1374-1375, 1377. .

 Branding the brothers-in-law 
According to German scholars Günther Damman and Kurt Ranke, another motif that appears in tale type ATU 314 is the hero branding his brothers-in-law during their hunt.Dammann, Günter. ""Goldener (AaTh 314)"". In: Enzyklopädie des Märchens Band 5: Fortuna – Gott ist auferstanden. Edited by Rudolf Wilhelm Brednich; Hermann Bausinger; Wolfgang Brückner; Helge Gerndt; Lutz Röhrich; Klaus Roth. De Gruyter, 2016 [1987]. p. 1375. . in  Likewise, Ranke stated that the hero's branding represented a mark of his ownership over his brothers-in-law.

Ranke located the motif in the Orient and in the Mediterranean. In the same vein, Hungarian professor Ákos Dömötör, in the notes to tale type ATU 314 in the Hungarian National Catalogue of Folktales (MNK), remarked that the motif was a ""reflection of the Eastern legal custom"", which also appears in the Turkic epic Alpamysh.Dömötör Ákos (szerk.). Magyar népmesekatalógus 2. Budapest, MTA Néprajzi Kutató Csoport, 1988. A magyar tündérmesék katalógusa (AaTh 300-749). pp. 113-114.

Variants
According to Germanist Gunter Dammann, tale type 314 with the opening of hero and horse fleeing home extends from Western Himalaya and South Siberia, to Iran and the Arab-speaking countries in the Eastern Mediterranean.Dammann, Günter. ""Goldener (AaTh 314)"". In: Enzyklopädie des Märchens Band 5: Fortuna – Gott ist auferstanden. Edited by Rudolf Wilhelm Brednich; Hermann Bausinger; Wolfgang Brückner; Helge Gerndt; Lutz Röhrich; Klaus Roth. De Gruyter, 2016 [1987]. pp. 1376-1377. . In addition, scholar Hasan El-Shamy stated that type 314 is ""widely spread throughout north Africa"", among Arabs and Berbers; in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as in Arabia and South Arabia..

 Iran 
 Story of the Sea Horse (Khanom) 
In another Iranian tale collected from teller Mashdi Galin Khanom with the title ""کره دریایی"" (""Sea Foal""), and translated to Italian with the title Storia del cavallo marino (""Story of the Sea Horse""), a king dotes on his only son, whose mother died, to the chagrin of the other co-wives and their daughters. One day, the prince sights a sea horse on sale and takes the king to buy it for him. The king buys the horse and brings it to the royal stables, where they try to feed it sawdust, hay, and barley, but the horse touches nothing. The prince then feeds the animal with sweets and sugarcubes, which the horse accepts. In time, the king's co-wives realize that the prince is too attached to the horse, which means that by hurting the animal, they will hurt the prince. Thus, they bribe the pastry-maker to poison the animal's sugar rations. When the prince goes to the stables, the horse begins to cry and says that it sugar rations are poisoned, since they are trying to kill it to hurt the prince. The prince summons the pastry-maker (""pasticcere"") and one of the dogs (""uno dei cani"", in the Italian translation), feeds the poisoned sweets to the dog, which eats it and dies, just to show the servant the wicked plan. Failing that, the co-queens hire a builder to dig up a hole from outside to the prince's room, for him to fall into. The prince goes to visit the horse again, which warns him of the danger and advises the boy to jump over the carpet covering it. The prince tells his father, who chastises the co-queens, including one that has just given birth to a boy. Furious at another fail, the women bribe the cook to poison the prince's food. The talking sea horse warns the prince about it, who avoids eating the food, but gives it to another dog to eat. The prince then sumons the cook, points to a dead dog and confronts him about it. The queens discover the sea horse is helping their stepson, and conspire with the newly mothered woman to feign illness and ask for sea horse's meat as cure; the king will kill the horse, while they deal with the prince.

It happens thus: the king falls for her trick, and convenes with his ministers, who advise the prince's tutor shall hold the prince a bit longer at school while they sacrifice the horse. Meanwhile, the prince goes to visit the horse and learns they plan to kill it, so they hatch a counterplan: the prince will have some money, clothes and provisions at the ready, go to school with ashes in his pockets; the horse will neigh three times to alert the prince, who is to throw ashes at his teacher and rush to its aid, asking to have a last ride on the animal before it is killed. The next day, at school, the prince hears the neighs, throws some ash at his teacher's eyes and rushes to help his horse, asking his father to have a last ride around the patio three times. It happens thus, and the horse flies away with the prince through the air, until it lands near a garden. They ask a nearby shepherd whose garden it is: it belongs to the daughter of the King of the Eastern Lands. Advised by the horse, the prince eats some sheep meat with the shepherd, places a sheep's intestine on his head, and is given some hairs from its mane to summon the sea horse.

The prince then takes a job as the gardener's assistant. One day, the gardener tells the prince he is preparing some bouquets for the king's three daughters, and the prince offers to make one. The prince prepares a beautiful bouquet, and the gardener sends him to deliver them to the princesses: he gives the gardener's bouquets to the elder two and the one he made to the youngest. Later, the gardener tells his assistant he will leave town and orders him to look after the garden. After the gardener leaves, the prince burns his horse's hairs to summon it, dons the princely clothes, cuts a large tree in two, then dismisses his horse - events witnessed by the youngest princess. The gardener returns and the prince spins a story that some men attacked him, and the youngest princess vouches for him. The youngest princess falls in love with the prince, and conspires with her elder sisters how they can be married, despite being locked in their room: they have the gardener buy three melons of varying ripeness and deliver them to the king. It happens thus, and the ministers interpret the princesses' intention: the melons represent their marriageability, and it is past time they are wedded. The king orders a ""falcon ordeal"" to be prepared, and sends for young and old suitors to be gathered outside the palace, for the princesses will release falcons at random. The elder two release their birds, and they perch on ministers' sons, while the third princess's bird lands on the gardener's assistant. Thinking the bird made a mistake, the assistant is taken to outside the palace, then outside the city's walls, and still the bird lands on him. Ashamed, the king marries the elder two in grand ceremonies, and moves out the youngest to a humble house.

In time, the king falls ill, and only gazelle marrow can cure him. He sends his sons-in-law, the ministers' sons, to hunt some gazelles. The third princess also asks her husband to join in their hunt: the prince summons his loyal sea horse, which rides to the wilderness, builds a tent for its master and draws gazelles, rabbits and every species of animal to the tent. As for the ministers' sons, they have no luck in finding any game, when they spot the animals near the tent. When they try to shoot some gazelles, a servant comes out of the tent and ask them for his master's permission. The tent's occupant is the prince in his real identity, whom the ministers' sons do not recognize. The pair explain they need the meat for their king. The prince agrees to a deal: they can take gazelle meat, but not the heads. The ministers' sons bring gazelle meat, which is prepared into a dish for the monarch. The monarch eats the meal, but his health does not improve. The third princess prepares a dish with the gazelle head and the king's health improves. Impressed, the king invites himself to his daughter's house for a visit (on Friday, in the Italian translation). Back home, the princess tells her husband about the king's visit, but worries about their humble accommodations. The prince then summons his horse again, which creates a palaces for its master and his wife. On the appointed day, the king and his retinue reach his third daughter's house and find a palace instead of a hut. The prince, now assuming his real identity, greets his father-in-law and explains he is the son of the king of the Levant, exiled from home due to his stepmothers' machinations. The king of the Eastern Lands embraces his princely son-in-law and declares him his successor.

 Sea Horse (Sobhi) 
In a Persian tale collected by author Fazl'ollah Mohtadi Sobhi and translated into Russian by Anna Rozenfel'd with the title ""Морской конёк"" (""Sea Horse""), young prince Jamshid loses his mother. On words of a wise man, his father, the padishah, decides to give him a wonderful gift: a horse from the sea, which shall become the boy's best friend. On his orders, his knights capture a horse just as it comes out of the sea. The sea horse is given to Jamshid, and both become great friends. In time, the padishah remarries, and Jamshid grows up; his wife, the prince's step-mother, begins to notice her step-son in a sexual light and tries to seduce him, but he refuses her advances. Out of spite, she conspires with a slave to kill the prince: first, they dig up a hole, fill it with blades and spears, and cover it; next, they try to poison his food. On both occasions, the sea horse warns Jamshid about the danger. The step-mother discovers the horse's help and plots to have it killed: she feigns illness and asks for its heart and liver. Jamshid returns from school one day, and is told of the horse's upcoming execution, so he and the animal devise a plan: the horse will neigh three times, and Jamshid shall meet him before the butcher's strike. The next day, it happens as they planned; Jamshid asks his father to ride the sea horse around the estate one last time. The prince circles the garden six or seven times, then jumps over the garden walls into the unknown and away from his home kingdom. At a distance, the sea horse gives some of its hair to Jamshid, which he can use to summon it, and they part ways. Jamshid goes to another city, where he finds work as assistant to the king's gardener. The king has three daughters, the youngest the most beautiful of the three. The gardener and Jamshid prepare bouquets for the princesses, who notice their delicate craftsmanship. Ten days after parting ways, Jamshid summons the sea horse for a ride around the royal garden - an event witnessed by the youngest princess. Some time later, the three princesses bring melons to their father, the king, as analogy of their marriageability, and the king sets a suitor selection test: the princesses are to throw oranges at their husbands of choice. The elder princess chooses the son of the vizier of the right hand, the middle one the son of the vizier of the left hand, and the princess chooses the gardener's assistant. Much to his disgust, the king expels the youngest princess to a humble life out of the palace, and, after seven days, begins to miss her terribly, so much so he falls ill. The royal doctors then prescribe heads and legs of a gazelle in a dish prepares by the princess, and the three sons-in-law must hunt it down. Prince Jamshid rides ahead of them, summons the sea horse and prepares a large tent for him. He meets his brothers-in-law, who ask him for a piece of gazelle meat. Prince Jamshid agrees to share some of them, as long as he can brand his shoulders with his royal seal. Later, after the king eats the gazelle meat, Jamshid summon the sea horse again and asks for a palace more grandiose than his father-in-law's. He approaches the king and demands his two slaves, and, as proof of his claims, points to his two brothers-in-law. The king then sees his daughter next to Jamshid, and is given an explanation of the ruse. At the end of the tale, Jamshid returns home to cure his father (who has become blind after his son left home), ousts his step-mother, and gets to rule both kingdoms after his father and father-in-law die.""Персидские сказки"" [Persian Fairy Tales].

 The Merhorse (Luristan) 
In a variant from Luristan with the title The Merhorse (Luri language: Bahrî), collected from teller Khudâbas (Xudâwas) of Bahârvand, a king has a son who owns a foal he found in the sea. One day, the king remarries, and the new queen tries to seduce her step-son. He refuses her advances, and she conspires against him: first, she tries to poison her step-son's food twice, but the prince's friend, the merhorse, warns him against eating the food; next, she feigns sickness and asks for the meat of the prince's merhorse. The prince learns of this and plots with the horse: on the day of the animal's execution, the boy is to be allowed a last ride on it, and must take the opportunity to flee. It happens according to their plan and they reach another kingdom. The horse gives the prince some of its hairs and advises the boy to find work in the city. The prince disguises himself as a poor beggar and finds shelter with a poor old woman. The king of this city has seven daughters, and arranges a suitor selection test: the princesses are to release hawks at random, and they shall marry whoever the birds land next to. The prince, in his beggar disguise, goes to the ceremony, and the youngest princess's hawk lands near him. The king marries his seventh daughter to the beggar, much to his disgust, and expels her to a shabby hut. Later, the king becomes blind, and only some meat can cure him. The king's sons-in-laws go on a hunt, while the prince rides behind them. At a distance, he takes off the lousy disguise, puts on regal clothes and builds a tent, where he rests after getting more game than his brothers-in-law. He meets the king's other sons-in-law and agrees to share his game, in exchange for branding their rumps. Later, the kingdom goes to war, and the prince summons the merhorse, which he rides into battle to win the war in his father-in-law's favour. In his noble clothes, the prince then goes to meet the king and demands his six slaves, which are the other sons-in-law with marks on their bodies.Amanolahi, Sekandar; Thackston, Wheeler M.

 The Marine Colt 
In an Iranian tale titled ""كره اسب دريايي"" (, 'The Marine Colt'), prince Malek Ibrahim is doted on by his father, but hated by his stepmother. One day, a man brings the prince a horse from the sea which is fed with sweets. Later, Malek Ibrahim finds his horse friend in tears, and the animal explains the queen wishes to give him poisoned food. With the horse's warning, he avoids the food, despite his stepmother's trick during the meal. The next time, a hole was dug out and filled with a spear and a blade and covered with a carpet, which the prince jumps over to avoid the new trap. The third time, the horse predicts the queen will aim for the animal next while the prince is at school, so the animal will neigh three times to warn him. The next morning, the queen feigns illness and bribes a doctor to prescribe the liver of a marine horse as cure. The king's ministers try to look for a marine horse, until eventually one suggests they sacrifice the prince's pet horse.

The next day, Malek Ibrahim goes to school and hears his horse's neighing, throws ashes at his teacher's eyes and coins to the other students to create a distraction - just as the horse instructed him to do -, and rushes back home. The prince confronts his father about the killing his horse friend, and asks for one last ride on the animal, with his finest garments on, a saddle, an armor and some money in a khurjin. The king allows it; the prince gallops twice around the garden, jumps over the people and flies away to another place. While the prince is away, the king divorces his wife, punishes his minister and mourns for his son. After prince and horse land near the garden of another king, the animal advises the prince to trade clothes with a shepherd, buy a sheep and use its skin on his head, and find work with the king as his gardener. The horse also gives him some of its hairs to summon it, then departs.

It happens thus. One day, he summons his horse on a summer's day for a ride around the garden - an event witnessed by the king's youngest daughter from her room, where she also discusses with her elder sisters their marriage plans. Thus, they send for a servant to bring three melons to the king, which his minister explains are an analogy for their marriageability. The king then assembles a crowd of eligible suitors in front of the palace, each holding a golden orange near their chest for the princesses to shoot arrows at: the elder shoots to a minister's son, the middle one to the son of a man of law, while the youngest stays her hand, since her suitor is absent. The king then orders his guards to bring any male they find: the lowly gardener's assistant is forcibly brought, despite some initial refusal, and the youngest princess shoots her arrow at his orange. He questions the reason for such an action, and is told he was chosen as the princess's suitor. The youth does not wish to be married, but the king weds him to his daughter, and has them move out to a shed, while he marries the elder two in a seven-day and seven-night celebration.

Time passes; the king falls ill, and the doctors prescribe gazelle meat as cure. The king's sons-in-law ride to a hunt, and the youngest princess convinces her lowly husband to join them. He is given an old horse and a weapon, but, out of sight, summons his loyal horse and requests it to round up all deers in a fence, place a predator to guard them, and erect a tent. It happens thus. Meanwhile, his brothers-in-law meet a farmer, who tells them the ""king of animals"" fenced the deers in, and placed tigers, lions and wild animals around it. The brothers-in-law ride up the hill and meet Malek Ibrahim, who they do not recognize as the gardener, and ask for some deer meat. Malek Ibrahim agrees to a deal: first, they have to be branded on their feet with Malek Ibrahim's royal seal; then, they can have a carcass for themselves, but its head belongs to Malek Ibrahim. The men agree to a deal, and bring the meat to the king, who eats it, but his health does not improve. Later, Malek Ibrahim returns home, puts on the poor man's disguise, and gives his wife the deer head to prepare a dish for the king. The king eats the dish and restores his health.

Finally, war breaks out against an enemy king. The enemy army reaches the kingdom's gates, and Malek Ibrahim summons his horse again, this time to fight to protect his father-in-law's realm. He vanquishes his enemies, then goes to meet the king, his father-in-law, in search of his two runaway slaves. The prince points to his brothers-in-law, to the king's astonishment, and they show their branded feet. Malek Ibrahim bursts in laughter, and tells the king he is the son of the king of Iran. The youngest princess knew of his true identity, and married him anyway, despite his lowly disguise. Malek Ibrahim brings his wife home to his father in Iran.حميد سفيدگر شهانقي [Hamid Sefidgar Shahanghi]. ""جشن شب يلدا در ايران"" [ Yaldā Night celebration in Iran].

 The Peerless Knight and the Fairy-Horse 
Researcher Adrienne Boulvin collected an Iranian tale from Khorasan. In this tale, titled Le Cavalier Nonpareil et le Cheval-Fée (""The Peerless Knight and the Fairy-Horse""), the widowed governor of a village near Balkh marries another woman. However, the woman begins to hate her stepson, since her husband loves him, to her jealousy, and makes the domestic situation unbearable. Due to this, the boy resorts to hunting as a pastime and, one day, spots a horse and its foal munching on some herbs in a meadow, when a lion appears to attack the animals. The mare jumps in the ocean and abandons its young (which the tale says it is a ""poulain-marin"", a 'sea colt'), which is saved by the youth and brought to his home to be nursed. The youth's stepmother learns of his adventure and knows the horse is magical, able to remove all sorts of problems, so she plots to kill it: she feigns illness and convinces the village doctors to prescribe the heart of the fairy-horse as a cure. The woman's husband falls for the deception and prepares to kill his son's horse. The youth goes to say goodbye to his pet horse, which is told the situation. The horse then bids the youth ask for a last ride on the horse around the house before the execution, then the horse will take flight with him. It happens thus, and, during their flight, the youth shouts at his father the stepmother dyed her skin with curcuma to appear ill.

After their aerial escape, the horse lands near a green city and gives some of its hairs for the youth to burn and summon it. The youth ties his fine garments on the horse, puts on a shabby vest and goes to a garden to pick some fruits. The Shah's gardener finds the youth and adopts him as his son and apprentice. The youth learns his trade and works until the season when the roses are in bloom, and fashions beautiful bouquets. The old gardener brings the bouquets for the Shah's three daughters, who notice they are different from previous years. The youngest princess then decides to spy on the garden: she sees the youth taking a bath in a lake and throws him an apple. The youth sees her and falls in love. The youngest princess comments with her elder sisters about their future marriages, and sends their father three green melons, which the Shah interprets correctly: it is time to marry the princesses. So he orders for eligible suitors to assemble at the grand square for the princesses to choose their husbands by throwing bitter oranges ('oranges amères', in the original) to their suitors of choice. The elder throws hers to a vizier's son and the middle one for a vakil's son, but the youngest withholds hers. Noticing his cadette's reaction, the Shah orders the guards to bring in everyone that is absent, and they find gardener's assistant and bring him to the square. The youngest princess throws her orange to the lowly youth, and they marry, despite the Shah's sadness.

Later, the Shah summons his three sons-in-law for a hunt. The vizir's son and the vakil's son insult the gardener's son and ride ahead of him to the hunting ground. The youth then summons his fairy-horse and asks it to gather the animals for himself and set up a tent. His brothers-in-law find nothing and ride until they find the tent and several animals roaming about. They ask the tent's occupant, a man with a mask, if he can sell some of his game. The masked one agrees, as long as they agree to be branded on their backs with a seal. They make a deal, and the masked one prepares the carcasses, but, first, he chants as spell over the meat - as instructed by the fairy-horse - to remove the meat's flavour, and keeps the heads for himself. The two sons-in-law invite the Shah for dinner in their respective palaces to eat the animals they hunted, but the meat is tasteless and smells bad. The Shah then pays a visit to his gardener son-in-law and eats the dish with relish, and decides to gift him a palace.

Some time later, war breaks out, and the Shah's forces cannot defeat the enemies, until a masked youth appears on the battlefield to turn the tide of the battle. The Shah orders the masked man to be brought before him so he can be properly rewarded. The masked one says he wants nothing save for his two runaway slaves, branded with a mark on their backs. The king orders his sons-in-law to show their bodies, and there are marks on them. The masked one then reveals himself as the gardener's son, and retells his whole story, and asks if he can bring his wife with him to his father's village. The Shah agrees, and the youth rides back to his village with his retinue, where he is welcomed by his father and friends.Boulvin, Adrienne. Contes populaires persans de Khorassan Band 1.

 The Black Foal (Khosravi) 
In a tale collected by researcher Hossein Khosravi with the title ""کره اسب‌ سیاه"" (""Black Horse Foal""), a poor couple have a son named Murad. The boy is but a baby when his mother dies and his father remarries, having two sons with his new wife. Murad excels at school, to their step-family's great jealousy. One day, he and his brothers are fishing, and Murad fetches from the sea a large black foal, which he brings home to be his friend. His half-brothers grow increasingly jealous and demand their mother gives them the horse, so the woman plots to get rid of Murad: first, she tries to poison his rice dish, but Murad is alerted by the horse and avoids the food. Next, they dig up a hole on the ground, place blades and spears inside it, cover it and bid Murad sit at that spot. However, Murad is once again alerted by his pet horse and avoids siting on it, letting one of his half-brothers die in his place. Suffering for the loss of one of her sons, the stepmother feigns illness and bribes some doctors to prescribe the meat of the black foal as cure for her. Murad's father falls for his wife's trick and decides to sacrifice the horse the next day. Meanwhile, Murad and the horse discuss the animal's impending sacrifice and plot their own plan: the foal will neigh three times while Murad is at school; he is to rush back home and ask his father for one last ride on the horse. The next day, their plan works thus, and Murad asks his father to spare the horse for one last ride around. The man agrees; the duo ride some laps, then jump over a pole and gallop nonstop for seven days and nights, until they reach a walled garden. Inside, a king is being entertained by some people on a carpet. The foal tells Murad to find work in the garden, and says it will return to the sea, but gives the boy some of its hairs to summon it by burning them, then departs.

Murad buys a sheep's rumen and places it on his head as to appear bald, and enters the garden to ask for a job. The king and his guests look at him with strangeness, but the young princess, who is there with them, knows the boy is not bald, since she saw him on the black horse, and convinces her father to hire him. It happens thus. Some time later, the king announces his three daughters are to be married, and nobles and princes flock to the palace so the girls can choose their husbands by giving them bergamots. The elder two princesses choose sons of ministers, but the youngest cannot see the gardener and withholds her fruit. The king sends the guards to bring every men in the kingdom to the assemblage. They bring the bald gardener, to whom the third princess gives the fruit - to the king's outrage, who banishes her from his palace to live with the poor gardener in his hut. Later, the king falls ill, and the royal doctors prescribe the meat of a very rare breed of game as remedy. The ministers' sons ride into the wilderness to hunt for the king, while Murad is given a lame mount and a broken bow. He then summons his foal and asks it to round up all the game there is and set up a tent for them. It happens thus. Back to the ministers' sons, they cannot hunt any game and are ready to return empty-handed to the palace, until they see a tent and go to investigate. They see Murad, whom they do not recognize, and ask for some of the meat the latter has. Murad agrees to a deal: the meat in exchange or being branded on their backs. The brothers-in-law make the deal, believing no one will be aware of the exchange, while Murad separates some carcasses, uttering over them for the taste to go to the heads, not to the bodies.

The ministers' sons are given the game and invite the king to partake of a meal they prepared. The king goes to their palaces and eats a tasteless dish, then goes to his youngest daughter's hut and eats the head dish. He then complains that there is straw in his food, and moves them out to the palace kitchen. The same events happen again, but this time the king complains about the smell of smoke, and decides to have them move out to a cottage in the corner of the royal gardens. The third time, the king eats the tasty meal the third princess prepared, despite finding some fallen leaves on the plate, and declares they should move back to the palace the next day. After the king leaves, Murad summons the horse and requests for a large palace to be built overnight. The next morning, the king and his court take notice of the strange palace and decide to enter it. The king sees Murad, whom he does not recognize, and the boy reveals he is the king's son-in-law, disguised as Murad Kechal, the bald gardener. He also explains he brought him the meat his brothers-in-law claim to have hunted, and the ministers' sons hang their heads in shame, confirming the tale. The king then asks Murad to forgive him for the mistreatment and offers to make him king, but Murad chooses to be his minister.خسروی ,حسین [Khosravi, Hossein]; سمند, على [Asmand, Ali].

 Black Colt (Lori province) 
In an Iranian tale titled ""کرّة سیاه"" (""Black Colt""), sourced from Lori province, a king has two wives and no children. A man named Sayyid meets him and gives him an apple, to be given to the two co-queens. The king follows Sayyid's instructions, but the first wife eats half, while the other half is eaten by a sheep. Some time later, the sheep gives birth to a boy, whom the king takes to the first queen to raise and names him Ali Mishza. After the first queen dies, Ali Mishza discovers that a mare goes to foal near the sea, and, on one occasion, trails behind the mare to rescue its next foal from the sea. The boy takes the foal, of a black fur, to raise. Years pass, and Ali Mishza turns into a handsome youth that the king's second wife falls in love with, but he rejects her advances. Spurned, the second queen tries to destroy her step-son with the help of a seven-headed monster, but the black foal warns him of the dangers. Realizing that the foal is protecting the boy, she feigns illness and asks for the meat of the black foal as cure. The king is ready to sacrifice the horse to fulfill the queen's request, but Ali Mishza asks for a last ride on the animal around the palace. The plan works: Ali Mishza and the black foal fly away beyond the sea to another country, the foal gives a tuft of its mane to the boy, then gallops away. Ali Mishza goes to a nearby city, where he finds work as a cowherd. One day, he summons the black foal by burning its hairs and ride around, an event witnessed by the king's youngest daughter, who falls in love with him. Some time later, the king summons his seven daughters and prepares a suitor selection test: eligible suitors are to gather, and the princesses are to give an apple to their husband of choice. The youngest princess gives her apple to Ali Mishza, to the king's horror, who banishes his daughter to live a lowly life with the youth. Despite the mocking the youngest princess and Ali Miszha suffer, the youth proves his worth and inherits the kingdom from his father-in-law.Zarrin Taj Varedi, Mahmood Rezai Dashtarjene, Soodabe Keshavarzi.

 Del Del (Qoshan) 
In an Iranian tale collected from a source in Qoshan with the title ""دل دل"" (""Del Del""), the prince finds a mare, which the Al-khun explains can give birth to a ""Dil Dil"", but everytime she foals she throws her colt in the sea. The Al-khun tells the prince to help him restrain the mare the next time it gives birth, so he can have the foal on land with him. It happens thus, and the mare gives birth to a foal, which the prince Abdullah is instructed to feed on raisins for six months before he can ride the animal. His brothers, who ride around on their own horses, invite Abdullah to join them, but the youth's mount is not yet ready. His brothers realize the foal is of rare stock, from Del Del, and they wish to kill their sibling and have the animal for themselves. One day, he meets up with Del Del and finds it crying; the foal alerts him his brothers have dug up a hole for him to fall in, but he can simply jump over it. He does that. Realizing they cannot have the foal, the princes' mother rubs saffron on her face, feigns illness and asks for the meat of the foal. Abdullah meets with Del Del again, this time the horse warns they plan to kill it. Prince Abdullah meets his father and complains that his brothers ride their horses every day, so he should ride Del Del at least once. The king indulges his son, and both the prince and the animal escape into the desert, away from the kingdom. They climb up a mountain, then stop to rest and eat. Del Del advises the prince to wash his hair in a waterfall of golden water, which gilds his hair, then they make their way to a flock of sheep. The prince buys a sheep's stomach to wear as a cap, Del Del gives him some of its hairs, to be burnt in case he needs its help, and they part ways. Abdullah makes way to a city where he finds work with an old man, who is the royal gardener. The gardener prepares bouquets for the king's three daughters every day, and one day Abdullah asks him about it. The man answers him. Abdullah takes the chance to tease a sheep to distract the gardener, while he ties a strand of his golden hair in one of the bouquets. The three princesses are given the bouquets, but the third princess notices the golden strand and keeps the one that has it for herself. Some time later, she goes to the roof of the palace and spies on the gardener's assistant without his cap, and swoons at the sight. Her maidservants go to help her. Some days later, the princesses send melons to their father as analogy to their marriageability, which they explain to the king. The monarch then gathers all eligible suitors for the princesses to choose their husbands by grabbing their hands: the elder chooses the minister's son and the middle one the attorney's son, while the youngest remains still. The king then orders everyone to be brought to the ceremony; the soldiers find Abdullah in the desert and bring him. The third princess holds his hand, to her father and sisters' horror. The king gives palaces for his elder daughters, and banishes the cadette to the stables. Later the king's sons-in-law go on a hunt, and so does Abdullah: the prince summons Del Del by burning its hair, and they set up a tent atop a mountain, where many animals flock to them. The brothers-in-law sight the tent and go up the mountain, meeting Abdullah, whom they do not recognize. They complain to the stranger they could not find any game, and Abdullah offers them some under one condition: to be branded with a burning coin on their feet. A deal is made, and the brothers-in-law take some sheep for their wives to cook for the king. The elder princesses' dishes are tasteless, causing the king to expel both from the palace, while the youngest's meal, made with heads and hooves, is tasty to the monarch and his wife. Later, a foreign king sends a letter demanding one of the princesses in marriage to his son, and, on being refused, declares war. The conflict lasts for three days, and Abdullah, on the third day, joins in the fray, killing the enemy army, then returning to his wife, who wraps up a strip of her clothes around his wound. The king, his father-in-law, realizes Abdullah is his gardener son-in-law and nominates him as his successor, but he has first to choose a minister and an attorney. Abdullah says he has already done it, and the other two sons-in-law show their branded soles. Abdullah then makes his brothers- and sisters-in-law his servants.

 Balochistan 
In a Balochi tale collected by Iranist Ivan Zarubin and published with the title ""О кознях мачехи и приключениях царевича"" (""About the stepmother's intrigue and the prince's adventures""), a king has three sons, two by a first wife, and a third by a second (deceased) wife. One day, the king gives fine horses to the elder two and an old one to the youngest. The youngest's horse goes to foal near the water and someone pulls its legs from inside the water, while the third prince pulls from the other side. The person ceases their action, and recommends the prince feeds the foal with black sheep's milk. Later, the king's first wife plans to kill her step-son: first by giving him poisoned bread, then digs up a hole and covers with a carpet. With the foal's help, the prince avoids both dangers. Lastly, she feigns illness and asks for meat of the foal of a water horse. The foal warns the prince and both hatch a plan: the horse will whinny eight times to alert him; he is to come and ask for a last ride on it, then they must make their escape. The next day, the king plans the horse's execution, and everything happens according to their plan: the prince flies away with the horse, and leaves a letter telling the king of the step-mother's plan. During the journey, the prince helps a female div and gains some of her hairs to summon her and her family in the hour of need. Next, the prince kills a snake to protect a nest of Simurgh chicks, and gains some feathers. Finally, he buys some sheep skin to use as a cap, and finds work under the royal gardener. The next day, while the princesses are away bathing, the prince summons his loyal foal and rides around the garden. He rests to comb his hair with a golden comb, and notices the princesses are returning, he barely has time to hide the comb and dismiss the horse, and the youngest princess takes notice of this. Some days later, the princesses send melons to their father as analogy for their marriageability, and the king sends for every available suitor to a selection: the princesses are to release pigeons at random; whoever the birds land on, they shall marry. The youngest's pigeon lands on the gardener's apprentice. She repeats the action twice more, which confirms her choice of a husband. The king marries his three daughters and places the elder two in good palaces, while the young goes to live with the gardener in a donkey stable. Later, the king sends his sons-in-law to hunt some gazelles as game. The boy summons the horse and gathers all gazelles in the forest to his tent. His brothers-in-law come to meet him, whom they don't recognize, and, seeing the animals around him, ask for a piece. The prince agrees, as long as they allow to be branded with slave marks on their feet. Next, war erupts, and the king leads the army to war. The prince rides his loyal horse and, with the help of the divs and the Simurgh, defeats the enemies. When he is hurt, the king bandages his injuries with a handkerchief, then returns to the donkey stables. The war over, the princess recognizes her father's handkerchief on the gardener's hand, then goes to tell her father. The next morning, the prince awakes, summons the horse and orders a large golden palace to be built in front of his father-in-law's. The prince shows up in his true form and reveals the slave marks on his brothers-in-law, thus confirming his story. The king then makes him his successor.Зарубин, Иван Иванович.

In a text collected in the Koroshi dialect with the title Šāhay Bač, translated as The King's Son, a king has a wife and son. After she dies, he marries another woman of perfidious character, for she wants to kill the prince and inherit her husband's estate. The prince has a horse that, everytime it foals, it tosses its young to the sea. One day, the prince questions the animal about it, and the horse answers no one can raise its foal, but the prince says he will do it. The horse then advises the prince how to feed the next foal: with the meat of seven goats and the milk of a black goat with no white spot on its body, and the prince raises the foal accordingly. Back to the queen, she puts her plans into motion: first, she puts poison in his food; next, she digs up a hole, fills it with swords and spears and covers it with a carpet, for the prince to fall in when he sits to eat. Each time when the prince comes back from school and goes to meet the foal, it warns him of the danger, thus he escapes. The queen complains to someone about killing the prince, and they suggest she should kill the animal first, for it is the foal that is warning him. Thus, she feigns illness (jaundice) and asks for horse-blood as remedy. The king falls for her trick, and decides to sacrifice his son's pet foal. The prince does not consent to it, so the king decides to kill it while his son is at school. The foal discovers the plan and plots with the prince: it will neigh three times to warn him. The next morning, the horse neighs twice, and the prince throws candies to distract his schoolmates and then throws salt at their eyes to deter them, while he rushes back home. He stops the execution and asks the king for a ride on the foal. The king allows it, and the prince jumps over the soldiers and gallops away. The duo reach a city, the foal gives the prince some of its hairs, while the prince finds a shepherd, trades clothes with him and places a sheep's rumen on his head to appear bald. He goes to work for a gardener as his assistant. The garden belongs to the king, and one day the monarch and his seven daughters come to relax in the garden. The tale then explains the prince rides with his princely garments on the foal, which the seventh princess witnesses. The princess also admires his beauty, and in another occasion spies on his bathing time, taking an interest in him. Some time later, the minister tells the king it is past time to marry the princesses, and they gather all suitable young men, and the princesses shall choose their husbands from the crowd by using an apple. The six elder princesses choose their husbands, but the youngest withholds her apple, for her suitor, Hasan the Bald (hasan ka'čal, in the original text), is not there. The king orders the gardener's assistant to be brought there, and the princess throws her apple to him, hitting her chest. Thinking his daughter made a mistake, the king asks her to repeat the action, and still she chooses Hasan. The king agrees to their marriage, but banises her to live in the desert in their own hut. It happens thus, and Hasan spends the days grazing the king's donkeys and horses. One day, the king orders his six sons-in-law to hunt some prey, and they ride with guns and horses. The youngest princess convinces her husband, Hasan the Bald, to join them. Hasan is then given a lame mount, but, out of sight, he burns his foal's hairs to summon it, asking the animal to neigh and summon every prey in the mountains near them, while he sets up a tent. The foal does as asked, and every animal gathers near him, leaving his brothers-in-law empty-handed. The six brothers-in-law arrive at the prince's tent, whom they do not recognize, and ask for some. The prince makes a deal: he will give some of his game in exchange for them allowing the prince to leave a mark on their shoulders with the animal's blood. As the prince slays the animals and marks the other hunts, he keeps muttering to himself over the cacasses for the taste to be at the head. The deal done, they part ways. The six brothers-in-law bring home tasteless meat, which the princesses use for insipid meals, while the youngest princess cooks a tasty dish of head and trotters. While the youngest princess brings her father her dish, she is mocked by her elder sisters, then goes back to her husband, confiding in him that she knows his identity and requesting he reveals it to end their mockery. The prince then summons his foal once again, and requests a palace to be built greater than the king's. The next morning, when the muezzin goes for the morning call for the prayers, he sights the newly built palace and alerts the king. The king and his ministers visit the palace and meet the bald gardener, who has come after his six servants whose bodies have been branded. The king sends for the slaves, and discovers they are his six sons-in-law and their wives. The gardener then explains he is a prince who married the youngest princess, and their brothers- and sisters-in-law become their servants.Nourzaei, M., Jahani, C., Anonby, E., and Ahangar, A. A.

In a Turkmen tale translated as ""Шахзаде и ею жеребенок"" (""Shahzade and his Foal""), a padishah has two wives and a son by the first one. One day, his first wife dies, and the padishah sends his son to herd the horses by the beach. Suddenly, a horse comes out the sea and mates with one of the mares. Months later, a foal is born to the mare. The padishah gets his son out of the horse herd task and places him with a mullah to learn. His father also wants to gift him with one of the horses, and he chooses the foal that the sea horse sired. Years later, the padishah's second wife gives birth to a son, and he celebrates with a seven-day feast. The boy, named Shahzade, goes to the mullah and returns to groom his horse. He notices the horse is crying, and asks it the reason. The horse answers that the boy's step-mother plans to kill him with poisoned food. Heeding his warning, he does not eat the food. In another occasion, the step-mother digs up a hole in their yurt, fills it with spears and covers it. The horse warns him again and he avoid the pitfall, only for his half-brother to fall into the trap. The third time, the step-mother pretends to be ill and says her only cure is the heart of a black-tongued horse. The padishah orders the horse's sacrifice. The day before, the horse conspires with the boy that it will whinny three times to call his attention, and he should tell his father he wants a last ride on the horse. The next day, it happens as the horse planned, Shahzade rides the animal to another city and establishes himself there, as the tale ends.""Проданный сон: туркменские народные сказки"" [Turkmen Folk Tales].

 Bashkir people 
In a tale from the Bashkirs translated into Russian language as ""Златохвостый-Серебряногривый"" (""Golden-Tailed, Silver-Maned""), an old couple live in poverty with their two daughters and a son named Кыдрас (Kydras), until one day they die and leave the siblings orphaned. Kydras finds work as a donkey keeper for a bai and takes the donkey for a bath in the river. He earns some money, but is sacked, and has to look for another job. After going through the forest and scaring away some wolves by setting fire to a haystack, he finally reaches another village, where he finds work as a horse keeper for another bai. The second bai has 34 mares and 6 stallions, but one of the mares, Юндузкашка (Yunduzkashka), sometimes disappears at night to foal somewhere. The bai makes an agreement with Kydras: if the boy can find out where the mare foals, he can get of its colts. During the first three nights, Kydras watches over Yunduzkashka, but on the fourth the boy falls asleep and the mare escapes to the Aral Sea to foal. The next round of nights, Kydras manages to follow the runaway mare to the sea and spies on its foaling in the sea. Kydras manages to rescue a silver-maned, golden-tailed colt and bring it back to the bai. After three years, the colt becomes a fine stallion. However, the bai's wife falls ill and asks for the stallion's ribmeat as cure. Kydras pays a visit to the stallion in the stables to mourn over its potential death, and the horse begins to talk to the boy: since Kydras was the one that groomed and fed it, he can be the one to save it; it will neigh three times near the time of execution to alert him, and Kydras is to beg the bai for one last ride on the horse. After the evening prayers, Kydras follows the horse's plan and both ride away from the village and deep within the forest. At a safe distance, the horse gives Kydras some of its tail hairs, which can summon it if the youth needs its help, and gallops away. Kydras goes to a nearby house where an old couple lives; the old man is to bring apples to the three princesses. Kydras offers to go in his stead and takes the apples to the princesses: a rotten one for the eldest, a semi-rotten for the middle one, and a ripe for the youngest. The king thinks the presents are an outrage and sends for Kydras. The youth goes to the king's presence and explains that the apples represent their marriageability. Moved by the words, the king then sets a suitor selection test: the princesses will stand on a raised platform and throw their apples to their husbands of choice. The elder princess throws her to a soldier, the middle one to an officer, and the youngest to Kydras. Thinking his third daughter made a mistake, the king orders her to toss her apple again, and it still falls on Kydras's lot. Resigned, the king gives his elder daughters ivory palaces, and moves his youngest to an old hut. Later, the king falls ill, and only meat from the rib of a long-lived, 101-years-old owl can cure him. Kydras is given a lame horse to venture through the woods, but he summons the silver-maned, golden-tailed stallion and hunts the owl before his brothers-in-law. He cuts off the owls ribs, and waits for his brother-in-law. The duo see that Kydras got the owl and ask for its carcass; the youth agrees to trade for it, in exchange for Kydras cutting off some slices of flesh from the back of one of them. Kydras gives the wrong rib to the brothers-in-law, but saves the correct one for himself to give to the king. Later, the king needs the rib of another owl, this time from a 107-years-old one. Kydras finds the owl first, and, once again, his brothers-in-law come to the forest and ask for a share. Kydras agrees to the deal, in exchange for branding the back of the other brother-in-law. Later, Kydras tells his wife he will go away for three months. He returns three months later with a new disguise: a fine knight mounted on the silver-maned, golden-tailed stallion. He jumps over the palace gates and meets the king, demanding his two soldiers: one with slices of flesh cut from his back, and the other with the branded back. The king, Kydras's father-in-law, sends for his two sons-in-law to placate the stranger. The third princess comes in and begs for her father. Kydras takes off his disguise and they recognize him."""". Tom 4: Волшебные сказки. Сказки о животных [Vol. 4: Tales of Magic and Animal Tales]. Сост. Н.Т. Зарипов. Вступ. ст., коммент. Л.Г.

397,7284,75175467,7203,Eilifdahlia,"Eilifdahlia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Teloschistaceae. It contains three species of corticolous (bark-dwelling), crustose lichens that occur in the Southern Hemisphere.

Taxonomy
The genus was circumscribed in 2014 by lichenologists Sergey Kondratyuk, Ingvar Kärnefelt, John Alan Elix, Arne Thell, and Jae-Seoun Hur, following a molecular phylogenetics-led restructuring of the subfamily Caloplacoideae. They assigned Eilifdahlia dahlii as the type species; this species was formerly classified in the genus Caloplaca. The genus name honours Norwegian lichenologist 
Eilif Dahl for his ""important contributions to the Australian lichen flora"". Two species were included in the initial circumscription of the genus; a third was added in 2017.

Description

The crust-like thallus of Eilifdahlia has a continuous to patchy appearance, typically ranging in colour from white to greyish white. Its surface layer is organized in a cellular structure known as . The apothecia are  in form and are encased in an outer layer, the , that is either paraplectenchymatous or . Each ascus produces eight spores, which are . The lichen also produces rod-shaped or slightly elongated rod-shaped conidia. In terms of chemical properties, the thallus does not change colour when exposed to the potassium hydroxide (K) spot test, but the apothecia turn purple. Lichen products in the genus include the dominant presence of lichexanthone and anthraquinones linked to the parietin group (or ), with these compounds being most concentrated in the apothecia.

Species
, Species Fungorum (in the Catalogue of Life) accepts three species of Eilifdahlia:
 Eilifdahlia dahlii  – Australia
 Eilifdahlia sergeyana  – South Australia
 Eilifdahlia wirthii  – South Africa

The proposed taxon Eilifdahlia schwarzii  has since been transferred to Caloplaca as Caloplaca schwarzii.",2024-01-06,"['Teloschistales' 'Teloschistales genera' 'Lichen genera'

He succeeded his father as Count of Mons in 1013. He married Mathilde of Verdun, daughter of Herman, Count of Verdun and his wife Mathilde.

He also acquired the southern part of the Brabant province around 1024.

He was succeeded as Count of Mons by his son Herman, who was married to Richilde, Countess of Mons and Hainaut. Upon the death of Herman, control of the county passed to Richilde's second husband, Baldwin VI, Count of Flanders.",2025-02-07,"['990s births' '1039 deaths' 'House of Reginar' 'Counts of Mons'

Biography
M'Dowall was born at Maxwelltown, Kirkcudbrightshire, 21 July 1815, was son of a traveller for a cabinet-making firm. Receiving a good school education in Dumfries, he learned bookbinding there, and enlarged his experience in Glasgow and London. 1843, on becoming a free churchman, he was appointed to the editorial staff of the ‘Scottish Herald,’ an Edinburgh free church paper, and was afterwards for a short time reporter on the ‘Banner of Ulster.’ In 1846 he became editor of the Dumfries and Galloway Standard, and with a short interval, during which he edited a Sunderland paper, about 1853–4, M'Dowall conducted the ‘Galloway Standard’ till his death, raising it to an influential position. A public-spirited citizen, he was connected with all the leading institutions of his burgh, and in his ‘History of Dumfries,’ 1867 (enlarged in 1873), he produced a most valuable record. He died at Dumfries, 28 October 1888. He was twice married, and his second wife survives him.

M'Dowall displays grace of fancy and expression in ‘The Man of the Woods and other Poems,’ published in 1844, 2nd edit. 1882. Two chapters of his ‘History of Dumfries,’ relating to Burns, were separately issued in 1870 as ‘Burns in Dumfriesshire.’ In 1876, he published ‘Memorials of St. Michael's Churchyard,’ a compilation of antiquarian and biographical importance. His ‘Mind in the Face,’ which appeared in 1882, and reached a third edition in 1888, is a substantial contribution to the literature of physiognomy. M'Dowall's sumptuous and exhaustive volume, ‘Chronicles of Lincluden, as an Abbey and as a College,’ was published in 1886, and his last work, issued in 1888, is a study of ballad-writers, entitled ‘Among the Old Scottish Minstrels.’",2024-03-07,"['1815 births' '1888 deaths' 'Scottish antiquarians'

Frank Baum's 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The film was produced by Özdemir Birsel for Hisar (Citadel) Film. It is one of nearly forty films featuring Zeynep Değirmencioğlu as Ayşecik, many of which, like this one, were uncredited adaptations of famous stories, for example, Sinderella Külkedisi (Cinderella) (Süreyya Duru, 1971), Hayat Sevince Güzel [literally, ""Loving makes life beautiful""] (Pollyanna) (Temel Gürsu, 1971), and Pamuk Prenses ve 7 Cüceler (Snow White) (Ertem Göreç, 1970).

Plot summary
A little girl named Ayşecik lives with her parents on a farm, where they often feed the chickens or harvest crops. One day, however, there is a terrible tornado. She rushes back to the house because her dog is locked inside. But at that moment, strong winds blow the cottage off its foundation and into the sky.  When the house lands, she opens the front door and peeks outside. Given a protective kiss and a pair of silver shoes by the Northern Sorceress and promised aid by seven munchkins, she sets out to find the Great Wizard. Through the grasslands and forests, she encounters Korkuluk (the Scarecrow) and in the forest she meets Teneke Koruadam (the Tin Woodman), and Korkak Aslan (the Cowardly Lion). Keşkin Zeka demands that they kill the Wicked Witch (Kötü Cadı) of the South (Suna Selen) in order to receive their wishes. But Ayşecik and Korkak Aslan are imprisoned in the witch's jail-house after their friends are destroyed by her army of soldiers. Ayşecik comes into the jail-house, carrying a heavy, tin bucket but the sets it down as the wicked witch orders her to wash the floor. The girl trips over a string and her left shoe lands on the floor, the wicked witch picks up the shoe and teases Ayşecik. Ayesecik picks up her bucket of water and throws it at her, the witch screams as her servants run away but then she begins to tremble, then she finally evaporates into thin air. The witch's former subjects willingly restore Korkuluk and Teneke Koruadam. Back at the Emerald City, Keşkin Zeka admits to being a fraud, delivers trinkets to Ayşecik's friends, and accidentally leaves her behind in his balloon escape, so they set off on their journey again, meeting again the china dolls, the hammer-wielding cavemen (loosely based on Baum's Hammerheads) and then start to dance, then, after the Good Sorceress tells her how to use her shoes, Ayşecik bids farewell to her friends, clicks her heels, and ends up home. Interestingly, for the first time in any adaptation of The Wizard of Oz, we see the reaction of the young heroine's friends after she leaves.

Production
Zeynep Değirmencioğlu was 17 years old when she played Ayşecik, the same age as Judy Garland was when she played Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz (1939), which this film is based on. In the book, Dorothy is said to be between the ages of 10-12. 

The name of the leading character was changed from Dorothy to Ayşecik. This was to capitalize and cash in on Değirmencioğlu's status in Turkish pop culture with her signature and title role of Ayşecik in the Ayşecik film franchise. Throughout her career, Değirmencioğlu was often type cast in this girl next door mold and often played the character of Ayşecik in different prototypes. 

Ayşe's dogs name is Boncuk (changed from Toto), which is a very common name for pets in Turkey. The name itself means ""bead"" in Turkish. Over the years, English speaking audiences misinterpreted his name as ""Banju"".",2024-12-06,"['1971 films' 'Turkish fantasy films'

Websites that have been removed by the Interstate Broadcasting Agreement (RStV) do not have to be deleted but are no longer publicly accessible.

 Concept 
Depublizieren is a neologism from the word publication (publish, from Latin publicus, public) and the Latin prefix de- (""off"", "" gone"", ""down"", ""miss""). The term, which is not used on a legal basis, was hardly used before 2010. Earlier definitions of depublizieren as ""unpublishing"" referred to the removal of factually incorrect content from the Internet without comment instead of correctionWas ist… Lexikon: Depublizieren. In: drweb.de, June 20, 2004, retrieved on September 15, 2010: ""Do you know the term 'depublish'? You could also say 'unpublish', but that doesn't sound very elegant. What is meant is that reports, news or articles that were obviously false, lies or fabrications are not supplemented by a correction, as one would do in a newspaper, they simply disappear, are deleted and erased from the web."" or, as a technical term, to the withdrawal of a contribution visible on a website without its deletion from the repository.Federal Office of Administration: Erstellung eines Workflowkonzeptes (Published by the Federal Office for Information Technology, August 6, 2004, retrieved on September 15, 2010 (PDF; 590 kB), p. 38. Technically, the latter meaning corresponds to using the term in the discussion about depublishing public Internet content.

The formation of the term contains a paradoxical element, as the terms ""publishing"" or "" publicizing"" do not actually permit this form of formation of antonyms:Cf. depublizieren. In: Neusprech.org, September 12, 2010, retrieved on September 16, 2010. a statement made to the public by publication cannot be retracted by not continuing to disseminate it, but only by revocating it. Therefore, a person harmed by untrue media reports can regularly assert a claim for a right of reply or rectification (→ right to rectification).

However, such a corrective revocation is not meant when depublishing public service content. The use of the term by the employees and committees of public broadcasters responsible for the organization of depublizieren made the term a buzzword in the summer of 2010, which, due to its contradictory nature, tends to criticize the removal of websites (→ Reactions section). What is published on the internet cannot be taken back; this is conceptually ""silly"" and a ""fight against windmills"" (Johnny Haeusler).Maik Gizinski: Der Kampf der Netzaktivisten gegen das Depublizieren.

 Previous history 

In 2003, the German Association of Private Broadcasters and Telemedia (VPRT) filed a complaint with the European Commission, describing the broadcast receiving license as illegal state aid under Article

paragraph 1 of the Treaty of Rome (EGV) - now Article 107 paragraph 1 of the TFEU Treaty. This funding distorts competition and puts private companies at a disadvantage, especially since public broadcasters do not have a narrowly defined functional mandate for their activities, especially in the online sector. Although the federal states and the broadcasters themselves had never considered the financing of the fees as a state subsidy, the EU Commission followed the VPRT's interpretation and demanded that this aid be abolished or that the exemption criteria of Article

paragraph 2 of the Treaty of Rome (EGV) be fulfilled.Thomas Mike Peters: Was ist eigentlich der Drei-Stufen-Test?. In: Telemedicus, February 16, 2009, retrieved on September 15, 2010. An open conflict arose in the summer of 2007:

However, Article 5 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany guarantees ""freedom of the press and freedom of reporting through broadcasting and film"", and although public service broadcasting is not explicitly mentioned there, this includes its reporting and press products. On September 11, 2007, the Federal Constitutional Court stated that the mandate of public service broadcasting also extends to new digital offerings and contains a ""development guarantee"" (already stated in earlier broadcasting rulings by the court). According to this, public service broadcasting is to ensure the diversity of offerings and the reliability of information on the internet - it is attributed a ""genuine online mandate"".BVerfG: Determination of broadcasting fees. BVerfG, judgment of the First Senate of September 11, 2007 - 1 BvR 2270/05, 1 BvR 809/06, 1 BvR 830/06 –, BVerfGE 119, 181; cf. BVerfG: 5th Broadcasting Decision / Baden-Württemberg. BVerfG, Decision of the First Senate of March 24, 1987 - 1 BvR 147, 478/86 –, BVerfGE 74, 297 and BVerfG: 8th broadcasting decision/cable fees: BVerfG, judgment of the First Senate of February 22, 1994, Ref.: 1 BvL 30/88, BVerfGE 90, 60. All in: Telemedicus.info, retrieved on September 15, 2010, and in BVerfGE. ""The Supreme Court's ruling on fees was seen as a victory for public service broadcasting.""

The State Aid Compromise of 2007 between the Federal Republic of Germany and the EU Commission stipulated that ""the functional mandate of the public broadcasters will be sufficiently specified"" by June 1, 2009, and in particular that its extension to online offerings will be defined. This compromise averted a case before the European Court of Justice, which could have ""called into question the financing of broadcasting in the entire EU"".

 Legal basis 

 Objective 
On June 1, 2009, the 12th Amendment to the Interstate Broadcasting Treaty (12th RÄStV) came into force, with which the federal states wanted to fulfill their obligations from the State Aid Compromise and at the same time secure the constitutionally guaranteed independence of the public media.

The 12th Interstate Broadcasting Treaty (RÄStV) should fully transfer the traditional mission of the public broadcasters to the online sector, as the ""density of households that are technically connected to the Internet and use Internet services""Begründung zum Zwölften Staatsvertrag zur Änderung rundfunkrechtlicher Staatsverträge. In: Institut für Urheber- und Medienrecht, retrieved on September 15, 2010. has increased considerably and the development guarantee confirmed by the Federal Constitutional Court requires this. To meet the requirements of the EU Commission, however, one aspect in particular must be taken into account:

 Broadcasting concept 
However, the 12th RÄStV also included a change to the definition of broadcasting. Section 2, paragraph 1, of the new RStV now states:

According to the explanatory memorandum of the 12th Interstate Broadcasting Treaty, the new aspect is ""the clarification that broadcasting is a linear information and communication service. The insertion of the criterion 'for simultaneous reception' distinguishes broadcasting services from on-demand services. Simultaneous reception is also to be understood as a transmission which is subject to short delays for technical reasons alone"". The linearity criterion excludes, for example, the independent presentation of user-generated content and the form of an online community.The SR pointed out that such ""possibilities of participation [...] are nowadays expected as a matter of course"" and justified them in terms of the RStV with the ""communicative necessity of the mutual exchange of opinions, experiences and information"" for Web 2.0 elements in public service Internet offerings, starting with the possibility for users to comment on articles. However, editorial control of user contributions remains a prerequisite for such offerings. Telemedienkonzept. SR-online.de. In: SR-online.de, April 9, 2010, p. 48f., downloaded on September 18, 2010 (PDF; 1.77 MB). The exclusion of on-demand offerings is the basis for the definition of dwell times for public Internet offerings (→ section Dwell times). Without the broad understanding of ""simultaneous"", which allows for short delays ""for technical reasons"", this redefinition would not allow public service content to be accessed over the Internet.

In the 12th version of the RStV, which has been in force since 2009, public broadcasters are no longer allowed to offer ""non-broadcast press-like offerings"" and ""comprehensive local reporting"" according to Section 11d.12th ""RÄStV"" This paragraph also includes an addendum with various forms of offerings that are not permitted for the online presence of public broadcasters, including, for example, file-sharing platforms, route planners, and classified ads.Rundfunkstaatsvertrag In: Institut für Urheber- und Medienrecht, retrieved on September 18, 2010.

 Dwell times 
On December 18, 2008, the state governments agreed in the 12th RÄStV that broadcasters may normally make program-related content available for seven days. According to Section 11d, Paragraph 2, RStV, exceptions apply, among other things, to soccer coverage of 1st and 2nd Bundesliga matches, which may only be available for 24 hours, and to archives ""with contemporary and cultural history content"", which may be online for an unlimited period.

According to the explanatory memorandum of the 12th RÄStV, ""the provision of contemporary and cultural history content in the form of Telemedia corresponds to the democratic, social and cultural needs of society"". The restriction of soccer coverage is justified with ""higher costs for the acquisition of additional rights"" for a longer on-demand option, which ""should be avoided in the interest of the license fee payers"".

To meet the requirements of the EU Commission about the specification of their functional mandate without interfering with their constitutional independence, the federal states prescribed the three-step test as a procedure for the public broadcasters to check the conformity of the offer with the mandate in each case. However, the decision on the continuation of old offers and the introduction of new concepts on the Internet and in broadcasting was left to the broadcasting bodies themselves, the Broadcasting Councils. These bodies also decide on the duration of online services.

 Procedure 

 Three-step test 
Accordingly, the competent Broadcasting Councils (Television Council, Radio Council) decide in a five-stage procedure whether or not an offer meets the three-stage test criteria, namely

If a Broadcasting Board determines that an offering is new or substantially changed and is neither already legally required nor already legally prohibited (Phase 1), it initiates the procedure (Phase 2) based on a specific description of the offering, the central element of which is the collection of information (Phase 3), on which the Broadcasting Board's decision, including the statement of reasons (Phase 4), and the final review by the responsible state government as the legal supervisor (Phase 5) are based.Manfred Kops, Karen Sokoll, Viola Bensinger: Rahmenbedingungen für die Durchführung des Drei-Stufen-Tests. Gutachten erstellt für den Rundfunkrat des Westdeutschen Rundfunks. In: Arbeitspapiere des Instituts für Rundfunkökonomie, Issue 252, Cologne/Berlin 2009 (PDF; 3.3 MB).

The information gathering phase includes, in particular, obtaining the views of competing suppliers and the views of independent experts on the impact of the proposed transaction on competition. Comments and economic data from private competitors (which are taken into account in the procedure but are not published) could, for example, state that ""offers already on the market will be completely crowded out"", which would affect the second three-step test criterion. However, according to the three-step test, the determination of the ""democratic, social and cultural needs of society"" and the quality of a service in terms of journalistic competition are also important elements in answering the question of whether or not a specific service falls within the remit of public service broadcasting. Only after all of this has been weighed against the costs of a service can a broadcasting council decide on the admissibility of an offer, justify its decision and pass it on to the respective state government responsible for legal supervision: The legal supervision checks compliance with the procedural rules, but does not make its assessment of the content (otherwise it would be a constitutionally inadmissible ""technical supervision"" in the broadcasting sector).ARD-Informationen zum Dreistufentest. Wieso, weshalb, warum – und wie: Was zum Dreistufentest zu wissen ist. In: ARD.de, 27. Mai 2009 (Memento from June 8, 2010 in the Internet Archive).

The results of the subsequent three-stage tests for the existing offerings were published in summer 2010. Saarland Broadcasting, among others, summarized the considerations on media use on which its dwell time concept was based:

Because of this distinction between two usage patterns, public broadcasters typically make a large portion of their online offerings available for seven days (lean-back approach) and another portion for a longer period, such as a year (lean-forward approach).

 Reactions 

Following the adoption of the 12th RÄStV, there were several media debates in 2009 and 2010 about the three-step tests and the resulting restrictions on public online offerings. Private media companies and publishers' associations were less critical of ZDF than of ARD, which is much more complexly organized with a total of 37 three-stage tests.Dieter Anschlag, Christian Bartels: ZDF. In: IInstitute for Media and Communication Policy (Ed.): Mediadatenbank mediadb.eu. August 10, 2010, retrieved on September 25, 2010. During this period, representatives of public and private media often met in panel discussions. The new legal regulations were criticized with combative terms such as ""Morgenthau Plan"" or ""censorship"", while private publishers often used the catchword ""electronic press"" for the online offerings of the broadcasters.

After the completion of the Telemedia concepts in the summer of 2010, the length of time that various television genres remained in the media libraries and the deletion of online contributions became much-discussed topics ""that arouse the ire of Internet users and are ostentatiously regretted by those responsible at the broadcasters. Like some ARD broadcasters, ZDF announced the removal of about 80 percent of its online content, which it estimated at 93,500 individual documents. ZDF director-general Markus Schächter said he hoped this would put an end to the debate about public broadcasters' online activities:

Some politicians are also critical of depublizieren, with the SPD in Saarland and the Pirate Party in BrandenburgRegierungsprogramm der SPD Saar 2012 - 2017.

Representatives of the governing coalition, however, only wanted the seven-day rule to be lifted for offerings that represent a ""qualitative added value"" compared to existing offerings from private providers.Enquete beendet Arbeit erfolgreich, on the website of the EIDG of the German Parliament from January 29, 2013, retrieved on February 6, 2013

 Biased reports 
When the first articles disappeared from their online offerings, the editorial teams of the public broadcasters were initially confronted with questions about the supposed deletion of websites. They used the term depublizieren to explain the process and to clarify the difference with the deletion of websites, and were confronted with critical opinions from the public, which had already been anticipated in public statements:Sadrozinski 2010-07-20

The coverage of the three-stage review process was so negative in the spring of 2010 that the Conference of Commission Chairmen of the Association of State Media Authorities felt compelled to complain about the poor quality of reporting.GVK-Vorsitzender fordert differenzierte Berichterstattung über Dreistufentest-Verfahren. In: ARD.de, 16. März 2010 (Memento from May 24, 2010 in the Internet Archive). Among other things, ""abbreviated, incorrect and one-sided"" reports were made from confidential documents, giving ""the impression that the committees are avoiding transparency in a quasi-autocratic and interest-driven manner. At the same time, however, the influence of lobbying by publishers and private broadcasters has already been pointed out, in whose interests the extensive curtailment of public service online activities is taking place, although they are not satisfied with the result.Diemut Roether: Kalter Medienkrieg. Wie der Drei-Stufen-Test instrumentalisiert wird. In: epd medien Nr. 13. Evangelischer Pressedienst, February 20, 2010, archived from the original on February 27, 2010; retrieved November 22, 2013. In the spring of 2010, media journalist Stefan Niggemeier drew attention to the conflict of interest between private media providers and public service media, which has led to biased reporting by both groups.Stefan Niggemeier: Das Elend der Debatte um ARD und ZDF. In: Stefan-Niggemeier.de, February 23, 2010, retrieved on September 15, 2010.

The most critical coverage of the depublizieren that began in the summer after the Telemedia concepts were decided on largely corresponded to the relationship of the depublizieren editors to their work, as Niggemeier made clear in one of the first newspaper reports entitled Depublizieren:

The public broadcasters' reporting therefore also expressed their dissatisfaction with the depublizieren process and referred to the broadcasters' legal obligation to do so.Staatsvertrag zwingt zum Löschen von Online-Inhalten.

Following accusations by the BDZV that the depublizieren of ARD online content did not go far enough and was, therefore, a farce, ARD Chairman Peter Boudgoust summarized that ARD had depublished more than one million Internet pages, including around 80 percent of the original pages of tagesschau.de. ARD had not wanted this procedure, but had ""complied with applicable law in its implementation"". Unfortunately, it was ""primarily the users who had to pay the price"".Peter Boudgoust: „Möchtegern-Skandal“. In: ARD.de, 20. Juli 2010 (Memento from July 22, 2010 in the Internet Archive). In July 2010, at the same time as the decision-making phase for the Telemedia concepts, the now defunct website www.depublizieren.de was created as a protest against depublizieren, containing a fictitious death notice for ""Die Publizierung"".Plötzlich und unerwartet ging sie von uns.

Representatives of private media groups also expressed mild criticism of the three-step test, describing it as a ""relatively pointless procedure"". The removed content meant that ""no publisher earned a single euro more"". RTL Group announced that it was ""still considering legal action against some online publications of ARD and ZDF"".

 Depub.org 

The depublizieren of public Internet content received a new wave of public attention after the implementation of concepts developed for this purpose in September 2010: After an archive of tagesschau.de articles written between 1999 and 2010 had already been offered on the BitTorrent download portal The Pirate Bay in July 2010, the website depub.org put preparation of this archived content online for free retrieval on August 20, 2010, so that users could similarly access the articles to the version on tagesschau.de before depublication. The offer also included the function of continuously archiving current articles from tagesschau.de and making them available on depub.org. Thus, depub.org also acted as a mirror for some articles that had not yet been depublished by tagesschau.de.

Numerous German-language media reported on depub.org, especially from mid-September 2010,Eine Frühe Meldung: Das depublizierte tagesschau.de-Archiv.

407,43817,76233942,9252,Bhagwant Singh,"Bhagwant Singh (also spelled Bhagwat Singh) (1823 – 7 February 1873) was the Maharaj-Rana of Dholpur from 1836 until his death in 1873.

 Biography 
The son of Kirat Singh, Singh succeeded his brother, Pohap Singh, as the Maharaj-Rana of Dholpur in 1836. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, he demonstrated loyal attachment to the East India Company. He rendered assistance to the fugitives from Gwalior in 1857. For his valuable service, he received the insignia of KCSI and was later made GCSI in 1869.

In 1860, Scindia consented to the construction of a bridge over the Chambal, facilitated by the British Government, as part of the trunk road development on the river's right bank. Maharaj-Rana also agreed to this arrangement, with the understanding that the construction costs would be shared equally between the two states, they would equally benefit from the net profits, and in case of the bridge's failure, the ferry at Raj ghat would return to Dholpur, while Scindia would retain the ferry at Khantri.

In 1862, he was guaranteed the right of adoption.

He married Rajauria Maharani Sahiba, the daughter of the Rao of Rajaunia, a scion of the Karauli family and a leading figure in Dholpur. They had a son, Kulendra Singh, who passed away in 1873. He further married a Muslim dancer named Gajra at his Durbar, and with her, he had an issue: a son named Nawab Khwaja Muhammad Khan. Singh also married Basant Kaur, the daughter of Maharaja Narinder Singh of Patiala.

 Gajra ka Maqbara 
The significant project of his era was Gajra ka Maqbara, a mausoleum in Dholpur designed for his beloved Gajra a Muslim lady whom he married. It was modeled after the famous Taj Mahal of Agra. However, he did not live to see its completion.

 Death 
He died on 9 February 1873 and was succeeded by his grandson Nihal Singh as the Maharaj-Rana.

It has been dated to the early third century (from about 200/215 CE).

 Description 

The leaves measure 20 × 11 cm and are inscribed in single columns of 19 to 25 lines each with Alexandrian majuscules. They were probably part of a codex of the Book of Joshua comprising about 72 leaves. The leaves are the oldest surviving evidence of these passages in Greek and represent an older textual variant before Origen's Hexapla. It also differs from the later Masoretic text.

 Variants 

The manuscript does not have verses 15, 17 and 43 of chapter 10 as do other ancient Greek manuscripts that match the Hebrew text.

 Version 

Kristin De Troyer states:

 History 

The manuscript probably originated at Oxyrhynchos. It was probably written by the same scribe as Papyrus Schøyen 2649. Around 1930, the leaves were acquired in Alexandria from an antique dealer by a collector from Zurich. In 1998, the Schøyen Collection in Oslo bought them, signature MS 2648.

411,7483,5271054,25681,Samir Naji Al Hasan Moqbel,"Samir Naji al Hasan Moqbel is a citizen of Yemen who was held in extrajudicial detention in the United States's Guantanamo Bay detention camps, in Cuba.
His Guantanamo Internee Security Number was 043.
The Department of Defense reports Moqbel was born on December 1, 1977, in Taiz, Yemen.

On April 15, 2013, the New York Times published an Op-ed by Moqbel titled ""Gitmo is killing me"". In it he described that he would not eat ""until they restore my dignity."" He wrote that he had lost 30 pounds and described how it feels being force fed. ""As it was thrust in, it made me feel like throwing up. I wanted to vomit, but I couldn't,"" Moqbel wrote. ""There was agony in my chest, throat and stomach. I had never experienced such pain before. I would not wish this cruel punishment upon anyone."" His Op-Ed stirred wide commentary.

In January 2016, Moqbel was among 10 Yemeni detainees that were transferred and resettled in Oman.

Background

Moqbel
arrived at Guantanamo on January 11, 2002, and was held at Guantanamo for 14 years.

In the Op-Ed Moqbel described traveling to Afghanistan to look for work, as he only earned $50 USD per month in Yemen.  
He said he was misled, could not find work in Afghanistan. He denied any association with terrorism.

Historian Andy Worthington noted that Moqbel mocked the extensive justifications offered for his detention, that he had been an Osama bin Laden bodyguard; that he had travelled all over Afghanistan – when he had only arrived in Afghanistan a month prior to his capture.

In his April 2013 Op-ed Moqbel described what it was like to be force-fed at Guantánamo Bay.
Glen Greenwald, writing in The Guardian, praised the New York Times for publishing Moqbel's Op-Ed, which he described as one of the most powerful his readers would ever read.

Official status reviews

Originally the Bush Presidency asserted that captives apprehended in the ""war on terror"" were not covered by the Geneva Conventions, and could be held indefinitely, without charge, and without an open and transparent review of the justifications for their detention.  
In 2004 the United States Supreme Court ruled, in Rasul v. Bush, that Guantanamo captives were entitled to being informed of the allegations justifying their detention, and were entitled to try to refute them.

Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants

Following the Supreme Court's ruling the Department of Defense set up the Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants.
Memos containing the allegations that the DoD thought justified his detention were prepared for formal administrative hearings in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008.
These memos were all published under the Freedom of Information Act.
The DoD also published a seven-page transcript from Moqbel's 2004 hearing and a memo Moqbel prepared for his 2006 hearing.

Scholars at the Brookings Institution, led by Benjamin Wittes, listed the captives still held in Guantanamo in December 2008, according to whether their detention was justified by certain common allegations:

 Samir Naji Al Hasan Moqbel was listed as one of the captives who ""The military alleges ... are associated with both Al Qaeda and the Taliban.""
 Samir Naji Al Hasan Moqbel was listed as one of the captives who ""The military alleges ... traveled to Afghanistan for jihad.""
 Samir Naji Al Hasan Moqbel was listed as one of the captives who ""The military alleges that the following detainees stayed in Al Qaeda, Taliban or other guest- or safehouses.""
 Samir Naji Al Hasan Moqbel was listed as one of the captives who ""The military alleges ... took military or terrorist training in Afghanistan.""
 Samir Naji Al Hasan Moqbel was listed as one of the captives who ""The military alleges ... fought for the Taliban.""
 Samir Naji Al Hasan Moqbel was listed as one of the captives who ""The military alleges ... were at Tora Bora.""
 Samir Naji Al Hasan Moqbel was listed as one of the captives whose ""names or aliases were found on material seized in raids on Al Qaeda safehouses and facilities.""
 Samir Naji Al Hasan Moqbel was listed as one of the captives who ""The military alleges ... served on Osama Bin Laden's security detail.""
 Samir Naji Al Hasan Moqbel was listed as one of the captives who was an ""al Qaeda operative"".

Formerly secret Joint Task Force Guantanamo assessment

On April 25, 2011, whistleblower organization WikiLeaks published formerly secret assessments drafted by Joint Task Force Guantanamo analysts.    
The Telegraph published Moqbel's 10 page assessment, which had been drafted in April 2008.  
His assessment was signed by camp commandant Mark H. Buzby, and recommended Moqbel's continued detention.

The Telegraph quoted from his JTF-GTMO assessment, the claim that Moqbil had acknowledged participating in hostilities.
JTF-GTMO assessed him as having served in the 55th Arab Brigade, as well as Osama bin Laden's bodyguard team. JTF-GTMO assessed him as having participated at the Battle of Tora Bora. JTF-GTMO called him as a member of the dirty thirty. They claimed he had trained at the Al Farouq training camp, and that he had staffed al Qaeda guesthouses. They claimed his name was found on a suspicious list. They claimed ""he acknowledged he was recruited by known al-Qaida member, Marwan Jawan, who also facilitated his travel to Afghanistan.""

Habeas corpus petition

A writ of habeas corpus was filed on Samir Naji Al Hasan Moqbel's behalf.

The Military Commissions Act of 2006 mandated that Guantanamo captives were no longer entitled to access the US civil justice system, so all outstanding habeas corpus petitions were stayed. 

On June 12, 2008, the United States Supreme Court ruled, in Boumediene v. Bush, that the Military Commissions Act could not remove the right for Guantanamo captives to access the US Federal Court system. And all previous Guantanamo captives' habeas petitions were eligible to be re-instated.
The judges considering the captives' habeas petitions would be considering whether the evidence used to compile the allegations the men and boys were enemy combatants justified a classification of ""enemy combatant"". 

On July 15, 2008, Kristine A. Huskey filed a ""NOTICE OF PETITIONERS' REQUEST FOR 30-DAYS NOTICE OF TRANSFER"" on behalf of several dozen captives including Samir Naji Al Hasan Moqbel.

412,50980,369643,8641,Dambulla,"Dambulla ( Dam̆bulla,  Tampuḷḷai) is a city situated in the north of Matale District, in Sri Lanka's Central Province. It is the second largest populated and urbanised centre after Matale in the Matale District. It is situated  north-east of Colombo,  north of Matale and  north of Kandy. Due to its location at a major junction, it is the centre of major vegetable distribution in the country.

Major attractions of the area include the largest and best preserved cave temple complex of Sri Lanka, sigiriya rock fortress located in the division and the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium, famous for being built in just 167 days. The area also boasts the largest rose quartz mountain range in South Asia, and the Iron wood forest, or Na Uyana Aranya.

Ibbankatuwa prehistoric burial site near Dambulla cave temple complexes is the latest archaeological site of significant historical importance found in Dambulla, which is located within  of the cave temples providing evidence of the presence of indigenous civilisations long before the arrival of Indian influence on the Island nation.

History

The area is thought to be inhabited from as early as the 7th to 3rd century BC. Statues and paintings in these caves date back to the 1st century BC. But the paintings and statues were repaired and repainted in the 11th, 12th, and 18th century AD.  The caves in the city provided refuge to King Valagamba (also called Vattagamini Abhaya) in his 14-year-long exile from the Anuradhapura kingdom. Buddhist monks meditating in the caves of Dambulla at that time provided the exiled king protection from his enemies. When King Valagamba returned to the throne at Anuradapura kingdom in the 1st century BC, he had a magnificent rock temple built at Dambulla in gratitude to the monks in Dambulla.

At the Ibbankatuwa Prehistoric burial site near Dhambulla, prehistoric (2700 years old) human skeletons were found on scientific analysis to give evidence of civilisations in this area long before the arrival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. Evidence of ancient people living on agriculture have been detected in this area for over 2700 years according to archaeological findings. (750 BC)

It was earlier known as Dhamballai and was ruled by Kings like Raja Raja Chola and Rajendra Chola during their tenure in the late 10th and early 11th centuries.

Dambulla Cave Temple

It is the largest and best preserved cave temple complex in Sri Lanka. The rock towers  over the surrounding plains. There are more than 80 documented caves in the surrounding. Major attractions are spread over 5 caves, which contain statues and paintings. This paintings and statues are related to Buddha and his life. There are a total of 153 Buddha statues, three statues of Sri Lankan kings and four statues of god and goddess. The latter four include two statues of Hindu gods, Vishnu and Ganesh. The murals cover an area of 2,100 m2. Depictions in the walls of the caves include Buddha's temptation by demon Mara and Buddha's first sermon.

Biography
Early life and education
Pedro B. Navarro, Jr. was born in Tagudin, Ilocos Sur on June 29, 1879 to Pedro Navarro, Sr. and Bartola Bravo. At an early age, he became a choirboy at a local convent. There, he was informally taught ""canto llano"", play the violin, and flute. Eager to learn music, he was accompanied by Fr. Mariano Ortiz to Manila where he entered the Saint Augustine convent. He received musical education from Marcelo Adonay who was then ""Maestro di cappella"". He was choirboy from 1894 to 1898. From 1908 to 1911, he was taught by José Masllovet in musical composition.

Career
After the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution, he left the Augustinian convent for Manila. In 1899, he joined the Philippine Band personally directed by Charles Mindt. He later entered the 12th Volunteer Band and the 6th Artillery Band. During his time there, Walter H. Loving became interested in Navarro and succeeded at recruiting him. In 1903, he enlisted himself at the Philippine Constabulary Band where his most played instrument was the piccolo. In 1907, he became assistant conductor succeeding Pedro Cruz and in 1916 he became permanent band leader after Loving went to the United States only to be hospitalized. Under Loving's leadership he was said to be a good wind instrument player, composer, and a good successor as band director. Navarro also impressed Resident Commissioner for the U.S. Manuel L. Quezon that he was commissioned third lieutenant. Quezon also made him permanent director of the band after Loving.

After his succession, Navarro was greeted by his friends and acquaintances. Under his leadership, he promised to make the Philippine Constabulary Band internationally well-known. He also wished the band to keep its prestige and image. In terms of his leadership style, he was described as strict during rehearhals. Bañas, writing on his biography, stated that he would ""at once correct the slightest mistake"". His leadership only lasted by a year as he retired on 1917. His time as a conductor won the admiration of leading bandmasters, including John Philip Sousa.

Retirement
As a military officer, Navarro received badges as a carbine and revolver expert from the 1920 target season. As a retired bandleader of the Philippine Constabulary Band, he continued his musical expertise by composing marches and other manuscripts, some are works from Bataan such as his ""General Cramer"", a military march, and his ""The Hero"", a funeral march.

 Balanga Maids and Miss Consuelo Gayoso, fox-trot for pianoforte and orchestra

In Baguio, he composed:
""1919–1920 Baguio Academy Cadets"", a military march
Solitude, a caprice for pianoforte

Legacy

Some of the highlight of Navarro's works included in the concert were:
 Paso Doble
 Petit Divertissement for Trombone
 Colonel Loving March
 ""Id Est"", solo for B-flat cornet

Despite his shortcomings as a bandleader of the Philippine Constabulary Band, he was praised by the Filipino populace during his time as a member of the band.

Jones first attended Brookfield's one-room schoolhouse, and went on to attend Danbury High School. His mother died in his junior year. Although he had initially planned to go to law school, as per his mother's aspirations for him to attend Yale, her death made Jones reconsider his future plans.

Jones went on to attend Bard College, drawn by its ""very modern, very liberal"" education program, graduating in 1938. While at Bard, he decided to pursue ministry, and after graduating he attended the General Theological Seminary, from which he graduated with a Master of Divinity degree in 1941, at age 24.

Jones later pursued a Master's in Sacred Theology from New York Theological Seminary. His thesis was titled ""Counseling and the Male Homosexual"".

 Career 
Jones was ordained in the Episcopal Diocese of Connecticut on June 15, 1941. For the next few years, until 1945, he was a pastor at St. James Church in New London. In 1945, He served for a year as a chaplain in the U.S. Maritime Service at New London. Jones became the assistant minister of Hartford's Christ Church Cathedral in 1946. Jones was appointed canon (senior administrative priest) of Hartford's Christ Church Cathedral in 1948.

From 1946 until 1953, Jones served as the diocese's director of youth. At the same time, from 1947 until 1951, he also served as a member of the Episcopal National Youth Commission.

As canon, Jones had immense flexibility in what projects he pursued. His first work in the position was to revitalize local Episcopal summer camps. This would remain an interest of his, and he later became a summer camp administrator for camps across southern New England.

Jones retired in 1986. However, he remained active in local ministry. He joined the Greater Hartford Regional Ministry in 1990, later serving as the group's president. He continue to work with the group for years, only stopping shortly before his death.

 Activism 
In the 1960s, Jones was appointed to the Rehabilitation Committee for the Greater Hartford Council of Churches. The committee addressed a variety of issues, including alcoholism, drug addiction, and the care of mental health patients, but Jones became particularly interested in researching homosexuality and the issues surrounding it. He ultimately decided that the issues would be best served by having a specific group dedicated to addressing homosexuality.

In 1963, Jones founded Project H alongside George Higgins, a professor from Trinity College, and attorney Donald Cantor. The group's name was chosen as a way to discreetly refer to homosexuality. The group focused on providing counseling services for gay Christians in the region. Meetings were held at the YMCA in Hartford, with social workers, psychologists, and clergy in attendance. Members of the group would go on to found the Kalos Society in 1968, considered the state's first LGBT political advocacy organization.

In 1965, Jones met with Alfred Gross, founder of the New York-based George H. Henry Foundation, a group similar to Project H. Jones subsequently opened a Hartford chapter of the foundation, with Gross's help.

In 1966, the Hartford Council of Churches agreed to pay for a private phone line in Jones' office, to protect the privacy of the individuals he was working with. Jones also ensured that his office was reachable by a private entrance, so visitors could enter and talk to him discreetly.

In 1966, Jones and his colleagues at Project H were told that the Connecticut Department of Corrections had established a separate block, ""Block G"", for inmates who were gay or transgender. The following year, Jones negotiated meetings with the warden, and after finding out that the Block G inmates were being treated more poorly than other inmates, attempted to convince the warden to dissolve the block. Although he was unsuccessful, Jones was able to provide counseling to individual inmates in Block G. He would continue providing counseling to gay and transgender inmates until his retirement in 1986.

In the late 1960s, Jones founded the Married Gay Men's Group of Hartford.

In 1971, Jones and Project H colleague George Higgins founded the Twenty-One Club, which primarily served transgender individuals, providing them with counseling and psychiatric services. The group continued to meet at the church for 30 years.

Later in the 1970s, Jones founded the Gender Identity Clinic of New England, which connected transgender people to social and healthcare workers who helped patients access affirming mental health treatments, hormone therapy, and gender-affirming surgery.

In late 1973, Jones gave a seminar on ""transsexualism"" to Hartford's Police Community Relations Department.

In 1976, Jones was a witness representing Integrity for the Joint Commission on the Church and Human Affairs, an Episcopal commission which was ""study[ing] the gay issue"".

In 1986, with Jones' retirement, Project H (which had been renamed the Committee on Sexual Minorities in 1980) disbanded, as the presence of other LGBT organizations in the area meant the services provided by Project H had become increasingly less vital.

 Personal life and death 
Jones was known for his manners and his formality. One story goes that when he was temporarily housing a transexual teenager who had been kicked out of her home, the teenager found herself ""completely at sea when confronted with the formalized gentility of Jones’s home"" and his ""formal dinner[s]"".

Jones was gay, and was in a domestic partnership with church musician Kenneth Woods for 40 years; however, he was not open about his sexuality during his lifetime. After Jones retired in 1986, the two moved to Manchester, Connecticut.

Jones died of pancreatic cancer in 2006. After his death, Woods inherited his property.

 Legacy 
In 2005, The Friends of Christ Church Cathedral created the Canon Clinton R. Jones Award in honor of Jones' decades of ministry. The award was to be given annually to ""a person of faith who works quietly in the community on issues at the cutting edge of change"".

427,7748,5273322,1947,Tugendhat chair,"The Tugendhat chair (model number MR70) is a modernist cantilever chair designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in collaboration with Lilly Reich 1929–1930 for the Tugendhat House in Brno, Czechoslovakia.

In appearance, the Tugendhat chair is somewhat of a hybrid of van der Rohe and Reich's 1929 Barcelona chair and 1929–1930 Brno chair. Like the Barcelona chair, the Tugendhat chair has a large padded leather seat and back, supported by leather straps mounted on a steel frame and legs.  However, like one variant of the Brno chair, the frame is flat solid steel, formed under into a C-shape under the seat to create a cantilever.  Versions exist with or without leather-padded steel arms.  The metal was originally polished stainless steel; modern examples are often chrome-plated. 

It was first produced by Joseph Müller Berliner Metall-Gewerbe and was later licensed to American furniture manufacturer Knoll, who produced a limited number of the chairs with and without arms from 1948.

429,7136,75173456,13372,Muslim Burut,"Muslim bin Haji Burut (15 April 1943 – 15 June 2021), pen name Muslim Burmat, was a writer from Brunei who wrote a great deal of literature, particularly novels and short stories that are used in Brunei's educational institutions. In addition to receiving numerous literary honours, his works—which are primarily realistic but also include fresh historiography—showcase aspects of Brunei society.

 Early life and education 
Muslim obtained his early education at the Gadong Malay School and Sultan Muhammad Jamalul Alam Malay School. He taught Malay before continuing on to Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien College for lower secondary education taught in English. After his third year, he departed to work for the Marine Department, and in 1964, he joined the Land Department as a clerk. He assisted the families of those imprisoned following the failed 1962 Brunei revolt, in which the military branch of the opposition Brunei People's Party sought to take control, during this time. He became an assistant author at the Language and Literature Bureau in 1966.

 Literature 
Before releasing his debut novel, Muslim spent twenty years writing cerpen (short stories) under the pen name Muslim Burmat. Early writings that are set in Brunei but have English characters clearly reflect his interest in non-Bruneians, especially Westerners, and their interactions with the East. One defining aspect of his work is still his predilection for using conversation to establish character and convey ideas. He studied Malay studies at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur during 1968. He spent his year in England, which included a few quick trips around the Continent, studying writing and publishing at the University of London's Institute of Education in Tropical Areas in 1971–1972. During the period when short stories with regional settings made up the majority of Bruneian fiction, his works are set in Europe and include multiracial non-Bruneian protagonists.

Muslim advanced through the Language and Literature Bureau ranks from assistant author to language officer to senior language officer. After retiring in 1996, he served as the University of Brunei Darussalam's writer-in-residence until 2000. While some of Muslim Burmat's novels are available in Malaysian university libraries, his books are only available in Brunei and have not been translated into any other language. His writing career has won him several awards for his prolific output of children's books, short tales, and novels.

Muslim died on 15 June 2021. At the Master's Literary Award Multaqa: Memoir Muslim Burmat, held at Balai Sarmayuda, the acting director of the Language and Library Council (DBP) mentioned a number of topics, including these ones, in his welcome address. The speaker observed that Muslim Burmat enjoys considerable regard as a literary personality both within and outside of his country due to the significant impact of his writings on nationalism.

 Personal life 
Muslim was born on 15 April 1943, in Kiarong, Brunei Town of Kedayan ethnicity. He is one of the eight kids to his mother, Bani binti Ali, and father, Burut bin Ahmad, of which both were uneducated. After being married, Muslim had a single child with Kamsiah binti Sulaiman. He lives in his birthplace of Kiarong. upon addition to writing, he oversees Seri Bulan (Beautiful Moon), a restaurant he founded upon his retirement, and engages in his lifelong passion of bird raising.

Salim bin Mahfouz, according to his own account, proposed the idea of a Saudi bank during a newspaper meeting.

Moses Craig (1797–1874), a wealthy farmer, owned the lime kilns, which were built about 1860, and a local limestone quarry. The limestone was burnt in the kilns and used in agriculture as a soil additive and used in construction to make mortar and whitewash.

 Early career 
Terry began training as early as 2014 when fellow countryman Johnny Moss first opened his professional wrestling school in England. At just 16 years of age, Terry made his debut as the first of 15 entrants in a Rumble Match.

 Professional wrestling career 
WWE
Early appearances and NXT UK (2018–2023)
Terry made his first WWE appearance on the 7 November 2018 episode of 205 Live under the ring name Josh Morrell, where he lost against Lio Rush. Terry made another appearance on the 2 January 2019 episode of NXT UK as Josh Morrell, where he lost a match to Wild Boar. On 2 September 2023, under the name Riley Osborne, he made his official debut with WWE on NXT Level Up in a loss against Javier Bernal. On 30 November, Osborne made his main roster debut on Main Event in a losing effort to Apollo Crews.

NXT (2023–2025)
In December 2023, Osborne was announced as a participant in the NXT Men's Breakout Tournament and was introduced as a student of Chase University. Osborne defeated Keanu Carver in the first round and Lexis King in the semi-finals but lost to Oba Femi in the finals at NXT: New Year's Evil on 2 January 2024. Later in January, in an attempt to save Chase U from debt, Osborne and fellow Chase U member Duke Hudson entered the Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic but lost in the first round to Joaquin Wilde and Cruz Del Toro of Latino World Order. During this time, Osborne began a romantic relationship with fellow Chase U student Thea Hail and asked her out on a date at NXT Vengeance Day for Valentine's Day which she accepted. After their date on Valentine's Day didn't end well due to Hail being given advice by Jacy Jayne to play hard to get, Osborne and Hail both agreed to remain friends. On the 19 March episode of NXT, Osborne challenged No Quarter Catch Crew's Drew Gulak for the NXT Heritage Cup but lost 2-1 to Gulak after interference from Jayne and Jazmyn Nyx, who turned against Chase U.

In early May 2024, Ridge Holland started associating himself with Chase U. On the 14 May episode of NXT, Andre Chase offered Osborne to be Holland's tag team partner in his match against The Good Brothers (Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson) to Osborne's dissatisfaction. The Good Brothers won the match after another mishap from Holland. On the 21 May episode of NXT, Fallon Henley defeated Hail to qualify for a spot in the six-woman ladder match to crown the inaugural NXT Women's North American Championship at NXT Battleground. Backstage, Osborne got into an argument with Holland for costing Hail the match, to which Chase proposed that both men settle their differences in the ring where Holland defeated Osborne. After the match, Osborne still do not approve of Chase U working with Holland, with Hudson taking Osborne's side. On the 4 June episode of NXT, Osborne and Hudson refused to walk out with Holland for Hail's match against Jazmyn Nyx. Halfway through the match, Osborne and Hudson showed up to ringside to Hail's surprise, to which Nyx used as an advantage to defeat Hail. On the November 19 episode of NXT, Holland, who had subsequently joined and defected Chase U, defeated Chase with the future of Chase U on the line, causing Chase U to disband.

Evolve (2025-present)
Osborne made his first WWE appearance after Chase U's disbandment on the 12 March 2025 episode of Evolve, where he lost to Meta-Four's Oro Mensah.

 Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2024) 
On the 15 August 2024 episode of Impact!, Terry, as Riley Osborne, made his Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) debut as an NXT representative to defeat Chris Bey and John Skyler in a three-way match to qualify for the Ultimate X match at Emergence.

 Personal life 
In December 2023, Terry got engaged to fellow professional wrestler Bea Priestley. They were married in July 2024.

The forest is a remnant of extensive beech and podocarp forests that previously covered inland parts of North Canterbury. Species present in the forest include mountain beech and examples of the podocarps rimu, mataī, kahikatea, and tōtara. The forest is mainly black beech (Nothofagus solandri) at lower altitudes, with mountain beech (Nothofagus cliffortioides) above . From around 1851 to 1909, logging took place in the Oxford Forest and the nearby Woodside Forest property. Several fires in the late 19th century destroyed much of the forest, and logging ceased in 1915. Some areas of beech forest regenerated following a major fire in 1898. Sheep were grazed in some places from 1914, but grazing reduced after the 1930s, allowing more land to revert to beech. By 1973, the area was being managed as a forest park, with increasing areas of regenerating beech and plantations of exotic species.

The Oxford Forest Conservation Area is classified as stewardship land, under section 25 of the Conservation Act 1987. It includes walking and mountain biking tracks and is a recreational hunting area. The conservation area includes Mount Oxford, with a height of .

International Dark Sky Park

In 2024, the conservation area was designated by DarkSky International as New Zealand's second International Dark Sky Park. Readings of night sky luminance in the park have a median value of 21.45 mag/arcsec2 (corresponding to Bortle scale 3), and in places are as dark as 21.76 and 21.80 mag/arcsec2 (Bortle scale 1). 

The application for designation was prepared by the Oxford Dark Sky Group, with member organisations including the Department of Conservation, the Waimakariri District Council, local schools, the Oxford Promotions Action Committee, community groups and sports clubs. The accreditation of the Oxford Forest Conservation Area is an initial step towards a larger dark-sky preserve.

 Description 

Sylvatest is an acousto-ultrasonic measuring device that provides an overall diagnosis of the wood element, based on the speed and energy absorption of the transmitted ultrasonic wave. The result given reflects the residual health of the wood in the trunk of the tree tested or the beam measured. These are non-destructive tests.

The technology was developed by Professor Jean-Luc Sandoz as part of his thesis at EPFL in 1984 and was further developed by researcher Yann Benoit in 1998.

 Applications 
The sylvatest is used in many countries (Brazil, Europe and Asia).

It has been used on historic buildings such as the Entrepôts des magasins généraux in Paris, the Forbidden City in Beijing, and the beams of Notre-Dame de Paris or even the Château de Valère.

It is also used to certify the quality of wood for registered designations of origin such as Bois des Alpes or Bois de Chatreuse.

442,21726,75610719,11698,South Park (Not Suitable for Children),"""South Park (Not Suitable for Children)"" is a 2023 American adult animated comedy television special episode. It is the sixth South Park television special, and the 327th episode of the series overall. The special premiered on December 20, 2023 on Paramount+.

The episode parodies the internet subscription service OnlyFans and social media influencers, including Logan Paul and his product, Prime beverages.

Plot
Parents and school administrators at South Park Elementary have become concerned at how a hydration drink called Cred has been popularized by social media influencers to the point that students carry it as a status symbol. This has led fourth grader Clyde Donovan to falsely portray himself as a regular drinker of Cred. His father Roger and stepmother Janice forbid him from drinking it due to the artificial sweeteners it contains, but Clyde rebuffs Janice, whom he says is not really his mother. Clyde's classmates, Eric Cartman, Tweek Tweek, and Butters Stotch, invite Clyde into their exclusive affinity group for Cred drinkers. To perpetuate his false image as a Cred drinker, he purchases a black market empty Cred bottle from Nathan and fills it with apple juice, but this is discovered, and the entire group is shunned. To rehabilitate their image, they travel to an event in Pueblo, Colorado to purchase a limited edition Super Cred, but a mob of children there degenerates into a riot. The group realizes they have been manipulated by influencers, and resolve to find Clyde's favorite influencer, Logan LeDouche.

Meanwhile, Randy Marsh begins making bottomless OnlyFans videos, but Sharon, who disapproves, counters by creating an OnlyFans account of her own, which is far more successful. To increase his subscriber count, he begins using Cred in his videos as a trending topic. Sharon becomes concerned that the views come from minors, but Randy refuses to stop. After an influence agent explains to him how sponsors bid against each other to have top social influencers promote their products, Randy participates in an auction where influence is auctioned off to the highest bidder. There, he is arrested by the FBI, whose agents show him pornographic images of ""miners"", prompting him to cooperate. Clyde and his friends confront Logan, who explains that he merely works for a higher power to influence people, but before he can reveal his sponsor, he is assassinated by a sniper.

The FBI shoots the assassin off a rooftop, who is revealed to be the auctioneer, functioning as a middleman. Returning home, the children see Randy throwing away his entire supply of Cred. He is doing this, he explains, because the social media industry is not suitable for children, who need to know that they are always being targeted, and need to know who wants to influence them the most. Clyde returns home and confronts Janice for being the unseen influencer in his life. She admits that she used Cred, despite being against its consumption by children, because it helped attract Clyde's views, so that they talk more and bond. When Clyde asks her if he can call her ""mom"", she agrees, but he then says, ""Fuck you, mom!"" before storming off. Despite this, Janice's heart is warmed by him addressing her as his mother.

At school the next day, the affinity group shows off a highly-sought-after Cred flavor salvaged from Randy, a bottle of which Cartman gives to Clyde. He drinks it and says it tastes amazing, prompting the rest of the schoolchildren to rejoice.

Development
On August 5, 2021, Comedy Central announced that Trey Parker and Matt Stone had signed a $900 million deal for extending the series to 30 seasons through 2027 and 14 feature films, exclusive to the Paramount+ streaming platform. Later that month, it was revealed that two films per year would be released during that time. Parker and Stone would later state that the projects would not be feature films, and that it was ViacomCBS who decided to advertise them as movies.

Reception
Drunken Yoda with Last Movie Outpost rated the episode 3½ out of 5 stars, commenting how he enjoyed the jabs at influencer culture but felt the show missed its mark, and stated in his review, ""I appreciate at least they are identifying problems no one else in the legacy media will even come close to touching with a 10-foot pole, but they continue to miss the targets, or at the very least, pull back when they should be doing the Mortal Kombat 'FINISH HIM!' move. I guess I’ll take what I can get.""

John Schwarz with Bubbleblabber rated the episode a 9.5 out of 10, stating that while he questioned the overall influence of media, ""I could hear an argument on how non-fictitious programming and advertiser-influenced magazines can help nudge the minds of those of whom are uneducated and immature in understanding of basic principles of comprehension."" He summarized his review stating, ""If you’re looking for an early Christmas treat from the best adult animated sitcom property of all-time, well this is the way to go.""

Writing for Screen Rant, Cathal Gunning noted that the main characters of South Park had seemingly changed from the four main boys (Kyle, Stan, Kenny and Eric) to Randy Marsh, but that this episode hurt Randy's character. Gunning stated in his review, ""While focusing on Clyde's plight in 'Not Suitable for Children' worked well, this left the special's subplot feeling like it belonged in a different show altogether. The tale about Stan's father setting up an OnlyFans account didn't really gel with the primary narrative since Stan was barely featured in the special, so Randy's subplot was barely related to the main story. Unfortunately, this isn't the first time South Park struggled with this exact issue in its feature-length specials.""

Logan Paul reacted positively on Twitter to the parody of him and Prime beverages by recreating a live rendition of the commercial for Cred shown during the episode and commenting ""Thanks for the CRED 
@SouthPark"".

444,50818,368740,6730,Theodore Wright,"This is about the British soldier; for others, see Theodore Wright (disambiguation).

Captain Theodore Wright, VC (15 May 1883 – 14 September 1914) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Details
Wright was born in May 1883 in Brighton, and received his education from Clifton College and the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. He was commissioned into the Royal Engineers as a second lieutenant on 1 October 1902 and promoted to captain in October 1913.

He was thirty one years old, and a captain in the 57th Field Company, Corps of Royal Engineers, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 23 August 1914 at Jemappes, Mons, Belgium, a company of the Royal Scots Fusiliers were holding a barricade at the north end of a bridge over the Mons-Condé canal. By this time the firing on the position had become so violent and the casualties were so numerous that a retirement had been decided on. Lance-Corporal Charles Jarvis, of the Royal Engineers was then called upon to destroy the bridge but was without the exploder and leads. It was then that he met Captain Theodore Wright, who had been wounded in the head, who told him to go back to the bridge and he would bring the necessary equipment.

It was whilst attempting to connect the leads under the bridge to blow it that Theodore Wright earned his Victoria Cross. Time and again he tried to get at the end of the leads but each time he raised his head above the level of the towpath he was fired upon from about thirty yards off. Eventually he gave up the attempt and in swinging himself back under the girder of the bridge he lost his grip and owing to exhaustion fell into the canal, and was pulled out by a Sergeant Smith. (Corporal Alfred Jarvis was also awarded the Victoria Cross for this action).

At Vailly, Aube, on 14 September 1914, Theodore Wright assisted the passage of the 5th Cavalry Brigade over a pontoon bridge, and was mortally wounded whilst assisting wounded men into shelter. An officer of the Scots Greys wrote in a letter later ""We got across the river the day before yesterday a bit before our time and we had to go back over a pontoon bridge considerably quicker than was pleasant, under a very heavy fire too. At the end of the bridge was an Engineer officer repairing bits blown off and putting down straw as cool as a cucumber – the finest thing I ever saw. The poor fellow was killed just after my troops got across. No man earned a better Victoria Cross.""

Wright's citation in the London Gazette read:

Wright is buried at the Vailly British Cemetery, France.

447,974,5255800,13672,New York State Route 258,"New York State Route 258 (NY 258) is a state highway located entirely within the town of Groveland in Livingston County, New York, in the United States. It connects NY 36 in the hamlet of Ross Corners to NY 63 in the hamlet of Groveland Station. NY 258 is named Flats Road and passes through the flat terrain of the valley surrounding Canaseraga Creek. Most of NY 258 is routed along the Groveland–West Sparta town line.

Although modern NY 258 is nothing more than a simple east–west connector between NY 36 and NY 63, it originally extended westward past NY 36 to NY 408 in the town of Mount Morris when it was first assigned in the early 1930s. By 1983, maintenance of all of NY 258 west of NY 36 had been transferred to Livingston County, leading to the truncation of the route to NY 36 in the mid-1990s.

Route description

NY 258 begins at an intersection with NY 36 on the Groveland–West Sparta town line. The route heads eastward down a small hill, which leads to the flat terrain and open fields of the Canaseraga Creek valley that gives NY 258 the name of Flats Road. About  east of NY 36, NY 258 crosses the Dansville and Mount Morris Railroad. East of the railroad crossing, NY 258 veers northeastward off the town line as it approaches the hamlet of Groveland Station. In its final , the route passes over Canaseraga Creek and climbs slightly in elevation upon entering Groveland Station. NY 258 terminates in the center of the hamlet at a junction with NY 63.

History
When NY 258 was assigned , it extended from NY 63 (now NY 408) in the town of Mount Morris to NY 36A (modern NY 63) in Groveland. In between, NY 258 served the hamlet of Tuscarora and intersected NY 36. NY 245, a parallel route to the south that extended from Pike to the city of Geneva via Dansville, was realigned between the villages of Nunda and Dansville in the late 1940s to overlap NY 408, NY 258, and NY 36 between the two locations. The overlap between NY 245 and NY 258 was eliminated in the late 1950s when NY 245 was restored to its previous, direct alignment between Nunda and Dansville.

NY 258 through the Groveland Flats of Canaseraga Creek were a constant flooding location during the spring and autumn.  Fishermen would use Groveland Flats certain times for fishing for carp that would flood through the flats.  After flooding in September 1967,  a new study came out about how to deal with the flooding. This would have involved inundating NY 258 through the Groveland Flats with water. Thomas F. McGowan, a New York State Assemblyman, opposed the project because losing the stretch of NY 258 would cut a vital connection between NY 36 and NY 63. It also would force a detour of  for commuters and isolate members of the Groveland Fire District.  The new project proposed to cost $7.4 million (1968 USD), despite opposition of Assemblyman James Emery of Geneseo, who preferred working with the state on improving NY 258.  In March 1968, Emery announced that the New York State Department of Transportation had a project ready to be started for raising NY 258 through the Groveland Flats. 

The project to raise NY 258 through the Groveland Flats hit a snag in 1969 due to delays related to the construction of the Genesee Expressway. The work involved the possibility of NY 258 and the expressway overlapping, so they chose to work on the projects concurrently, which involved deferring NY 258. Assemblyman Emery was notified that the expressway would be on the section of NY 258 west of the Groveland Flats and there was no reason to continue deferral. On February 14, 1970, Emery announced that NYSDOT would start construction on the project in 1972, with a slated completion in 1973. The new project would raise NY 258 above the flood line. 

On April 1, 1983, ownership and maintenance of NY 258 between Main Street in Tuscarora and NY 36 at Ross Corners was transferred from the state of New York to Livingston County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. NY 258's routing was unchanged; instead, it became concurrent with County Route 72 (CR 72) as a result of the shift in maintenance. It became the second section of NY 258 to be transferred to Livingston County, as the portion from NY 408 near Brooks Grove to Presbyterian Road in Tuscarora had been co-designated as part of CR 3 sometime prior to the swap. The county-maintained western extension of NY 258 remained intact until the mid-1990s when NY 258 was truncated to its junction with NY 36 at Ross Corners.

452,38744,76102304,4895,Het pand der goden,"Het pand der goden (Dutch for The Building of the Gods) is an opera written by composer Johannes Helstone.

Het pand der goden is recorded as being the first opera by a Surinamese composer. A drama in five acts, it premiered in the Thalia Theatre (Paramaribo), Suriname.

Plot
Hero Haika Marghanold and his wife Heloinka welcome their first child, a daughter. Preferring a son, Marghanold decides to treat another boy, born on the same day, as his own adopted son. This act defies the gods' will, leading them to curse their daughter by making her irresistibly beautiful, resulting in her mysterious disappearance from the earth during a storm.

The loss of his daughter causes Hero such profound grief that he dies shortly after Olindo's birth. In the wake of these tragedies, Heloinka and Olindo isolate themselves from the rest of the world.

As time passes, Olindo hears rumors that suggest his sister might still be alive in the north. Motivated by the chance to reunite with her, he embarks on a dangerous journey to find her. His journey is marked by adversity, including a shipwreck, from which he barely survives.

Committed to finding his sister and returning to his mother, Olindo begins a period of penance. In the gripping final act, his perseverance pays off, and he finally finds his long-lost sister.

Premiere and disappearance
The premiere is said to have taken place on May 10, 1906, under the direction of the composer. The first review on May 17 gives Thursday, May 12, as the initial date. The audience (Helstone was adorned with a wreath) and artists were wildly enthusiastic.

Rediscovery
During the opening of the Suriname Cultural Center in February 1954, it was performed again, but only the overture. This was because three other pieces were also performed. It was then observed that, although it was a skilled work, it was completely outside the Surinamese music tradition. In 1963, there was a brief retrospective on Helstone's life, during which the content was mentioned again, as well as the fact that the work might have had several performances in German in Berlin. After that, it seemed to disappear for good.

During the late 20th century, violist John Helstone of the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra came into the possession of his Johannes Helstone's archives. Alongside his cousin Astrid Helstone, they organized the documents, receiving assistance from David Bazen of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. Their research led to a biography of Helstone by Diederik Burgersdijk titled Een opera voor Suriname; over Het pand der goden, and led to a (partial) performance by the Concertgebouw Orchestra under the direction of Otto Tausk.

453,31177,5334921,20645,Florence Maybrick,"Florence Elizabeth Chandler Maybrick (3 September 1862 – 23 October 1941) was an American woman convicted in the United Kingdom of murdering her husband, cotton merchant James Maybrick.

Early life

Florence Maybrick was born Florence Elizabeth Chandler in Mobile, Alabama. She was the daughter of William George Chandler, a one-time mayor of Mobile and a partner in the banking firm of St. John Powers and Company,Maybrick, Florence E. Mrs Maybrick's Own Story: My Lost Fifteen Years Funk and Wagnalls Company (1904) and Caroline Chandler Du Barry, née Holbrook. Florence's father had died before her birth.Bruce Robinson, They All Love Jack: Busting the Ripper, 2015, p. 487 Her mother married in 1872 her third husband Baron Adolph von Roques, a cavalry officer in the Eighth Cuirassier Regiment of the German Army.

Marriage
While travelling by ship to the United Kingdom, Florence met James Maybrick, a cotton merchant from Liverpool. Other passengers were either amused or shocked by a 17-year-old girl spending so much time alone in the company of Maybrick, who was 23 years her senior. A year later, on 27 July 1881, the couple were married at St James's Church, Piccadilly, in London. They settled in Battlecrease House, Aigburth, a suburb of Liverpool.Ryan Jr., Bernard. The Poisoned Life of Mrs. Maybrick (1977)

Florence made quite an impression on the social scene in Liverpool, and the Maybricks were usually to be found at the most important balls and functions, the very picture of a happy, successful couple. But Maybrick, a hypochondriac, was a regular user of arsenic and patent medicines containing poisonous chemicals and had a number of mistresses, one of whom bore him five children. Florence meanwhile, increasingly unhappy in her marriage, entered into several liaisons of her own. One was with a local businessman, Alfred Brierley, which her husband was told about. A violent row ensued after Maybrick heard reports of Florence's relationship with Brierley, during which Maybrick assaulted her and announced his intention of seeking a divorce. The wish for divorce seemed mutual.

James Maybrick was taken ill on 27 April 1889 after self-administering a double dose of strychnine. His doctors treated him for acute dyspepsia, but his condition deteriorated. On 8 May, Florence wrote a compromising letter to Brierley, which was intercepted by Alice Yapp, a nanny who hated Florence. Yapp intercepted all letters sent by Florence and passed them on to Maybrick's brother, Edwin, who was staying at Battlecrease. Edwin, himself by many accounts one of Florence's lovers, shared the contents of the letter with his brother Michael Maybrick, who was effectively the head of the family and who also hated Florence. By Michael's orders, Florence was immediately deposed as mistress of her house and held under house arrest. On 9 May, a nurse reported that Florence had surreptitiously tampered with a Valentine's Meat Juice bottle that was afterwards found to contain a half-grain of arsenic. Florence later testified that her husband had begged her to administer it as a pick-me-up. However, he never drank its contents.Davenport-Hines, Richard. ""Maybrick, Florence Elizabeth (1862–1941)"", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004

Maybrick died at his home in Aigburth on 11 May 1889. In her memoir, Mrs. Maybrick's Own Story: My Fifteen Lost Years, Florence describes the following, as she knelt down by her late husband's bedside:

Murder charge
His brothers, suspicious as to the cause of death, had his body examined. It was found to contain slight traces of arsenic, but not enough to be considered fatal. It is uncertain whether this was taken by Maybrick himself or administered by another person. In April 1889, Florence Maybrick was accused of using flypaper containing arsenic from a local chemist's shop and later soaked in a bowl of water. After an inquest held in a nearby hotel, Florence was charged with his murder and stood trial at St George's Hall, Liverpool, before Mr. Justice Stephen, where she was convicted and sentenced to death. Her trial was reported in newspapers as being a miscarriage of justice, as the prosecution evidence was baffling. After the verdict, crowds shouted in favour of Florence, believing she was being accused of a murder she had not committed.

After a public outcry, Henry Matthews, the Home Secretary, and Lord Chancellor Halsbury concluded 'that the evidence clearly establishes that Mrs Maybrick administered poison to her husband with intent to murder; but that there is ground for reasonable doubt whether the arsenic so administered was in fact the cause of his death'.Buckle, G. E. (ed.) The Letters of Queen Victoria  3rd ser. (1930–32), vol. 1, p. 527 The death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment as punishment for a crime with which she was never charged. During the 1890s, new evidence was publicized by Florence's supporters, but there was no possibility of an appeal, and the Home Office was not inclined to release her in spite of the strenuous efforts of Lord Russell of Killowen, the Lord Chief Justice.

The case became something of a cause célèbre and attracted considerable newspaper coverage on both sides of the Atlantic. Arsenic was then regarded by some men as an aphrodisiac and tonic, and Maybrick had certainly taken it on a regular basis. A city chemist confirmed that he had supplied Maybrick with quantities of the poison over a lengthy period and a search of Battlecrease House later turned up enough to kill at least fifty people. Although her marriage was clearly over in all but name, Florence had little motive to murder her husband. The financial provision Maybrick had made for her and his children in his will was paltry and she might have been far better off with him alive but legally separated from him. Many people held the view that Florence had poisoned her husband because he was about to divorce her which, in Victorian society, would see her ruined. An even more compelling motive might have been the prospect of losing the custody of her beloved children.

After fifteen years of research, writer and film director Bruce Robinson published They All Love Jack: Busting the Ripper (2015),Robinson, Bruce ""They All Love Jack: Busting the Ripper"" (Fourth Estate, 2015) a comprehensive study of Jack the Ripper, in which he makes a case that Florence and her husband were the victims of her brother-in-law, Michael, whom Robinson claims was actually the Ripper.

 Time at Woking Convict Prison 

Following the commutation of Florence's sentence, she was transported to Woking District Female Convict Prison, where she remained until 1896 when she was moved to Aylesbury Prison. Florence spent her first nine months in solitary confinement before being moved to a different cell but remaining under the strictures of the silent system, whereby silence was enforced at all times. Her memoirs reveal the physical and mental toll that solitary confinement had on her. She dubbed the practice 'by far the most cruel feature of English penal servitude' and emphasised the 'desolation and despair' that the 'hopeless monotony' of confinement led her to feel. During her time at Woking, Florence suffered from insomnia and frequent ill health caused, she claimed, by the frequent shrieking and destruction of the content of cells during the night by weak-minded inmates, which left her with 'quivering nerves' and unable to sleep.

Having passed through the first stages of solitary confinement and a probationary period, Maybrick then entered a third stage of hard labour whereby she was permitted to leave her cell during the day to assist in carrying meals from the kitchen.  Her day commenced at 6.00 a.m. and ended at 5.30 p.m., during which she had, according to her memoirs, to wash ten four-quart cans, scrub one twenty-foot table and two twelve-foot dressers, clean knives, wash a sack of potatoes, assist in serving the dinners and scrub a piece of floor twenty by ten feet. During 1896, Maybrick entered into the prison infirmary for two weeks, suffering from a 'feverish cold' caused, she claimed, by the inadequate clothing, bedding and draughty cells.  It was at the end of her time in the infirmary on 4 November 1896 that she was transferred to Aylesbury prison.

Maybrick did speak well of the warders she encountered during her incarceration, describing their 'patience, civility, and self-control'.

Release

After detention in Woking and Aylesbury prisons, Florence was released in January 1904, having spent more than 14 years in custody. Although she had lost her U.S. citizenship when she married her British husband, it was restored when she returned to her home country. Initially she earned a living on the lecture circuit, speaking on prison reform and protesting her innocence. In later life, she moved to Connecticut and used her maiden name, Florence Elizabeth Chandler. After some months spent unsuccessfully as a housekeeper, Florence became a recluse, living in a squalid three-room bungalow in Gaylordsville, Connecticut, a village in New Milford, with only her cats for company. A few sympathetic residents eventually discovered Florence's true identity but kept her secret.

Florence Maybrick died alone and penniless in her home in New Milford on 23 October 1941, and the next day her obituary was published at the top of Page One of The New York Times. She was buried at her request next to her dear friend, Clara Dulon, in South Kent, Connecticut on the grounds of South Kent School. Among her few possessions were a scrapbook with newspaper clippings of her former life and a tattered family Bible. She never saw her children again; they were raised by the family's doctor. Her son, who became a mining engineer, died in 1911 of accidental poisoning when he mistook a cyanide solution for a glass of water.

Soon after her release, Florence wrote a book about her experiences,  Mrs. Maybrick's Own Story: My Fifteen Lost Years, which is available online. A rare copy is still held by Liverpool City Libraries.

454,17143,75474968,8574,Fatimid rock crystal amulets,"Rock crystal amulets in the Islamic world date back to the 9th century CE and were used to offer well-being and religious protection. A range of forms and materials were used to produce amulets and to bring upon various powers and protections. Rock crystal amulets physically connect a person to magic and religion through significant qualities of their materials and inscriptions. The inscriptions on rock crystal amulets ranged from long to short phrases, or just single words, indicating their unique personalization.

Rock crystal appears to have been a popular material for the production of amulets in the medieval Islamic world. Many objects made of rock crystal, such as ewers and drinking vessels, were being produced in the Fatimid Caliphate during the late medieval era, and it is not surprising that rock crystal amulets are often linked to the Fatimids. Within the context of the Fatimid Caliphate, strong associations between rock crystal and water, tied to the former’s transparency and ability to refract light, may have made the material particularly appropriate for amulets whose function was bringing rain. This is further supported by the existence of a few amulets bearing text that references water or features calls for rain.

 Material significance of rock crystal 
Classical Arab writers such as al-Biruni and Ahmad ibn Usuf al-Tifashi believed rock crystals to be frozen or congealed water because of how close their resembled water. Due to this belief, Fatimids considered the rock crystal to be a solid and tangible embodiment of water and its powerful qualities. In Islamic culture, water was considered very pure because it embodies all elements of life. This resemblance between crystal to water gave it qualities of its purity, which further connected it to the belief of Paradise. The idea of this Paradise is mentioned in the Quran (37;45-66) stating that at paradise a person “will be passed to them a cup from a clear flowing fountain, crystal-white of a taste of devious to those who drink.” In order to obtain full qualities of water they must have the highest quality of rock crystal its characteristics must be  “limpid and transparent, of the strongest white, free from cracks”.

As a result of these powerful qualities associated between material and religious properties, Fatimid caliphs in Egypt from 969-1171 sought after rock crystal. The crystal was used for everyday objects such as lamps and bowls, but the translucent qualities brought difficulty while craving these objects. However, this quality contributed to its religious connotations. The light that shown through the rock crystal lamps was attributed to life like qualities that shown through the object. Vessels made of the material often held holy water or were tied to magical healing properties, that if a king were to drink from would bring him good. Because of its inherent magical and healing properties the rock crystal was used for amulets.

 Function 
The function of rock crystal amulets is derived from their fabrication process, specifically the material they are made up of and inscriptions. Amulet inscriptions can hold negative and positive powers, which affects the way in which people interact with them. For example the function of a reversed print amulet could act as a stamp, where the phrase could be printed and its relief would appear correctly on a surface. In contrast, when  the amulet acts as a seal it is performing protection or authentication to both the owner of the amulet and the receiver of the seal. Religious inscriptions either from the Quran or directional phrases would inform the amulets specific effect. Concise phrases written on an amulet are rare as it suggests a specific result for its user. In cases of non Quranic inscription, the nuance of the phrase would be capable of suppressing pain, aiding in well being, or healing the person to which it touches. More commonly Quranic verses or Shi’s Imams were inscribed as a vast form of protection. Early usage of the amulets are seen evident in various inscriptions of ‘praising god’, some dating back before the Bismallah Additionally the material of rock crystal amulets is extremely significant as it directly implements material connectivity to its function.

 Use of rock crystal in rain prayer amulets 
Calling down rain was one of many apotropaic capabilities attributed to amulets in the Islamic World. In the Fatimid Caliphate, rock crystal as a material may have been seen as particularly suited to endow amulets with this power. British Art Historian Venetia Porter, who has written extensively on this topic, argued that rain-prayer amulets would likely have been popular among the Fatimids due to the prevalence of droughts in that region, which had at times been disastrous. The association between the Fatimid rock crystal amulets and rain prayers is supported by the fact that such talismans occasionally feature references to rain and water in their inscriptions, which Porter cites as one of very few recurring elements or points of consistency among these objects. Ludvik Kalus was the first to draw attention to this connection. A rock crystal amulet featured in the collection of the Bibliotheque Nationale in France, cataloged by Kalus in 1981, is a notable example which is inscribed with an explicit call for rain. Kalus roughly translates the start of the first line as “bring down the rain to us.” The rest of the first line is left untranslated. The second line features a set of four letters whose significance is uncertain. The third and final line reads “bring down the rain.”",2025-03-24,['Art of the Fatimid Caliphate' 'Wikipedia Student Program'],"['al-Biruni' 'Ahmad ibn Usuf al-Tifashi' 'Fatimid Caliphate'

Nintendo Life rated the game 6 out of 10 stars, stating ""LEGO Ninjago: Nindroids feels like just another addition to the ever-expanding brick-based universe."" Gamereactor rated the game 3/5, stating that it lacks ""entertainment value while there are some positive bits.""

Ron DelVillano for Push Square rated the game 7 out of 10 stars, stating that ""Fans of the Ninjago construction sets and television series are sure to love being able to take control of their favorite heroes, but anyone simply looking for a new action adventure to play through may not be overly enchanted with this one.""

Lewis Brown for The Digital Fix rated the game 6/10, stating that ""Throw in other common Lego issues, such as an extremely boring hub side-game based on combat and you have to count Lego Ninjago: Nindroids very much as a missed opportunity.""

Brad L. for Digitally Downloaded stated that ""With its short but sweet levels, it makes sense for handheld gaming too, just don’t expect anything ground-breaking from this LEGO game."" Nintendojo rated the game D+, stating that ""LEGO Ninjago: Nindroids isn’t the worst LEGO game ever made, but it certainly could have used a lot of improvements to make the experience more enjoyable.""",2025-04-05,"['2014 video games' 'Lego video games' 'Lego Ninjago' 'Nintendo 3DS games'

It is designed to operate on Mars. Range with a fully charged battery would be  at an altitude of 1,000 meters. The aircraft features solar cells on its wings and fuselage. The total range per Martian year would be  – more than twice the circumference of Mars. Mars' atmosphere density is 6.35 mbar, 160x thinner than Earth's atmosphere at 1013.2 mbar.Air pressure noaa.gov During the southern winter, the global atmospheric pressure on Mars is 25% lower than during summer, because some atmospheric  freezes on the Martian polar ice caps. MAGGIE has a cruise lift coefficient CL of 3.5, nearly an order of magnitude higher than conventional subsonic aircraft, to overcome the low density of the Martian atmosphere.Solar system NASA MAGGIE's cruise Mach number is 0.25. Mach speed on Mars is  at ""sea level"", so cruising speed would be around  at elevation.

In January 2024, MAGGIE was one of thirteen proposals approved for Phase 1 funding by the NIAC.

462,54252,76529500,8504,Yutong U11DD,"The Yutong U11DD is a battery electric double-decker bus manufactured by Yutong in Zhengzhou since 2023, launched initially for the United Kingdom bus market in right-hand drive configuration.

Design
Announced in September 2022, the Yutong U11DD was developed extensively at Yutong's Zhengzhou manufacturing plant before the first demonstrators were shipped to the United Kingdom in June 2023. Externally, the U11DD shares design similarities with the tri-axle Yutong E12DD double-decker buses produced for Singapore's Land Transport Authority bus services in 2020, and carries a maximum of up to 84 passengers. Wheelchair and buggy spaces, as well as air conditioning, are provided as standard.

The Yutong U11DD is powered by a 220 kW permanent-magnet synchronous electric motor, and can be optioned with lithium iron phosphate batteries with a maximum charging capacity of either 385 or 442kWh. The bus shares electric driveline technology used in Yutong's other electric buses, such as the UK market's Yutong E10 and E9, allowing for a projected maximum range of up to  on a single charge.

Upgrades to the design and specification of U11DDs produced for the UK market, based on operator feedback, were announced by Yutong's UK distributor Pelican Yutong in October 2024 ahead of the 2024 Euro Bus Expo. A step in the lower deck gangway was replaced with a gently sloped floor, allowing step-free access up to the rear of the bus, with more headroom additionally created for passengers seated towards the rear. In the cab area, the cab door is held closed magnetically to reduce rattling, and electrically operated sunshields, handbrakes and steering wheel adjustment systems were added. USB chargers are specified as standard in the backs of each seat, stop bell buttons were wired to light up when pressed, and wall-mounted folding seats in the lower deck pull out gently.

Operators
Two demonstrators were first shipped to the United Kingdom for evaluation by bus operators in late 2023. The first operator to take delivery of U11DDs was Welsh municipal Newport Bus, a popular operator of electric Yutongs, who took delivery of two U11DDs in April 2024.

The first major order of U11DDs was placed by the FirstGroup, aided with funding from the central government Zero Emission Bus Regional Areas (ZEBRA 2) scheme in July 2024. The first 24 WESTbus-branded U11DDs were delivered to First West of England's Weston-super-Mare depot in March 2025, with further examples from an order for 74 set to enter service from the operator's Hengrove depot in south Bristol; further U11DDs from First's order for 127 U11DDs are set to be delivered during 2025 to First Essex and The Buses of Somerset for service in Basildon and Taunton respectively.

The McGill's Group's Xplore Dundee subsidiary took delivery of twelve U11DDs in March 2025, the first of the model to be delivered to a Scottish bus operator. Molesey independent coach operator Westway Coaches took delivery of a single U11DD, equipped with seatbelted leather seats, for private hire coaching work in September 2024, and AirSym of Heathrow took delivery of a former demonstrator on lease in early 2025 for use on tourist shuttle services to the Warner Bros.

Plot summary
The novel begins with a stranger hiring a man called Tigueron to assassinate the druid Drisker Arc, former High Druid of Paranor. We are then introduced to Tavo Kaynin, who reminisces about growing up with his sister and discovering the Wishsong magic they have. Tarsha has control of hers. Tavo's is more chaotic, and he destroys things with it when he loses his temper. After being implicated in the disappearance of a neighborhood bully, Tavo is sent to live with his uncle and warned not to use his magic. Two years later, Tarsha visits Tavo against her parents’ will. Tavo is living in a shed like an animal, something her uncle defends because Tavo is dangerous. Tavo sends her away. Tarsha determines to seek training from the druids, then return to help Tavo.

Meanwhile, Tavo murders his uncle, parents, and several others, tearing them apart with an explosive, and deadly form of Wishsong. He then sets out to find his sister Tarsha and murder her for abandoning him. Along the way he stops in a tavern and is hassled by some of the patrons. He murders everyone in the tavern. Tavo continues on his journey, haunted by those he has killed and Fluken, an evil imaginary friend, or possibly a split personality that encourages Tavo to do his worst.

In the north, an Army of Trolls is defeated by a mysterious army of soldiers that are able to disappear, allowing them to easily defeating the mighty troll army. The Druid council learns of this and the High Druid, Ober Balronen, sends druids Zia and Ruis to investigate. He sends the Druid High Blade, Darcon (Dar) Leah along as well, and asks that he report Zia and Ruis’ doings back to him. As they travel north, Zia reveals that she is no longer with Ruis, and that she loved Dar. Dar wonders if he still has feelings for Zia. They see the mysterious army, and Ruis demands to investigate on the ground alone despite Dar's warnings. While on the ground they are attacked by the mysterious enemy and Ruis is executed. The survivors flee into the mountains aboard their airship. The enemy pursues them and destroys their airship. Everyone dies except Dar, who leaps from the ship to a cliff face and climbs down to safety. A mysterious white cloaked enemy sees him on the cliff face and can easily kill him, but after a tense standoff, lets Dar go.

Tarsha seeks out Drisker Arc near the town of Emberen, and after a display of her abilities, he agrees to train her. Her training is interrupted when Drisker is called away to help the Trolls. While he is away, assassins attack Drisker's cottage. Tarsha escapes with Drisker's two heavy volumes of spells and conjurings. A forest imp called Flinc helps her escape. When Drisker returns to find his cottage burned, Flinc tells him that Tarsha was killed. He quickly recants, and Drisker finds her drugged in the imp's home. Flinc had wanted to keep her. The assassins attack again, and Drisker kills several of them. He recognizes them as Orsis Guild and decides to seek them out. In the city of Varfleet a street orphan called Shea Ohmsford leads Drisker and Tarsha to the Orsis Guild where they find Tigueron. Tigueron describes the person that hired them to assassinate him and then Drisker breaks his neck.

A young man called Kassen Drue applies to train with the druids. He demonstrates an ability to disappear, and project an illusion of himself. He seduces a young Druid-in-Training called Allis, and she shows him the secret entrance into Paranor.

Dar returns to Paranor, reports what happened and suggests asking the Elves for help. Balronen is incensed and not only ignores that idea but banishes and exiles Dar from Paranor for his failure. On his way out he sees Allis and Kassen. A druid called Clizia Porse gives him his Sword of Leah and urges that he leave before it's too late and seek Drisker Arc.

Drisker and Tarsha go to Paranor, but the High Druid refuses to speak with them. Clizia Porse brings him up to speed on what has transpired, and gives him a scrye orb, with which Drisker can contact her. Drisker describes the man who hired his assassin, but she claims not to know of whom he speaks. Drisker and Tarsha then return to Emberen. Dar meets them at Driskers cottage. Drisker describes the man who hired his assassin to Dar and Dar tells him it sounds like Kassen Drue, a man with the power to disappear like the soldiers of the mysterious army in the north, who was recently admitted as a Druid-in-Training by Clizia Porse. Alarmed by this revelation, Drisker and Dar head back to Paranor. Tarsha strikes off on her own to find her brother. At a tavern, she is joined by a mysterious seer called Parlindru who predicts that three times she will love, three times she will die, and three times she will make a difference.

Back at Paranor Kassen murders Allis. Drisker asks Clizia Porse why she lied about knowing Kassen, but then Paranor is invaded by disappearing soldiers. Clizia convinces Drisker to help her retrieve the Black Elfstone and send Paranor into limbo. He doesn't trust her but agrees to this to protect Paranor. Dar leaves Drisker to fight the invaders that are inside Paranor slaughtering the druids. He attacks Kassen, but he disappears and escapes. Drisker retrieves the Black Elfstone, and then Clizia Porse scratches him with a poison that leaves him paralyzed.

 Reception 
Publishers Weekly wrote that ""the first volume of Brooks's quartet, which will bring this decades-old Shannara epic fantasy saga to a close, works best for readers at opposite poles: series devotees” familiar with the backstory, “and newcomers” alike.

Aidan Moher of Reactor writes that although Brooks has planned The Fall of Shannara to be the conclusion to the Shannara series, he may ""write more Shannara novels, just not ones that move the story forward chronologically."" Moher praises The Black Elfstone as ""a vintage Shannara novel"" that ""proves that 40 years later, [Brook’s has] still got it. It has epic scope, heroic characters, and so much heart.""",2025-03-28,"['Shannara novels' '2017 American novels' 'High fantasy novels'

Owiny rose to prominence as a military leader, amassing a private battalion of more than 150 troops and conquering the entire region of Lango. He was so skilled in javelin that he would throw a spear at a thin line of rope from a distance and would hardly miss. In a singular engagement known as the Battle of Minakulu, Owiny achieved a significant victory in the battle of Minakulu, where he defeated the Acholi and seized the area between Kamdini and Bobi in present-day Gulu District.

 Early life 
Owiny Akullu was born in 1845 in Acutanana, Kamdini sub-county, Oyam District to Ogwang Akota and his wife. Akullu grew up to become a formidable military leader. He was able to assemble a private battalion of over 150 troops, with whom he successfully conquered the entirety of Lango.

 Military contribution 
Owiny Akullu is indeed remembered for his military contributions to the resistance against British colonial forces in Uganda. He was a prominent commander and ally of Omukama Kabalega, the former King of the Bunyoro kingdom, who British colonial rule. Akullu fought alongside Kabalega and supported his resistance efforts until Kabalega's capture in 1899, which marked a significant turning point in the colonial conquest of Bunyoro. His legacy lives on as a symbol of resilience and resistance against colonial oppresion in Uganda.

 Legacy 
Owiny died in 1947 at the age of 102. In 2019, a statue commemorating Owiny Akullu was erected in Kamdini sub-county, Oyam District, Uganda, to recognize his role in resisting colonial rule. Owiny Akullu is celebrated as a local hero for his contributions to the fight against colonialism, and this statue serves as a tribute to his legacy and impact on Ugandan history.",2025-03-01,['Lango people' '1845 births' '1947 deaths' 'People from Oyam District'],"['Uganda' 'Kamdini' 'Oyam District' 'Minakulu' 'Kamdini' 'Gulu District'

467,4690,359848,8268,Conrad Kain,"Conrad Kain (10 August 1883, Nasswald – 2 February 1934, Cranbrook, British Columbia) was an Austrian mountain guide who guided extensively in Europe, Canada, and New Zealand, and was responsible for the first ascents of more than 60 routes in British Columbia. He is particularly known for pioneering climbs in the Purcell Mountains and the first ascents of Mount Robson (1913), Mount Louis (1916) and Bugaboo Spire (1916).

 Life 

Kain was born in poverty in a small village in Lower Austria. His father was a miner who died when Kain was 8. In his youth he worked as a goatherd in the Rax Alps and from 1898 to 1904 he worked at stone quarries in Veitsch and Hirschwang. His free time he spent climbing, and by 1904 he guided his first clients, becoming an officially recognized professional guide in 1906. He guided his clients not only in Austria (including the Dolomites), but also in Switzerland and France, including the Matterhorn, La Meije and several first ascents.Timetable of Kain's life at www.conradkain.com.

Dissatisfied with his life in Austria, he planned to emigrate and in 1908 he took lessons in English in Vienna for that purpose. In June 1909 he moved to Canada with the promise of employment as the Alpine Club of Canada's first professional guide, changing his name from Konrad to Conrad. In the summer of 1910 he surveyed the Purcell Mountains and in 1911 he explored the Banff area, making a number of first ascents already. In 1912 he joined an exploration in Siberia's Altai Mountains, after which he returned to Austria where he spent several months with his mother. He then traveled to New Zealand where he was a guide in the winter of 1913. He was encouraged to return to Canada again to be a guide for two mountaineering camps, one based at Lake O'Hara camp and another at Robson Pass.  The next three years he would guide respective summers in both Canada and New Zealand, completing many first ascents in both countries.

Conrad Kain is credited with 69 first ascents in Canada alone, including Resplendent Mountain and Whitehorn Mountain (1911), Nasswald Peak (named after his hometown) and Mount Robson (1913), Mount Farnham (1915), Mount Louis, Howser Spire and Bugaboo Spire (1916), North Twin Peak and Mount Saskatchewan (1923), Mount Hooker and Mount Fraser (1924) and Peyto Peak and Trapper Peak (1933). Between 1914 and 1916 he made about 30 first ascents in New Zealand as well.Bob Mckerrow , Conrad Kain - New Zealand mountaineer or world mountaineer ?

While he considered his climb of Bugaboo Spire the most challenging, and it was considered the most difficult alpine climb in Canada until the 1940s, his most notable first ascent was that of Mount Robson in July 1913. He guided :de:Albert MacCarthy and William Wasbrough Foster over the northeast face by hacking hundreds of steps and famously told his clients at the top ""Gentlemen, that's so far as I can take you."" During the ascent, Kain was under the assumption that Mount Robson had been climbed in 1909 by George Kinney and Curly Phillips, but on their return to the campsite at Robson Pass, Phillips, who was outfitter of the expedition, revealed that he and Kinney had actually fallen short of reaching the summit in their heroic effort over the west face four years before.Jane Lytton Gooch, Mount Robson: Spiral Road of Art, Rocky Mountain Books, 2013, .

Conrad Kain climbed Mount Louis for the last time on his 50th birthday. He fell ill in October of that year in Wilmer, British Columbia, and died six months later of encephalitis in a hospital in Cranbrook. The marker on his grave in Cranbrook reads ""A guide of great spirit"".

Legacy

Kain wrote an autobiography titled Where the Clouds Can Go where he describes his tough years while growing up in Austria as well as his 25 years working variously as a guide for The Alpine Club of Canada, a hunter outfitter, and an assistant to Arthur O. Wheeler for the Geographic Survey of Canada.

In 1911, A. O. Wheeler named Mount Kain after him, when Kain had pointed at the mountain and exclaimed ""Ach, that is my peak!"" a few days after he had come to Wheeler's rescue after slipping on a descent from Lynx Mountain.Lytton Gooch, p. 62Other sources (which?) state that J. Monroe Thorington named the mountain after him only in 1934. Near the Bugaboos there is the Conrad Group, with the Conrad Icefield, Conrad Glacier and with Mount Conrad (3271 m)  as highest point. The latter previously unclimbed peak was the last mountain Kain climbed (in September 1933). Since 1970, the Alpine Club of Canada maintains an alpine hut named Conrad Kain hut centrally located in the Bugaboos, where Kain made many first ascents. In New Zealand there is also a Mount Conrad (2,598 m) named after him, lying in the Liebig Range above the Murchison Glacier in the Southern Alps.J.M.T., Conrad Kain, 1833-1934 In Memoriam, American Alpine Journal Vol 2, p.236 (1934)

To commemorate the 100th anniversary of Kain's arrival in Canada, the Conrad Kain Centennial Society was formed in the upper Columbia Valley in 2007 to celebrate his achievements and to develop legacy projects in his memory.",2025-01-16,"['1883 births' '1934 deaths' 'Alpine guides' 'Austrian mountain climbers'

471,50899,369223,21798,Mike Foster (American politician),"Murphy James Foster Jr. (July 11, 1930 – October 4, 2020) was an American businessman and politician who served as the 53rd governor of Louisiana from 1996 to 2004.

Early life and career

Murphy James Foster Jr. was born in Franklin, the seat of government of St. Mary Parish. His father, also named Murphy James Foster, was an area sugar planter and owner of oil and natural gas lands, whose own father was Murphy J. Foster Sr., who was Louisiana governor from 1892 to 1900 and a U.S. Senator from 1901 to 1913. 

Foster attended public high school in Franklin, graduated from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge in 1952 with a Bachelor of Science in chemistry, and Southern University Law Center with a Juris Doctor in 2004, the year he left the governorship. He became an Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America in 1946 and was a recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award. He was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Zeta Zeta chapter) and The Friars.  He joined the Air Force and served in the Korean War. By the time Mike Foster entered politics, he had already become a wealthy sugar planter and owner of a construction firm.  He resided at Oaklawn Manor, an antebellum plantation mansion in Franklin.

Election as governor, 1995

Foster entered the 1995 gubernatorial race as a minor candidate whom most local political observers discounted. Then in September 1995, Foster announced he would qualify for the race as a Republican.  The Republicans had not coalesced on a candidate, and Foster's announcement that he was switching parties vaulted him from single digits in the polls to serious contention.  Foster rode a wave of popular dissatisfaction with the more unsavory aspects of the casino gambling that had been legalized under outgoing Governor Edwin W. Edwards.  Foster came out strongly against gambling and pledged to run Louisiana ""like a business.""   His conservative platform included attacks on welfare abuse, gun control, affirmative action, racial quotas, and political corruption.

He carried the endorsement of the columnist and former Republican presidential candidate Patrick J. Buchanan.""Pat Buchanan endorses Louisiana's Mike Foster"", Minden Press-Herald, October 11, 1995, p. 1.

Foster edged out two more well-known candidates for a seat in the runoff with then-United States Representative Cleo Fields from Louisiana's 4th congressional district, a prominent black Democratic politician.  Future U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu ran third and missed the general election berth by just 8,983 votes (0.6 percent of the total votes cast). Former Governor Buddy Roemer, seeking a gubernatorial comeback, came in fourth place.  Foster's embrace of the Republican label and his conservative platform undercut Roemer, another Democrat-turned-Republican.

Reminiscent of his grandfather's inauguration virtually a century earlier, Mike Foster's inauguration ceremony on January 8, 1996, occurred at the Old State Capitol. Always a man of few words, Foster remarked briefly about the historicity of the occasion and made cordial statements about outgoing four-term Governor Edwin Edwards, who was present.

Foster defeated black Democratic candidates in both of his campaigns for governor—Cleo Fields in 1995 and Congressman William Jefferson of Louisiana's 2nd congressional district in 1999. He defeated Jefferson in a landslide, avoiding a runoff with 64 percent of the vote. His second inauguration took place on January 10, 2000.

Tenure as Governor

Foster was widely seen as having favored business to a greater degree than had previous governors. He retained the secretary of economic development, former legislator Kevin P. Reilly Sr. of Baton Rouge, the former CEO of Lamar Advertising Company of Baton Rouge. He ended state affirmative action and set-aside programs, which earned him the support of the business community but prompted protests from civil rights groups. Foster also targeted tort reform and ended the practice by which trial lawyers could seek punitive damages from businesses. Foster had close relations with the statewide pro-business lobbying group Louisiana Association of Business and Industry (LABI) for most of his tenure, though there were short-lived tensions in 2000 over Foster's attempt to raise business taxes in an effort to secure funding for higher education. By the end of his second term, Foster was receiving criticism for his reluctance to take business trips in order to attract businesses and jobs to Louisiana, and for enrolling in part-time law school classes while still in office. He also appointed then 24-year-old Bobby Jindal, later a two-term Republican governor, as head of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals.

As his executive counsel, Foster appointed the Democrat Cheney Joseph Jr. (1942–2015), a member of the LSU Law School faculty and a former district attorney for East Baton Rouge Parish.

Foster worked to re-organize the state's community college system by creating the Louisiana Community and Technical College System, and expanded the Tuition Opportunity Program for Students (TOPS). Foster instituted mandatory standardized testing for grade advancement in a move described by his administration as an effort to make public schools more accountable. He made increasing teacher salaries a major priority, at one point promising to stop cashing his paychecks until teachers' salaries reached the Southern average. Andy Kopplin served as Governor Foster's chief of staff.

In 1997, Foster named former state budget director Ralph Perlman as secretary of the Louisiana Gaming Control Board, a position that Perlman held for five years while in his eighties.

Despite having run on an anti-gambling platform, in office Foster became a quiet supporter of the gambling industry.  His advocacy of a bailout bill for the Harrah's casino in New Orleans helped ensure the passage of the measure.

Atchafalaya Basin Program

In November 1996 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers requested that Foster appoint a lead agency to coordinate state participation in the Atchafalaya Basin Project. Foster chose the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources as the lead agency. In December 1996, the Atchafalaya Basin Advisory Committee was created, members appointed, and planning initiated that resulted in the Atchafalaya Basin Master Plan, as authorized by the U.S. Congress. -Master plan A result of this plan was the creation of the Sherburne Complex Wildlife Management Area-Sherbuurne Complex map (Section 4.41-B) that includes the partnership of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF), and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The area consists of , and is managed by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.

Foster and David Duke

In his 1995 campaign, Foster paid more than $150,000 for former Ku Klux Klansman David Duke's mailing list of supporters. After failing to report the purchase as a campaign expenditure, Foster became the first Louisiana governor to admit and pay a fine for a violation of the state's ethics code. Foster insisted that he did not need to report the expenditure because he paid Duke with his personal funds and did not utilize the list in his campaign. Duke also endorsed Foster in the 1995 campaign.La. Campaign Finance Opinion No. 99-360

Post-governorship

In retirement, Foster lived with his wife, Alice Cosner Foster (1940–2025), the daughter of the late Hubert and Vira Surles Cosner, to whom he was married for forty years, on the family estate near Franklin.

In 2003, Foster was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield. In 2013, the state agreed to fund $2 million to renovate part of Franklin City Hall to provide housing for Foster's papers.Sam Hanna Jr., ""Fitting Tribute to Mike Foster"", Minden Press-Herald, November 6, 2013, p. 4

On September 28, 2020, news reports confirmed Foster entered hospice care.

After spending a week in hospice care, Mike Foster died on October 4, 2020, at the age of 90.

There are knowing, snide stabs at the music business, pop culture, and their co-generationalists."" The Orlando Sentinel concluded that ""cleverness rarely requires sincerity... It does require something more to carry an album though."" Robert Christgau noted that, ""where formerly Tim Quirk spoke his lyrics in tune, now he mocks, expostulates, kid-drawls, projects, so that sometimes they sound smarter (and sassier) than they read."" The Los Angeles Times wrote that ""they're at least as funny as Mojo Nixon desperately wants to be, and 20 times as tuneful.""

Trouser Press opined: ""Sharpening both instrumental skills and songwriting wit, TMJ hit their stride on Son of Sam I Am, an accomplished rock album."" The New York Times determined that ""songs like 'Worse' and 'Clowns' ... capture paranoia, kitsch overload, frustration, and the shrug that allows them to live with it all."" The Edmonton Journal said that ""there's much more than bratty kitsch and a spunky garage band beat going on with this cheeky foursome."" The State appreciated that ""there's plenty of teenage angst, but not one discouraging note amongst these power chords.""

AllMusic wrote that ""most of the songs are sweet-and-sour power pop.""

474,10843,75287651,14426,Munich Studio of Chicago,"The Munich Studio of Chicago was a stained-glass window company that operated in Chicago from 1903 to 1932. It was founded by German stained-glass artist Max Guler.

 History 
Munich Studio of Chicago was established in 1903, by German immigrant artist Max Guler (1870–1937). Guler studied China painting in his native town of Munich and had arrived in Chicago in 1896. He and his two partners, salesman L. Holzchuh and manager/bookkeeper Denis Shanahan, formed a soon-successful firm that hired numerous artisans and eventually made windows for probably 150 churches throughout the Midwest, until the Great Depression arrested church construction and put the company out of business in 1932. Guler and his key artisans thereafter worked for the Drehobl Art Glass Company of Chicago (still in business today), and Guler died in 1937.""Illinois Deaths and Stillbirths, 1916-1947"", FamilySearch (https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:NQ7T-WGJ  : 25 April 2022), Max Guler, 1937.

Guler was a highly gifted designer of windows. According to Drehobl's son: “Guler was a short, stout man whose greatest enjoyment was to sit at his drawing board dreaming of new ways to express a Biblical event or quotation” in “pictorial windows beautifully grouped in rich, gorgeous colors.” Guler was also proficient in creating and painting windows, although he usually left that work to his master artisans, including: Peter Kugel, who specialized in portraits and flesh tinting; Herman Schulze, who painted landscapes, floral designs, cloth textures and drapery folds; and George Wieroeder and Joseph Lazar, who cut, fired and leaded the glass. These men worked together to execute Guler's beautifully detailed pencil drawings and watercolor renderings.

Guler's rich colors were achieved by hand-painting sections of glass (from France, Germany and the US) with glass paints: ground glass mixed with iron oxide, yellow stain and other colorants; then firing the painted glass in a kiln. Windows made with this detailed painting are known as Munich-style stained-glass, or Munich windows.

Munich Studio windows are characterized by the use of:

 rich jewel colors
 detailed painting of realistic details and convincing depictions of wood, stone, skies and botanically accurate plants
 architectural framing using depictions of pilasters resembling Gothic-style stone towers edging the sides, and ornate architectural canopies of pointed Gothic spires above the scenes that indicate the importance of the figures (much as fabric canopies identified royal persons in Renaissance paintings) and fill the tall vertical space of each window
 perspective: Unlike simple, flat scenes in Medieval windows, Munich Studio windows portray depth through the use of perspective painting, with some figures at forefront, others behind them, and often arched stone windows, beyond which distant landscape scenes can be glimpsed outside, a device commonly employed in Italian Renaissance and Baroque paintings.
 Asymmetric placement of figures that adds movement to the scene, directing the eye from top to bottom and side to side

 Structure 
The iliac fossa is bounded above by the iliac crest, and below by the arcuate line. It is bordered in front and behind by the anterior and posterior borders of the ilium.

The iliac fossa gives origin to the iliacus muscle. The obturator nerve passes around the iliac fossa. It is perforated at its inner part by a nutrient canal. Below it there is a smooth, rounded border, the arcuate line, which runs anterior, inferior, and medial.

When the ""left"" or ""right"" adjective is used (e.g. ""right iliac fossa""), the iliac fossa usually  means one of the inguinal regions of the nine regions of the abdomen.

476,31165,5334828,17189,Alama Ieremia,"Namulauulu Alama Ieremia (born 27 October 1970) is a New Zealand rugby union coach and former international player for Western Samoa and New Zealand.

Early life
Ieremia was born in Sinamoga, a suburb of Apia, Samoa. He was educated in Samoa at Addington Primary School in Christchurch, New Zealand and later at Samoa College. He returned to New Zealand in 1991 to study geography at Victoria University, where he began playing rugby.

Playing career
Ieremia played provincial rugby with Wellington between 1992 and 2000, which included a National Provincial Championship title in his final season with the club. He played Super Rugby with the Hurricanes from its inaugural season in 1996, with Alama having the distinction of scoring the first ever try in Super rugby, against Auckland Blues in Palmerston North - Auckland Blues went on to win the match 36–28. The Hurricanes finished 9th at the end of the season. Alama's best season came in 1997, when the Hurricanes made it to the Semi finals haven finished third at the end of the Regular season. However the Hurricanes went down to the ACT Brumbies 33–20 in Canberra. Ieremia was a regular selection for the Hurricanes, forming a reliable and formidable midfield partnership with Jason O'Halloran.

In 2001, Ieremia moved to Japan to play for Suntory Sungoliath, which included a season as captain, before returning to New Zealand in 2004 after retiring from playing rugby.

International career
Ieremia began playing international rugby in 1992 for the national side Western Samoa. He made his debut on 13 June at Apia Park against Tonga, with Western Samoa winning 22–17. He earned 5 caps for Western Samoa, his last coming against the All Blacks at Eden Park on 31 July 1993, New Zealand winning 35–13, with the match being the first official international between the two countries.

With the lack of eligibility regulations in rugby before the professional era, Ieremia haven proven himself at Super Rugby level, was selected for the All Blacks in 1994. Ieremia's promotion to the All Blacks was rapid, due to the shock 2–0 series loss to France in June 1994. He was subsequently introduced for the three tests against the Springboks, playing at second five eighth with Frank Bunce, another who had been blooded by Samoa at test level, outside him at centre.

Ieremia was named in the All Blacks squad for the 1995 Rugby World Cup, but played only the pool match against Japan, where he also scored his first ever international try. For most of 1995 and 1996 the All Blacks' preference was for Walter Little as Bunce's partner and it was only an injury to Little that gave Ieremia his first extensive run as a regular test selection in 1997. An injury sustained during the 1998 Super 12 ruled him out of All Black selection that year, but he returned in 1999, and for the first part of the international season, he was used mainly at centre but for the bulk of the 1999 Rugby World Cup later in the year he was back at second five.

In 2000 he was again an All Black first choice, mainly again as a centre. Ieremia, a cheerful, articulate personality, was a strong, incisive runner and at 1.87m and 100 kg an imposing and powerful defender. He also had well developed skills and a solid boot. At his best, and when free from injury, he was one of the most consistently successful midfielders New Zealand rugby has had.

When he left New Zealand rugby at the end of the 2000 season to take up an overseas contract, Ieremia had played 40 matches for the All Blacks, including 30 tests.

Ieremia also represented Western Samoa at the 1993 Rugby World Cup Sevens and New Zealand at the 1997 Rugby World Cup Sevens.

Coaching career
After retiring from playing rugby in 2004, Ieremia took up a coaching role with Suntory Sungoliath, specializing as backs and attack coach. After two seasons in Japan, which saw Suntory make it to the final for the first time in over five years, Ieremia returned to New Zealand in 2007 as an assistant coach with the Wellington Lions.Joseph & Ieremia Join Lions He helped guide Wellington to their second consecutive final, only to lose to Auckland 23–14. He was later named as the WRFU Academy head coach, a position he held for a year.

On 25 September 2008, Alama Ieremia was appointed to the Hurricanes coaching team for the 2009 and 2010 Super 14 season. Ieremia earned the accolade of becoming the first former player to become part of the coaching staff of the team. In his first season as attack coach, he helped the Hurricanes to third in the regular season, before losing to the Chiefs in the semi-final 14–10. Despite this, the Hurricanes had scored more points than any other team of 380, their nearest rivals being the Blues with 339. The following year, saw the Hurricanes drop to eighth on the table, failing to make the play-off for the first time since 2007. When Colin Cooper left the side in 2010, Mark Hammett retained Ieremia as the attack coach for the 2011 and 2012 Super Rugby season. In 2012, he was praised in the media for bring through young All Blacks talent, and therefore was retained for a further 2 seasons. When Hammett left the club in 2014, Ieremia went with him, joining the Samoan national team as attack coach. His first game was a 33–14 loss to Japan. In February 2015, he was appointed interim general manager of Samoan rugby's high performance unit.

 Head coach of Samoa 
On 23 December 2015, he was named head coach of the Manu Samoa, taking over from Stephen Betham, who resigned after the 2015 Rugby World Cup.

A week later they went down to Fiji 26–16, before finishing their June internationals with a 30–10 victory over Tonga seeing Samoa finish second in the 2016 World Rugby Pacific Nations Cup. During the 2016 end-of-year internationals, Ieremia led Samoa to a single victory, beating Canada 25–23. The other tests saw Samoa lose to France 52–8 and Georgia 20–16.

In the 2017 mid-year internationals, Samoa lost all four games. This included a 78–0 loss to New Zealand, which was the first time since 1996 that Samoa had failed to score any points in a test match. The following week saw Wales defeat Manu Samoa in Apia for the first time since 1986, losing 19–17. The 2017 World Rugby Pacific Nations Cup saw Samoa finish in last place for the first ever time, this came following a first loss to Samoa since 2011, 30–26, and a historic win for Fiji in Apia 38–16. It was the first time since 2002 that Fiji had won in Samoa, and set a new winning margin in Samoa of 22 points.

Following a review following Samoa's June/July campaign, Ieremia resigned as Samoan head coach on 5 August. He left the post with a 20% win rate, just 2 wins from 10 matches.

 Family 
His parents were Johann von Waldstein (died 1576) and his second wife Magdalena of Vartenberg (died 1592). Like his father, Adam the Younger was married twice. His first wife was Elisabeth Brtnická von Waldstein (died 1614). His second wife was Johanna Emilie of Zierotin (died after 1633), the daughter of Viktorin of Zierotin. He had five sons with both wives: Rudolf, Maximilian, Bertold, Jan Viktorin and Karl.

 Life 

He came from an old Utraquist family but soon converted to Catholicism. He received a below-average education, but this did not prevent him from achieving considerable career success. He first established himself at the Rudolfinian court, where he became the Ober-Stallmeister in 1606, from 1608 served as the Oberstlandrichter, and in 1611 was promoted to the Oberstlandhofmeister. Adam gained a reputation as a conciliatory politician, a ""man of compromise"", which was evident both during the negotiations for the Letter of Majesty in 1609 and in the troubled times of 1611. The period of the estate uprising of 1618–1620 was an important test. He unsuccessfully tried to find common ground between the Estates and King Ferdinand II.. After that, he went into exile in Saxony after the election of Frederick of the Palatinate as King of Bohemia. After returning to Bohemia in 1621, Adam also participated in the purchase of confiscated estates and once again became Oberstlandhofmeister. At the same time, he acted in some cases in favour of his Protestant relatives. In 1627, he reached the pinnacle of his career in the office of Supreme Burgrave.

Although he never acquired such a magnificent fortune as his more famous relative Albrecht von Wallenstein (1583–1634), given that he managed to preserve the property for posterity, Adam's inheritance represented a crucial foundation for the family in the future.",2024-11-04,"['Waldstein family' 'Habsburg Bohemian nobility'

482,31496,5337719,4179,Medial epicondyle of the humerus,"The medial epicondyle of the humerus is an epicondyle of the humerus bone of the upper arm in humans.  It is larger and more prominent than the lateral epicondyle and is directed slightly more posteriorly in the anatomical position. In birds, where the arm is somewhat rotated compared to other tetrapods, it is called the ventral epicondyle of the humerus. In comparative anatomy, the more neutral term entepicondyle is used.

The medial epicondyle gives attachment to the ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint, to the pronator teres, and to a common tendon of origin (the common flexor tendon) of some of the flexor muscles of the forearm: the flexor carpi radialis, the flexor carpi ulnaris, the flexor digitorum superficialis, and the palmaris longus. The medial epicondyle is located on the distal end of the humerus.  Additionally, the medial epicondyle is inferior to the medial supracondylar ridge.  It is also proximal to the olecranon fossa.

The medial epicondyle protects the ulnar nerve, which runs in a groove on the back of this epicondyle.  The ulnar nerve is vulnerable because it passes close to the surface along the back of the bone.  Striking the medial epicondyle causes a tingling sensation in the ulnar nerve.  This response is known as striking the ""funny bone"". The name funny bone could be from a play on the words humorous and humerus, the bone on which the medial epicondyle is located, although according to the Oxford English Dictionary, it may refer to ""the peculiar sensation experienced when it is struck"". Medial epicondyle fracture of the humerus are common when falling onto an outstretched hand.

 Fractures 
Medial epicondyle fractures are common elbow injuries in children. There is considerable controversy about their treatment, with uncertainty about whether surgery to restore the natural position of the bone is better than healing in a cast.

""La gatta"" () is a 1960 song written and recorded by Gino Paoli.

 Background  
Initially, the single was a resounding fiasco, selling only 119 copies in about three months. In the following months, without any promotion and thanks to word of mouth it eventually proved to be a surprise hit and Paoli's breakthrough, selling up to over one hundred thousand copies in a week.

The song is a nostalgical autobiographical portrait of Paoli's simple, bohémien life in his small apartment in Boccadasse, Genoa. According to Paoli, the cat represented ""all my hopes, my romanticism, my desire to look up in the air, to look at the sky"". In 2012, Paoli adapted the song in an illustrated book for children.

 Cover versions 
Artists who also recorded the song include Ornella Vanoni, Gianni Morandi, Little Tony, Róisín Murphy, Skip Battin and Carla Boni. In 2011, Paoli recorded a new version of the song titled ""La chatta"" in a duet with Daniele Silvestri for Silvestri's album S.C.O.T.C.H.

486,55135,76548588,11197,Käte Selbmann,"Käte Selbmann (; 17 February 1906 – 5 April 1962) was a German politician who played a key role in the early development of the women's policy of East Germany. A member of the central committees of the Socialist Unity Party and the Democratic Women's League, she also served as a member of the Volkskammer from 1950 until 1954.

 Biography 
Käte Selbmann () was born in Berlin on 17 February 1906. Her father was a railway inspector. Selbmann attended the state-run women's schools in Droyßig and Halle, where she trained as a teacher. She later worked as a clerk and secretary. Selbmann joined the Young Communist League of Germany in 1923 and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1929. Selbmann was the head of the municipal children's home in Leipzig from 1929 until 1931, when she was dismissed for taking part in a protest. Following the Nazi seizure of power, Selbmann was arrested and held in protective custody from March to April 1933. After her release, she worked at a cardboard factory in Gotha. Selbmann was arrested again in 1935 and sentenced to fourteen months in prison for conspiracy to commit high treason by the Higher Regional Court of Dresden. She was released in 1937. From 1942 until 1945, she worked as a private teacher.

In 1945, following the end of World War II, Selbmann became part of the sub-district leadership of the KPD in Gotha. The following year, she joined the newly-formed Socialist Unity Party (SED) and became the secretary of the Leipzig branch of People's Solidarity. She was also the secretary of the SED branches in West Saxony and Leipzig. Selbmann joined the Democratic Women's League of Germany (DFD) in 1947, becoming the chairwoman of the Saxony branch and a member of the federal executive board in 1948. Later that year, she became a personal assistant to Walter Ulbricht, the future leader of East Germany.

As an SED member of the DFD's executive board, Selbmann declared in July 1948 that the DFD would promote women's roles in factories. At factories that already had high numbers of female workers, such as the Olympia-Werke factory, the DFD engaged in tasks typically reserved for trade unions, such as promoting legislation and social improvements. This eroded into the base of the Free German Trade Union Federation (FDGB) and caused tensions between the two organizations; the SED supported the DFD as a way to assert its hegemony over both organizations by keeping them at odds with each other. Selbmann later expressed frustration at the DFD's position in society, arguing it was ""a pre-school for women, neither as central as the FDGB nor even more important than any other mass organization to women's work, and absolutely subordinate to the SED"".

Selbmann was named the head of the women's department of the SED central committee in 1949, succeeding Maria Weiterer. She was selected for this position in part because of her husband, the prominent politician Fritz Selbmann, and in part because the SED considered her ""more pliable"" than her predecessors. As the head of the department, she developed the SED's women's policy and exerted control over the activities of the DFD. Historian Valerie Dubslaff writes that ""the role of the department was therefore neither to represent the interests of women nor to promote them within the party, but to execute the political will of its leaders"". In 1950, Selbmann was elected as a candidate member of the SED central committee, replacing .

In the 1950 East German general election, Selbmann was elected to the Volkskammer as a member of the DFD, representing Teltow and Potsdam. She resigned as head of the women's department in November 1952 due to serious illness, and did not seek re-election to the SED central committee or the Volkskammer in 1954. Selbmann became the head of the German Women's Council in 1957. She died in East Berlin on 5 April 1962.",2025-01-12,"['1906 births' '1962 deaths'

487,25036,5321363,9460,Shandong cuisine,"Shandong cuisine (), more commonly known in Chinese as Lu cuisine, is one of the Eight Culinary Traditions of Chinese cuisine and one of the Four Great Traditions (). It is derived from the native cooking style of Shandong Province, a northern coastal province of China.

Features
Shandong cuisine is famous for its wide selection of material and use of different cooking methods. The raw materials are mainly domestic animals and birds, seafood and vegetables. The masterly cooking techniques include bao (爆; quick frying), liu (溜; quick frying with corn flour), pa (扒; stewing), kao (烤; roasting), zhu (煮; boiling), and coating sugar onto fruits with honey as the adhesive.

Styles
Shandong cuisine is divided into two sub-regional styles: Jinan and Jiaodong. Shandong cuisine is known for its light aroma, freshness and rich taste. It puts emphasis on two types of broths, light and milky. Both broths are seasoned with scallions and go well with the freshness of seafood.

 Jiaodong style, encompassing dishes from eastern Shandong: Fushan (a district of Yantai), Qingdao, Yantai and the surrounding regions. It is characterised by seafood dishes with a light taste.
 Jinan style, made up of dishes from Jinan, Dezhou, Tai'an and the surrounding regions. One of its features is the use of soup.

Influence
Although less available in overseas Chinese restaurants, Shandong cuisine is considered one of the most influential schools in Chinese cuisine. Modern cuisines in North China (Beijing, Tianjin and the Manchuria) are branches of Shandong cuisine, and meals in most Northern Chinese households are typically prepared using simplified Shandong methods.

During the Spring and Autumn period (770-221 BCE), there were 2 influential states, Qi and Lu. Both states, with mountains and fertile plains, were economically and culturally developed and had abundant aquatic products, grains and sea salt. Some of the earliest known descriptions of Chinese culinary methods come from the states. Yi Ya, a retainer of Duke Huan of Qi, was renowned for his culinary skill. Confucius (who was born in the Lu state) was quoted in the Analects as saying, ""One should not indulge overly in fine flour, or in kuai (a dish akin to carpaccio) that is sliced too thinly"". About food, he recommended: ""Do not consume food which looks spoiled, smells spoiled, is out of season, is improperly butchered, or is not made with its proper seasoning"".

The cuisine as it is known today was created during the Yuan dynasty. It gradually spread to northern and northeastern China. In Beijing and Tianjin, it influenced Imperial cuisine. Shandong cuisine is primarily made up of Jiaodong and Jinan dishes.

Ingredients
Although modern transportation has increased the availability of ingredients China, Shandong cuisine remains rooted in tradition. It is noted for its variety of seafood, including scallop, prawn/shrimp, clam, sea cucumber and squid.

Maize
In addition to seafood, Shandong is unique for its use of maize, a local cash crop not widely cultivated in northern China. Unlike the sweet corn of North America, Shandong maize is chewy, starchy and often has a grassy aroma. It is served as steamed (or boiled) cobs, or the kernels are removed from the cob and lightly fried.

Peanuts
Shandong is noted for its peanuts, which are fragrant and naturally sweet. Large dishes of peanuts (roasted in the shell or shelled and stir-fried with salt) are common at meals, and they are served raw in a number of cold dishes from the region.

Grains
Shandong uses a variety of small grains. Millet, wheat, oats and barley can be found in the local diet, often eaten as congee or milled and cooked into a variety of steamed and fried breads. People in Shandong tend to prefer steamed breads rather than rice as a staple food.

Staple vegetables
Despite its agricultural output, Shandong has not traditionally used the variety of vegetables seen in southern Chinese cooking. Potatoes, tomatoes, cabbages, mushrooms, onions, garlic and eggplant are staple vegetables, with grassy greens, sea grasses and bell peppers also common. The large, sweet cabbages grown in central Shandong are known for their delicate flavour and hardiness; a staple of the winter diet in much of the province, they appear in many dishes.

Vinegar
Shandong's greatest contribution to Chinese cuisine is arguably its vinegar. Hundreds of years of experience and unique local methods have led to the region's prominence in Chinese vinegar production. Unlike the lighter, sharper types of vinegar popular in the south, Shandong vinegar has a complexity which some consider fine enough to stand alone.

Subgroups of Shandong cuisine
 Jinan cuisine (): The cooking methods of Jinan cuisine focus on quick frying, roasting and boiling. Jinan-style food is generally sweet, aromatic, fresh and tender. A famous dish from Jinan is stir-fried large yellow croaker with sugar and vinegar ().
 Jiaodong cuisine (): Jiaodong cuisine focuses more on cooking and cutting skills. The Jiaodong area is located close to the sea, so most raw materials are seafood. Sea cucumber, abalone and scallop are common in this area. A famous Jiaodong dish is stir-fried sea cucumber with scallions ().
 Kongfu cuisine (): ""Kongfu"" refers to the descendants of Kong Qiu (Confucius). The Kong family have high standards for the quality of every dish. Therefore, for every dish, Kongfu style emphasizes rigorous slicing skills during preparation and elegance when served.
 Luxinan cuisine (): ""Luxinan"" refers to southwestern parts of Shandong Province. Local people like foods made of natural ingredients; they occasionally flavor dishes with Chinese herbs.",2025-01-05,['Shandong cuisine' 'Regional cuisines of China'],"['Chinese cuisine' 'Shandong Province' 'province' 'China' 'Jiaodong'

489,13573,75367346,12444,Cantata for the University Graduation Ceremonies of 1894,"The Cantata for the University Graduation Ceremonies of 1894 (in Finnish: ; sometimes called the Promotional Cantata of 1894 (in Finnish: ) for short), JS 105, is a three-movement cantata for soprano, baritone, mixed choir, and orchestra written in 1894 by the Finnish composer Jean Sibelius. It is chronologically the first of Sibelius's nine orchestral cantatas, and belongs to a series of three such pieces—along with the Coronation Cantata (JS 104, 1896) and the Promotional Cantata of 1897 (JS 106)—that he wrote on commission from his employer at the time, the Imperial Alexander University (today the University of Helsinki).  

The cantata premiered on 31 May 1894 in Helsinki with Sibelius conducting the Helsinki Orchestral Association and an amateur choir; the soloists were the Finnish soprano Aino Ackté and the Finnish baritone Abraham Ojanperä.

In 1896, Sibelius arranged the conclusion of Movement II as the Festive March () for mixed choir .

Instrumentation
The Promotional Cantata of 1894 is scored for the following instruments and voices, organized by family (vocalists, woodwinds, brass, percussion, and strings):

Soprano, baritone, and mixed choir ()
2 flutes, 1 oboe, 2 clarinets, and 1 bassoon
2 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, and tuba
Timpani, bass drum, cymbals, and triangle 
Violins (I and II), violas, cellos, and double basses

Structure

The Promotional Cantata of 1894 is in three movements. They are:

Movement I is scored for mixed choir and orchestra, while Movement II adds to these forces solo parts for soprano and baritone. Finally, Movement III is for soprano and orchestra, although the solo part (which occurs during a brief, middle trio section) has not survived; however, according to the Sibelius biographer Andrew Barnett, ""luckily the lack of a solo part does not render the piece unperformable [as a movement for orchestra alone]"".

The cantata remains in manuscript, although will eventually be published as part of the Jean Sibelius Works (JSW) critical edition, an ongoing collaborative project between the National Library of Finland, Breitkopf & Härtel, and the Sibelius Society of Finland. (Begun in 1996, the series is projected at 52 volumes and will eventually cover all of Sibelius's completed original compositions and arrangements, including relevant JS-designated works.)

Discography
The Finnish conductor Leif Segerstam and the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, joined by the Finnish Philharmonic Choir, made the world premiere studio recording of the first two movements of Cantata for the University Graduation Ceremonies of 1894 in April 1999 for Ondine; the soloists were the Finnish soprano Soile Isokoski and the Finnish baritone . To date, the only other recording dates to August 2004; it is by the Finnish conductor Osmo Vänskä, the Lahti Symphony Orchestra, and the , who recorded the piece for the Swedish label BIS Records. Importantly, Vänskä was the first to record what survives of Movement III (again, the soprano part is lost). The table below contains additional details about these two recordings:

In addition, the Finnish choral director Astrid Riska and the  made the world premiere studio recording of the Festive March for mixed choir  in the spring of 1992 for Ondine. The table below lists this and other commercially available recordings:

492,37204,76052096,8562,Connie Zehr,"Connie Zehr (born 1938) is an American installation artist whose work involves sand, clay, glass, and sculpture. Most notable for her mounded sand installations, one of Zehr's sand installations was exhibited at the 1975 Whitney Biennial. Additionally, Zehr's work is included in the Archives of American Art at the Smithsonian.

Early life and education
As a child, Zehr was raised on her grandfather's Amish farm in Indiana. Her grandfather's farm was called Sand HiIl, a place where she played in dirt and sand as a child which she credits to her continued use of earth materials in her practice. Zehr often shares a memory of when she was 6 years old receiving gifts at Christmas. She recounts that her mother received colored pencils while Zehr received perfume. She remembers distinctly saying that she should have received the colored pencils because she was ""an artist.""

At 16 years old, and while in high school, Zehr lived in India for a short time while her father was there on a Point 4 program. While in India she helped a local artist in her studio. She credits this experience with being her first introduction to what an artist does. On their way back home to Ohio, Zehr says the family travelled through Europe visiting museums. 

Zehr studied briefly at Michigan State University before transferring to Ohio State University, noting finances as the reason for the transfer.  

In 1960, Zehr earned her BFA degree from Ohio State University.  

While at Ohio State, Zehr met fellow sculptor David Elder who was a Teaching assistant in one of her courses and whom she married upon graduation. 

Early career
In 1964, while pregnant with her first child, Zehr and her husband moved to Los Angeles where she found a community of artists working with unconventional materials and experimentation which would later define the Light and Space Movement. Zehr mentions her contemporaries at the time, Barry Le Va, Allen Ruppersberg, Robert Irwin, and Judy Chicago, using ""a variety of materials in unusual ways."" Zehr embraced this experimental process, dabbling in several emerging movement including earth art, conceptual art, feminist art, Op Art, and Minimalism. Her installation works at this time were complex, but minimal, focusing on the use of silica sand in vast temporary exhibits.

Zehr mentioned seeing and being inspired by one of Judy Chicago's Smoke pieces as the first time she saw a work of art that was ephemeral and ""relied on your visual memory."" Zehr also credits being inspired at this time by an installation of talcum work by Barry Le Va.

Zehr's first exhibition was held at Mount San Antonio College in the late 1960s and was called ""Mound Fields"", consisting of mounds of sand that people could walk amongst and between.

Mid career
In 1975, Zehr was invited to be part of the Whitney Biennial where she exhibited a large, elongated mound of sand. 

In 1982, Zehr began teaching art at the Claremont Graduate University in Southern California while continuing to exhibit nationally and internationally. While at Claremont, Zehr began to expand her installation practice by incorporating glass into her temporary installations.

Later career
In 1987, the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery (Los Angeles, California) held an exhibition retrospective of Zehr's work where in its 10,000 sq ft. space, she recreated installations of her six major sand works.

In 1997, ten years later, the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery again held an exhibition of Zehr's work where over the span of three months, she created three new installations.

After teaching at Claremont Graduate University during 1982–2009, Zehr retired as a Professor Emeritus.

In 2010, Zehr left California and moved to Horseheads, New York.

Installation process
Zehr considers her installations as paintings with the floor being a large canvas. Before conceptualizing her installation, she needs to know the traffic flow of the room and where the doors are located because she says she prefers people to be able to walk around her installations. In her early work, Zehr would often create a grid on the floor using tape to mark the mounds and establish the work's diameter. Often she marked the major elements and then went back to fill them in.

Zehr mentions never using tools to create her installations and equates this decision with being a ""feminine"" decision based on women ""being practical people, hav[ing] to do things by themselves."" Her work is scaled to her own body.

Exhibitions
Zehr's installation exhibitions have been created nationally and internationally in numerous galleries and museums, including creating on-site installations in museums and galleries nationally and internationally, e.g.: The Museum of Contemporary Art (Chicago, Illinois); The Whitney Museum of American Art (New York City, New York);  Taipei Fine Art Museum (Taipei, Taiwan); Pasadena Art Museum (Pasadena, California); Wadsworth Atheneum (Hartford, Connecticut);  Salvatori Ala Galeria (Milan, Italy); and university galleries.

It has received positive reviews from critics and was preceded by the singles ""For the Home"" and ""The Race Is On, the King Is Dead"".

Reception

Editors at AllMusic rated this album 3.5 out of 5 stars, with critic Fred Thomas writing that this album ""stands apart from the two records that preceded it by months as much as it carves out a new space for itself in the lengthy GbV saga that's been mutating since the early '80s"" and continuing that by ""the end, Nowhere to Go but Up grows more compositionally adventurous, but saves some catchiness for even its most complexly mapped songs"". At BrooklynVegan, Bill Pearis chose this for Album of the Week, stating that Nowhere to Go but Up ""finds the band wildly ambitious and totally up to the challenge"" and shows that the band has yet to peak and it was also shortlisted for one of the best albums of November 2023. Editors at Paste chose this for album of the week and critic Pat King rated it a 9.0 out of 10 for being part of ""the absolutely unprecedented winning streak Pollard and the current version of Guided by Voices have been on"" and stating that this is an ""essential"" entry in the band's discography, ending ""there really is no precedent for a band like Guided by Voices, or an artistic visionary like Robert Pollard"". It was also shortlisted for one of the ten best albums of November 2023. Editors at Pitchfork included this in a short list of albums to listen to for the week. Grant Sharples of Uproxx included this among the best indie music of the week, calling their 2023's studio albums a hat trick and looking forward to future releases by the band.

497,37764,76067059,4779,Dike Mountain,"Dike Mountain is a  glaciated summit located in the Boundary Ranges of the Coast Mountains, in the U.S. state of Alaska. It is situated  north-northwest of Juneau along the western side of the Juneau Icefield, on land managed by Tongass National Forest. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 1,150 feet (350 m) above the Eagle Glacier in . Neighbors include Mustang Peak  to the south, and Snowpatch Crag is  to the east. Dike Mountain was named by members of the Juneau Icefield Research Project in 1964, and the toponym was officially adopted in 1965 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names.United States Board on Geographic Names, Decisions on Geographic Names in the United States, Decision List No. 6502, (1965), page 3.

Climate
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Dike Mountain is located in a subpolar oceanic climate zone, with long, cold, wet winters, and cool summers. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Winter temperatures can drop below 0 °F with wind chill factors below −10 °F. This climate supports the West Branch Taku Glacier and Eagle Glacier surrounding the peak. The months May and June offer the most favorable weather for viewing this peak.

499,33036,75930829,5312,Walter Norris (footballer),"Walter Harry Norris (8 April 1863 - 14 May 1931) was an association football full-back who won the FA Cup in 1881 playing for the Old Carthusians.

Family and early life

Norris was born in Epsom and was the son of James Norris, a wealthy wine merchant, and Susanna; the family home was Castle Hill House in Bletchingly, and his father employed a number of servants.

He was educated at Charterhouse School, playing in the school's XI in 1880.

Football career

Although Norris played for the school as a goalkeeper, his career with the Old Carthusians started with him as a defender.  He made his debut for the O.C.s in fourth round of the 1880–81 FA Cup in the side's win at the Royal Engineers, as a late replacement for Herbert Somers-Cocks; his back play was described as ""beyond praise"".  Having established his place in the side, he played in the remaining rounds, and was notable in the final for silencing the Etonian forward line, being especially important as full-back partner Colvin was ""rather erratic with his kicks"".

Norris continued playing for the Carthusians in the competition until 1884–85; he had occasionally played in goal for friendly matches,(Relating to a match from 1882.) and took the position permanently in his last season.  He only played in two ties, a 5–3 win over Great Marlow in the third round and a 5–1 defeat to Blackburn Rovers in the semi-final; such was the dominance of the professional side that Norris had to make four saves in the first five minutes.  There is no record of him playing football again, but he continued to play for the Old Carthusians cricket side until 1891, usually as opening batsman.

Norris never earned an international cap; he was one of a number of reserves for England's 13–0 win over Ireland in 1882.  

Business career

Norris married Helen Mary White on 20 November 1894 at Caterham Parish Church; he was described as a brewer on the marriage certificate, which undersold that he was a director of the Brackley and Banbury Brewery, later known as Hopcraft and Norris Limited.

Norris died in Brackley in 1931, and was survived by his widow and his two sons, James and Graham, leaving a fortune of over £33,300 (£1.9m in 2024 terms).

He played in the 2007 AFC Asian Cup finals but this time the team failed to defend the title and finished 4th in the tournament.

On 14 February 2010, Nakazawa made his 100th appearance for the Japan national team against South Korea in the final match of the 2010 East Asian Football Championship at Tokyo National Stadium. Nakazawa becomes only the third Japanese player, following Masami Ihara and Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi, to reach 100 caps for his country. Later that year, Yasuhito Endo also reached 100 caps for Japan.

On 30 May 2010, Nakazawa scored an own-goal in a friendly match against England to give England the lead; his defensive partner Marcus Tulio Tanaka had already scored an own goal to draw England level with Japan. The match ended 2–1 to England.

In the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Nakazawa played all four of Japan's games on their way to the round of 16 and knockout by penalties to Paraguay.

504,52823,5394159,9952,Joe Kines,"Joe Kines (born July 13, 1944) is a former American football player and coach.  He spent most of his coaching career as an assistant in college football ranks, and twice serving as an interim head coach: in 1992 at the University of Arkansas after the firing of Jack Crowe after Arkansas's first game, and in 2006 at the University of Alabama after the dismissal of Mike Shula.

Early life
Kines was born on July 13, 1944, in a train car that was en route from Cedartown, Georgia, to Piedmont, Alabama. He holds both bachelor's and master's degree's from Jacksonville State University. Kines is married to the former Rubye Bell and they had one daughter, Susan Kines Langston, who was killed in a car crash on June 28, 2010, and two grandsons that survived the crash.

Coaching career
Kines began his coaching career at his alma mater, where he served as assistant coach and defensive coordinator through the 1976 season. In 1977, he received an offer to coach linebackers at Clemson University, where he coached for the next two seasons. In 1979, Kines became linebackers coach at the University of Florida under Charley Pell. There he spent two years as the linebackers coach, and was promoted to defensive coordinator in 1981. In 1985 and 1986, Kines was the defensive coordinator and inside linebackers coach at the University of Alabama before leaving with Ray Perkins to the NFL’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He served as the Buccaneers' linebacker coach from 1987 to 1990. Kines returned to college coaching in 1991 as the defensive coordinator at the University of Arkansas and was promoted to interim head coach of the Razorbacks in 1992 when Jack Crowe was fired following a season-opening loss to The Citadel. He guided the Razorbacks to a 45–7 victory over South Carolina in his first game after taking over for Crowe, and closed the season with a 30–6 rout of arch-rival LSU in the first game between the schools since the Cotton Bowl Classic following the 1965 season.

Kines was Arkansas’ assistant head coach and defensive coordinator from 1993 to 1994 under Danny Ford before moving on to the University of Georgia, where he served as the Bulldogs’ defensive coordinator from 1995 to 1998 and as assistant head coach in 1999. He also coached the defensive ends while at Georgia. In 2000, Kines left Georgia to become linebackers coach at Florida State University under head coach Bobby Bowden.

Kines returned as defensive coordinator at the University of Alabama in 2003 and remained in that position until head coach Mike Shula was fired on November 27, 2006. In 2005, he was named a finalist for the Broyles Award, given annually to the nation's top college football assistant coach. Kines was named interim head coach and guided Alabama in the Independence Bowl where they lost to Oklahoma State, 34–31. New Alabama head coach Nick Saban did not retain any of Shula's staff; however, Kines was hired as an officer with Tide Pride, which is responsible for helping to fund scholarships, generating revenue for capital improvements, and supporting the ""Million Dollar Band"", among other activities.

On February 13, 2008, Texas A&M head coach Mike Sherman hired Kines to be his defensive coordinator and assistant head coach. Kines initially did not show interest to the position, but after he exchanged words with Sherman in an interview, he accepted. Kines has called the Aggie defensive squad ""awful, and that's being real polite"" in the 2008 preseason. Aggie safeties coach Van Malone praised him as being a great communicator: ""He's one of the greatest communicators I've ever been around, and if you can communicate with them, that's all these kids want. He won't say a cuss word, but when you're not doing it the way he wants it, you feel like you've been cursed out."" Kines retired at the conclusion of the Aggies' 2009 season.

509,56921,5405950,23076,Super Monkey Ball Deluxe,"Super Monkey Ball Deluxe is a 2005 platform video game developed and published by Sega for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The game compiles all stages from Super Monkey Ball and Super Monkey Ball 2, as well as adding original levels. It is the first Super Monkey Ball game to not be developed by Amusement Vision, which rebranded during development. 

Super Monkey Ball Deluxe was well received, with critics praising the gameplay, but criticizing its audio and graphics. The game is notable for its large number of customizable party mini-games, also returning from the previous titles. It is also notable for the stages it had restored, which were previously cut from the originals.

Super Monkey Ball Deluxe's exclusive stages were remade as a part of Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania.

Gameplay

The gameplay is largely the same as the first two in the series. Much like the classic arcade game Marble Madness, the player must navigate a ball across many puzzling courses within a time limit, usually 60 seconds. The controls are very simple: the player uses the directional analog stick to move the entire floor in order to guide one of four anthropomorphic monkeys (encased in a large clear ball) towards the goal, while avoiding hazards and obstacles (for example, moving platforms, mazes, and ramps). Collecting bananas scattered throughout the stage raises the player's score, and awards extra lives. If the monkey ball falls off the edge of a platform or the time runs out, the player loses a life. If the player reaches the arch-shaped goal, the player finishes the stage and the player advances to the next stage. Higher levels have a greater challenge and complexity: most of the levels in Story Mode are characterised as Beginner, Advanced and Expert.

Main modes

The game has several game modes to play. The game's Story Mode is one player only, and features the same story mode featured in Super Monkey Ball 2. The plot involves the game's four protagonists, AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, and GonGon, who embark on a quest to stop the antagonist, Dr. Bad-Boon from stealing all the bananas on Jungle Island. It consists of ten worlds, each of which contains 20 levels, though only ten levels are required to be completed in order to advance to the next world. Players are allowed to select and complete levels in a world in any order they wish. A story cut-scene is played upon completion of a world. Unlike in Challenge Mode, the player has infinite lives.

Challenge Mode consists of 300 levels separated into sections based on difficulty level. Beginner difficulty has 40 stages, Advanced difficulty has 70 stages, Expert difficulty has 100 stages and Master difficulty has 20 stages. Each difficulty level also has 20 extra stages (with the exception of Master difficulty, which only has ten). This game also has an exclusive mode known as Ultimate, which tests the player's skill through every stage through the Beginner, Advanced, Expert and Master difficulties (if the player goes through the stages without continuing). Players are given three lives and five continues, but can get more lives by playing the game more. This mode can also be played with up to four players. The game also features a multiplayer mode known as Competition Mode, which allows up to four players to compete against each other on any of the maps unlocked in Challenge Mode. The same rules from the single-player Story Mode apply. The number of bananas a player collects determines which player is victorious.

Lastly, Practice Mode allows players to practice any of the unlocked levels from Story Mode or Challenge Mode. Whether failed or completed, the stage will replay indefinitely until the player quits.

Party games
Players can compete in a selection of mini-games known as ""party games"". All games are up to four players (which may include CPU controlled characters) and the player(s) may choose any of the four main monkey characters to play. All 12 party games from Super Monkey Ball 2 return in Deluxe, unlocked and available to play from the start. Available party games are listed below:

Monkey Race DX

In Monkey Race DX, the monkeys race around a course in their monkey balls and collect power ups to disrupt the opposition. The player wins by being the first to cross the finish line. This game mode can be played to up to four players. You can race on a single course on One Course Race Mode and you can enter a series races in the Grand Prix Mode. The player can also try to get the best time on a track in Time Attack Mode.

Monkey Fight DX

The aim of Monkey Fight DX is to knock off all the other monkeys on a stage. The monkeys have an extendable boxing glove to knock out other monkeys on the platform. The two modes are Normal mode where you get points for knocking monkeys out of the stage, and Survival Mode where the player has to remain on the stage to win. Players can also collect power ups that make knocking opponents off the stage easier.

Monkey Target DX

The aim of Monkey Target DX is to land on the target at the bottom of a steep ramp, scoring as many points as you can. The player rolls their monkey down a ramp to gain speed and momentum. When the monkey rolls off the ramp the player can open the monkey's ball which now acts as their glider. The player will eventually come across a landing pad where different areas of the platform have more points. The player can then land their monkey by turning their monkey's glider back into a monkey ball and they will be given the points allocated by the area where they have landed.

Monkey Boat

In Monkey Boat, the monkeys use their monkey balls as boats. The player can race on a single course in One Course Race Mode, race a series of races in Grand Prix Mode, or try to get the best time in a course in Time Attack Mode. The player must control the paddling of the boat to successfully move. The player can also get power ups in the course to sabotage their opponents with traps and weapons.

Monkey Shot

Monkey Shot is in the style of an old-school arcade shooter game. The player must shoot as many flying insects as they can while avoiding the missiles headed their way. The player can also find various bonus items either inside a ball or held by an enemy. In multiplayer mode, the winner is the player with the most points at the end of the stage.

Monkey Dogfight

Monkey Dogfight is a multiplayer combative game where the player must target and shoot the other players. The player's chosen monkey flies around a large plane using ""wings"" crafted from its monkey ball split in half. Ordinary bullets or lock-on missiles may be used to lower the enemy's health. When a player loses all their health, they respawn from the starting position. While each monkey has unlimited lives, the player who scores the most hits against other players is declared the winner.

Monkey Soccer

In the style of traditional 2-player soccer video games, Monkey Soccer is a five-a-side game on a small field, played for 60 seconds each half by default. There are four team types: normal, offensive, defensive and handicap. The game also includes Tournament and Penalty Kick Shootout modes.

Monkey Baseball

A baseball-type game for two players, Monkey Baseball has one player as batter with an oversized baseball bat, and another as ""pitcher"", who throws the entire monkey in its ball towards the batter. Instead of fielders, the pitch has a number of ""pockets"" at the edges which determine the effect of a successful bat (foul, out etc.) and ""jump fields"", which go up to block the ball from going in the pockets. The distribution of pockets and jump fields is determined randomly by a roulette at the start of the innings. A Tournament mode is also available.

Monkey Tennis

A singles or doubles tennis game for up to four players. The rules are largely the same as ordinary tennis. Depending on the return from the other player, the player may see a Smash Mark displayed on their side of the court. If the player stands on this mark hitting the ball, there will be a much more powerful return. A Tournament mode is available.

Monkey Golf DX

The rules of Monkey Golf DX are similar to Mini Golf. The player aims the monkey ball into a hole in each course. If the ball goes out of bounds, a one shot penalty is added and the player must take their next shot in the same position. After the player has taken at least nine strokes on any hole, the player is automatically forced to give up and receives ten points. This party game has two modes: Stroke play and Match play. In Stroke play, you play all the holes (nine or 18) and aim for the lowest score. This mode can be played up to four players and each player takes their shots in turn. Match Play involves two players playing a course for the lowest number of shots and the player who wins the hole will obtain the points. The player who wins the most games is the winner.

Monkey Bowling DX

The style of Monkey Bowling DX is similar to Ten Pin Bowling. This party game can be played up to four players. You can play Normal mode or two additional sets of rules: 9 Pins and Strike. The nine-pin rule is where there will be one pin missing in each lane. The missing pin will be counted towards the player's score and where the missing pin is placed will vary in each frame. Strike Rule has ten pins for each frame but you'll only have one throw each frame in a 20 frame game. There is also Special mode where each of the lanes will be oddly shaped. Challenge mode lets you select pin arrangement and give a limited number of tries to knock all the pins down.

Monkey Billiards DX

The style of Monkey Billiards DX is similar to the game Billiards. This game can be played for up to three players. The different rules that these party games can be played are US Nine-ball, Japan Nine-Ball, Eight-ball or Rotation. One player can also play Tournament mode where the player plays a series of games incorporating each rule system against the computer. Each player turn uses the cue ball to knock colored monkey balls into pockets. Which colored balls that the player can pocket depends on which rules that player is using. If the player pockets the cue ball or hits the wrong colored ball first then the player is given a foul, giving the opponent an advantage. If a player pockets the correct colored ball, the player is given another shot instantly.

Characters

Super Monkey Ball Deluxe features four playable characters: AiAi, MeeMee, Baby and GonGon. AiAi is the main protagonist and the only playable character in Story Mode. He is accompanied by MeeMee, his girlfriend; GonGon, his friend and former rival; and Baby, his and MeeMee's future child who travels back in time to aid them.

The game's main antagonist is Dr. Bad-Boon, an evil, genius scientist from the future. In the future world, he had fallen in love with MeeMee and asked her to marry him, but was rejected due to her marriage to AiAi. Subsequently, Dr. Bad-Boon went back in time before AiAi and MeeMee were married, and makes attempts to keep them from marrying. Dr. Bad-Boon in turn terrorizes the rest of the land's inhabitants as well. He also has a nameless assistant, who, no matter how badly Dr. Bad-Boon treats him, remains loyal.

Reception

Super Monkey Ball Deluxe has been given positive reviews, particularly for the Xbox version of the game. On the review aggregator website Metacritic, it has an average score of 81/100 for the Xbox version  and a 78/100 for the PlayStation 2 version. Another review aggregator website, GameRankings, gave similar results, with the Xbox version scoring an 80.48%  and the PlayStation 2 version scoring a 77.48%.

GameSpot gave both versions of the game 7.9/10 commenting that: ""The Monkey Ball series has always been about establishing a whimsical, energetic feel, and that still comes across in Deluxe."" 1UP gave the Xbox release of the game a B+ has citing that: ""If you enjoy and are up for the challenge, the adrenaline rush and controller-clutching is all yours"". Eurogamer, which gave the game a score of 8/10, noticed that the game's Story Mode is easier and the mini games are unlocked by default, which they think is: ""the developer's determination to open the game up to a much larger audience."" As a port of its previous games, GameSpy considers it as: ""the ""Director's Cut"" of the series, crammed with bells, whistles, and other trinkets of awesomeness"", giving it 3.5 out of 5 stars for the PlayStation 2 version of the game. G4TV, which gave the game a  score of 4/5 for the Xbox version, have commented that the game provides a lot of content for its retail price, expressing that it is ""A whole lot of monkey balling to be had for your buck"".

Critics have commented on the lack of online functionality as a missed opportunity, especially when it comes to multiplayer in the mini games. IGN, which gave the game an 8.4/10 on the Xbox, have said that: ""It boggles the mind to think of the possibilities of online Monkey Ball tournaments and leaderboards."" This publication has also criticized the sound effects, that they are ""almost abrasive and will quickly annoy anyone within hearing distance who isn't playing."" GameSpot has criticized the PlayStation 2 version's graphics as they ""don't feel as crisp as they did when they first arrived on the GameCube"". Critics have deemed the PlayStation 2 version of the game as inferior to the Xbox. GameSpy said the PlayStation 2 release ""suffer from the frankly ridiculous load times and slowdown"". G4TV have also commented that the game doesn't offer anything for fans of the Super Monkey Ball series, stating that: ""If you've played it before on GameCube, you've seen it all before"".",2025-02-10,"['2005 video games' '3D platformers'

514,29214,75802429,4139,Portrait of Marshal Blücher,"The Portrait of Marshal Blücher is an 1814 portrait painting by the English artist Thomas Lawrence of the Prussian Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher.Levey p.191 

Blücher was a noted military commander who had played a key role in the 1813-14 defeat of Napoleon's French Empire by a coalition of Allies including Britain, Prussia, Russia and Austria, culminating in the capture of Paris in April 1814. It was painted while Blücher was in London for the Allied sovereigns' visit to England, victory celebrations attended by the leaders of the allied nations including Blücher's monarch Frederick William III. Blücher was popular with the British public during his visit and in the euphoria that followed the victory he was frequently mobbed in the streets of the city. The following year he gained further success when he joined forces with the Duke of Wellington in the Waterloo Campaign to inflict the final defeat of Napoleon, who had escaped from Elba.

The work was commissioned by the Prince Regent for four hundred guineas. Blücher is shown against a warlike background in his field marshal's uniform, wearing a miniature of the Regent, the Prussian Iron Cross and Order of the Black Eagle, the Austrian Order of Maria Theresa and the Russian Cross of St. George, decorations of the four major allies who defeated Napoleon. In the background a Uhlan mounts his horse.https://www.rct.uk/collection/405148/field-marshal-gebhardt-von-blucher-1742-1819 

It was exhibited at the Royal Academy exhibition in 1815Gould & Nieuwenhuys p.285 and was possibly intended for Carlton House, the Regent's London residence. It remained in Lawrence's studio for some years before being hung in the newly-completed Waterloo Chamber at Windsor Castle where it remains today as part of the Royal Collection. The chamber features many other European leaders painted by Lawrence, many of them at the 1818 Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle. An 1814 portrait of the Russian general Matvei Platov serves almost as a rough companion piece to the artist's depiction of Blücher, featuring a similar pose. The composition of both seem influenced by Joshua Reynolds' earlier works, particularly his depiction of the Marquess of Granby.Levey p.190",2024-12-13,"['1814 paintings' 'Paintings by Thomas Lawrence'

History
Palasport Flaminio was built in two different sections: the first part, including only the swimming pool and a gym, was completed in 1972, while a second part, that includes the main sports hall, was officially opened on September 25, 1977. It immediately became the new home sports hall of Basket Rimini. The team, which was playing in Serie B at the time, achieved promotion to Serie A2 for the first time in its history at the end of that season.

Among the various disciplines, the arena was used also for handball: two different teams from the town of Rimini (Pallamano Rimini and Handball Club Rimini) were both competing in Serie A in those years.

At the end of the 1983–84 season, Basket Rimini obtained promotion to Serie A1, the highest-tier level of the Italian basketball league system. In the following years, the team continued to play mainly between Serie A1 and Serie A2. Multiple basketball champions played at Flaminio as opponents, such as Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame members Bob McAdoo, Oscar Schmidt, George Gervin, Dino Radja and Dominique Wilkins, as well as some NBA All-Stars including Mike Mitchell, Micheal Ray Richardson and Manu Ginóbili, and other great players like Darryl Dawkins and Toni Kukoč. Between 1998 and 2000, Basket Rimini qualified also for the FIBA Korać Cup, the third-tier level club competition in European basketball.

The arena also hosted concerts, especially during its first decades. James Brown and Ray Charles performed here.

The local basketball team (in the meantime renamed Basket Rimini Crabs) left the Palasport Flaminio in February 2003, moving to the new and more capacious 105 Stadium. They played in Legadue (the new name of Serie A2) at the new arena until 2011, then the club had economic problems and started again from the fourth highest league. Playing in the minor leagues, the team returned to play at the Palasport Flaminio.

A new club was created in 2018 under the name Rinascita Basket Rimini, which subsequently acquired the historic title of the Crabs. Through this new project, the team achieved two promotions in four years, therefore the Palasport Flaminio returned to hosting Serie A2 matches.",2024-10-10,['Indoor arenas in Italy' 'Basketball venues in Italy'],"['indoor sporting arena' 'Rimini' 'seating capacity' 'basketball'

The Titans' 1–6 record to start the season was their worst start since 2015. The team was eliminated from playoff contention for the third consecutive season after losing to the Jacksonville Jaguars 10–6 in Week 14. They failed to improve on their 6–11 record from the previous season after losing to the Cincinnati Bengals 37–27 in Week 15. The Titans ended the season with a record of 3–14 after losing to the Houston Texans 23–14 in Week 18, their lowest win count since 2015 and their most losses since 2014. The Week 18 loss also secured the Titans the first overall pick in the 2025 NFL draft. This season was also the first since 2014 where no Titans players were named to the initial AFC roster for the Pro Bowl.

This was the Titans' first season since 2015 without long-time running back Derrick Henry, who was not re-signed in the offseason and joined the Baltimore Ravens in free agency. Quarterback Will Levis started the majority of games throughout the season (12), but also shared starts with Mason Rudolph (5) due to injuries and performance issues.

Offseason

Coaching changes
On January 9, 2024, the Titans fired head coach Mike Vrabel after six seasons and a career record of 56–48 with the team. Vrabel had lost 18 out of the past 24 games dating back to the 2022 season and hadn't won a playoff game since the 2019 season. However, many still saw the move as a surprise and believed Vrabel to be a popular head coaching candidate for other teams.

On January 24, 2024 the Titans hired Cincinnati Bengals offensive coordinator Brian Callahan as their new head coach.

Game summaries
Week 1: at Chicago Bears

The Titans defense played an outstanding game, holding the Bears to just 148 yards of offense and no touchdowns; however, the Titans blew a 17–0 lead after giving up a blocked punt for a touchdown and quarterback Will Levis throwing a go-ahead pick six in the fourth quarter. With the loss, the Titans fall to 0–1 and lose their third straight season opener.

Week 2: vs. New York Jets

The Titans once again played a solid game on defense, but once again allowed a blocked punt and Will Levis continued to struggle with turnovers. With the loss, they fell to 0–2.

Week 3: vs. Green Bay Packers

Facing their former quarterback Malik Willis, the Titans struggled, allowing Willis to throw for 202 yards and a touchdown while also rushing for 73 yards and a touchdown. Meanwhile, Will Levis was sacked 8 times and threw another pick-six, dropping the Titans to 0–3 for the first time since 2009.

Week 4: at Miami Dolphins

The Titans get their first win of the season, albeit against an injury-plagued Dolphins down to their third-string quarterback. Levis notably injured his shoulder on a scramble during the first quarter, resulting in the first appearance of Mason Rudolph.

Kicker Nick Folk was also awarded AFC Special Teams Player of the Week after going five for five on field goals.

Week 6: vs. Indianapolis Colts

The Titans lost to their divisional rivals, dropping them to 1–4 for the season. Levis re-aggravated his shoulder after this performance, and would be sidelined for the next several games.

Week 7: at Buffalo Bills

This game marked Mason Rudolph's first start as a Titan, but they lost heartily to the playoff-bound Buffalo Bills.

Week 8: at Detroit Lions

Despite a competitive first quarter, the Titans were soon blown out in their biggest deficit of the season, dropping them to 1–6. The Titans especially struggled with special teams performance, giving up an astounding 262 total kick return yards, including a 90 yard touchdown on a punt return by former Titan Kalif Raymond.

Week 9: vs. New England Patriots

In a competitive battle led by Mason Rudolph, rookie quarterback Drake Maye was able to tie the game with a gorgeous last-second touchdown just as time expired, bringing the game into overtime. However, the Titans were able to seal the game with a field goal and an interception by Amani Hooker, bouncing back to 2–6 and finishing 2-2 against the AFC East. This was also the Titans' only home win of the 2024 season as well as their 3rd win in their last 5 games against New England since 2017.

Week 10: at Los Angeles Chargers

Levis made his return as starting quarterback after three weeks out on injury. Despite a decent performance by Levis, and his first game of the season without making a turnover, the Titans were not able to pull away with the win.

Week 11: vs. Minnesota Vikings

The Titans posted a strong performance against the highly ranked Vikings, but their success was spoiled by several high-impact penalties that erased a Titans touchdown and goal line stop that would have otherwise put the Titans ahead. The game featured a 98-yard touchdown pass to Nick Westbrook-Ikhine while Levis was backed up in their own end zone, tying the franchise record and becoming the league's longest pass of the season.

Week 12: at Houston Texans

The Titans were finally able to post a divisional win against the favored 7–4 Texans. Although the Texans were on the verge of tying the Titans in an exciting fourth quarter, a missed field goal and last minute safety brought the Titans to victory and a 3–8 record. This was the first (and only) full win of the season by a Levis-led offense as well as their only divisional win of the season.

Week 13: at Washington Commanders

Unable to preserve their momentum from last week's win, the team struggled with early penalties and fumbles, allowing the Commanders to blitz their way to a 28–0 lead early into the second quarter. Although the Titans were able to avoid a first half blowout and attempted to rally in the second half, they ultimately struggled to contain the dual-threat rookie Jayden Daniels, ending the day in a disheartening 19–42 loss.

Week 14: vs. Jacksonville Jaguars

The favored Titans fell against a Mac Jones-led Jaguars in an uneventful 6–10 loss. This game was the first of the season where the Titans were not able to score a single touchdown. The loss also eliminated Tennessee from playoff contention.

Week 15: vs. Cincinnati Bengals

After his fourth turnover, Will Levis was ultimately benched for Mason Rudolph in the third quarter, marking the first time Levis was sidelined for non-medical reasons. Rudolph was unable to mount a comeback, bringing the Titans down to 3–11 for the season. This game featured an astounding ten turnovers by the two teams (six by Tennessee, four by Cincinnati).

Week 16: at Indianapolis Colts

The Titans defense was gashed for 335 rushing yards, and despite a late rally, Tennessee fell 38–30 to Indianapolis, suffering their second consecutive season sweep by their rivals.

Week 17: at Jacksonville Jaguars

With the loss the Titans were swept by Jacksonville for the second time in the last three years. As a result, the Titans secured a last place finish in the AFC South for the second year in a row.

Week 18: vs. Houston Texans
With the 23–14 loss at home the Titans finish the season at 3–14, the worst record for the team since 2014, and lost their fourth straight home game against the Texans. The Patriots win over Buffalo ensured the Titans the #1 pick in the 2025 NFL draft.

Lin has been working for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1999 to 2020 and was dispatched to serve as party secretary and director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps from 2020 to 2024.

Biography
Lin was born into a military family in Wuhan, Hubei, in May 1977. Lin attended Wuhan Foreign Languages School for high school and graduated in 1995. He went on for undergraduate education and graduated from Beijing Foreign Studies University with a major in English in 1999. After graduation, he joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1999 and was selected to study abroad in Denmark. He was later assigned to the Political Office at the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the Kingdom of Denmark. Since then, he had served as political counselor at the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the Republic of Poland and as counselor at the Department of European Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China.

From 2020 to 2024, he was dispatched to serve as party secretary and director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps.

 Cyber attack accusations 
In March 2024, Lin accused the United Kingdom and the United States of ""political manipulation"" after both of these countries blamed a Chinese state-run cyber unit over an alleged cyber attack on Britain's electoral commission and Members of Parliament. He further added that both the US and the UK should ""stop politicising cyber security issues"".

 South China Sea 
During a visit of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Manila in March 2024, Lin told the US of having no rights to interfere between China and the Philippines' issues on the South China Sea. In April 2024, he said on a scheduled news conference that the Philippines should ""stop bringing external forces to safeguard its so-called security"" on disputed waters. He further stated that such showcasing of external forces shall provoke confrontations and aggravate tensions.

In May 2024, he expressed China's concerns over the deployment of a US-launched missile system as the US transports it to the northern region of the Philippines. In November 2024, Lin also claimed that the territorial dispute will not escalate if the Philippines no longer ""infringes and provokes"". This was his response to Filipino Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro's comments of China's ""ramping up pressure"" to the Philippines.

 US tariffs 
After the Biden administration announced new tariffs and additional import taxes on Chinese electric vehicles and goods, Lin made a statement saying, ""Instead of ending those wrong practices, the US continues to politicize trade issues, abuse the so-called review process of Section 301 tariffs and plan tariff hikes"".",2025-01-23,"['1977 births' 'Living people' '21st-century Chinese politicians'

Gooding School District was the first district in the nation to win the HealthierUS Challenge ""Gold Award of Distinction.""Gooding Elementary wins USDA award for healthArea school sets national bar for nutritional standards 

History

In the 1970s a group of parents from Bliss, located in the Bliss School District, sought to enroll their children in the Gooding schools. The Bliss district, beginning in 1975, decided not to permit certain parents to enroll children in the Gooding schools in a tuition free way, and in response the Gooding district denied the transfers since that district did not get tuition money. The Gooding district attempted to get the parents to pay tuition fees, and court involvement began in June 1976 after the district filed a lawsuit against those parents. Douglas Kramer, a court judge of the fifth district, ruled in 1978 that a school district is permitted to charge tuition, but that the district may not necessarily have to take that tuition from parents instead of other parties, and that the paramount question is what is the best case scenario for the student rather than the identity of the persons or groups paying the tuition.

In 2008, Heather Williams, the district superintendent, stated that the district worked together with the charter school North Valley Academy (VIA).

In 2009 the district leadership was deciding whether students should go to school for four days per week instead of five.

By 2009, the enrollment in the school district was down to 90% of the levels from before the opening of NVA.

531,16415,75446722,12637,2023 Givat Shaul shooting,"On 30 November 2023, two Palestinian gunmen killed three and wounded 16 Israeli civilians at a bus stop on the Givat Shaul Interchange in Jerusalem during the ceasefire of the Gaza war. A fourth individual, Yuval Castleman (an armed bystander who shot at the gunmen), was shot and killed by responding IDF soldiers who mistook him for one of the attackers. Hamas claimed responsibility for the shooting.

 Background 
The Givat Shaul neighborhood, located in the western part of the city, is one of the primary entrances to Jerusalem, and has been a target of attacks in the past. The 2023 shooting occurred within the context of the violent Gaza war, just hours after Hamas and Israel, the 2 primary belligerents in the war, agreed to the extension of a ceasefire.

According to Israeli Police, both attackers had been imprisoned in the past due to their affiliation with Hamas. Murad Nemer was imprisoned for 10 years because of his intention to carry out terrorist operations; his brother, Ibrahim Nemer was imprisoned in 2014 for the same reason. The men were both in their 30s and from the Sur Baher neighborhood of East Jerusalem.

 Attack 
According to the Israeli Police and amateur camera footage, the two gunmen, 38-year-old Murad Nemer and 30-year-old Ibrahim Nemer, arrived at the bus stop in a car at around 7:30 a.m. local time. They exited the car carrying an M16 and a handgun. The attackers' vehicle contained a ""large amount of ammunition,"" according to police. They then opened fire at the people waiting at the bus stop, killing 3 and injuring 16. Israeli police received reports of gunfire at about 7:40 a.m. local time. A bystander identified as 37-year-old Yuval Doron Castleman, who noticed the attack while driving, opened fire on the attackers during the shooting.

The attack ended when two IDF soldiers, including a soldier heading back to base after being on a break from service in Gaza, and Castleman, an armed civilian, returned fire, killing both gunmen. However, Castleman was shot by an Israeli soldier after being mistaken for an attacker. Despite throwing away his gun, kneeling, and raising his hands, he was shot again. As IDF soldiers assumed he was an attacker, Haaretz stated Castleman received no medical assistance after being shot. Castleman later died at the hospital.

 Victims 
Initial reports named the three dead by the attackers as 73-year-old rabbi Elimelech Wasserman, 67-year-old Chana Ifergan, and 24-year-old Livia Dickman. A fourth individual Yuval Doron Castleman was shot and killed by the responding IDF soldiers. Livia Dickman was pregnant and died at the scene of the attack. The fetus could not be saved. Wasserman and Ifergan were pronounced dead at the Shaare Zedek Medical Center. Six other people were transported to Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital, of whom three were in serious condition.

 Aftermath and reactions 
After an initial investigation, the Israeli Police confirmed the identities of the attackers as Murad and Ibrahim Nemer, as well as confirming the deaths and injuries. Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that ""The operation came as a natural response to unprecedented crimes conducted by the Occupation"".

The police conducted raids on the attacker's family's homes, arresting 6 members of their family. The highway on which the attack took place, Highway 1 at the Motsa Junction, was closed immediately afterwards. The US Ambassador to Israel, Jack Lew, and the EU Ambassador to Israel Dimiter Tzantchev, both condemned the attack on social media.

The family of Yuval Doron Castleman, the bystander who was mistakenly shot by IDF soldiers, labeled his death as an ""execution"" and called for a thorough investigation. The IDF, initially stating that it had no plans to investigate the incident, later decided to involve its Military Police's investigatory unit following an initial probe by the Shin Bet and Israel Police. Police acknowledged the mistaken identification and expressed sorrow for Castleman's death.",2025-04-15,"['Terrorist attacks in the Israel–Hamas war' '2023 in Jerusalem'

Born to Thai parents and raised in Pittsburgh, Nualkhair attended Bryn Mawr College, and moved to Bangkok in 1995. Previously a financial reporter for Reuters, Nualkhair covered the South Thailand insurgency, sustainable tourism, and regional cuisine. She publishes the Bangkok Glutton blog, is a contributor to the Michelin Guide Thailand, and is author of two Thai street food guidebooks and a Thai cookbook.

Nualkhair has commented extensively on the role informal street vendors play in the Thai economy. She criticized the 2017 Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) campaign to clear street food vendors from Bangkok's sidewalks, suggesting that more stringent zoning would diminish the creativity and innovation of the city's food culture. Citing the negative impact of COVID-19 on vendors, Nualkhair has predicted that reduced choices for consumers would diminish social cohesion and increase corporate consolidation of the food industry.

Nualkhair appeared as a guide in the Bangkok episodes of Street Food Volume 1: Asia and Somebody Feed Phil, and the ""Sweet"" episode of Confucius Was a Foodie, exploring desserts in Bangkok's Chinatown.

534,52516,5391506,23979,The Price Is Right (1956 American game show),"The Price Is Right is an American game show produced by Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions, wherein contestants placed successive bids on merchandise prizes with the goal of bidding closest to each prize's actual retail price without surpassing it. The show was a precursor to the current and best-known version of the program, which premiered in 1972 on CBS's daytime schedule. It makes The Price Is Right one of only a few game show franchises to have aired in some form across all three of the Big Three television networks.

The series, hosted by Bill Cullen, premiered on NBC's daytime schedule on November 26, 1956, and quickly spawned a primetime series that aired once a week. The Price Is Right became one of the few game shows to survive the rigging scandals of the late 1950s, gaining even more popularity after other game shows had been canceled when exposed for being rigged.

The show was sponsored primarily throughout its run by Unilever, then known as Lever Brothers Corporation, and the specific products that were often featured were Imperial margarine, Wisk laundry detergent, Handy Andy liquid cleaner, and Dove bath and beauty bar.

The four contestants of the week would usually receive a complimentary supply of Dove beauty bars.

An alternate sponsor was Speidel watchbands, notably their then-new Twist-O-Flex bands.

In 1963, The Price Is Right switched networks and both the daytime and primetime series moved to ABC. On September 3, 1965, the show aired its final episode after nearly nine years on the air.

Game play

On the original version of The Price Is Right, four contestants – one a returning champion, the other three chosen from the studio audience – bid on items or ensembles of items in an auction-style format.

A prize was presented for the contestants to bid on. A minimum bid was specified. After the opening bid, contestants bid on the item in turn with each successive bid a certain amount higher than the previous bid. A contestant could freeze their current bid instead of increasing it if they believed their bid was close enough to win. A later rule allowed contestants, on their opening bid only, to ""underbid"" the other bids, but it automatically froze their bid and prevented them from later increasing the original bid. Some rounds were designated as ""one-bid"" rounds, where only one round of bidding was held (the format used on the current version of The Price Is Right); sometimes the minimum-bid and higher-bid threshold rules also were waived.

Other than in one-bid rounds, the bidding continued until a buzzer sounded, at which point each contestant who had not yet ""frozen"" was given one final bid. Bidding also ended when three of the contestants had frozen, at which point the fourth contestant was allowed one final bid unless they already had the high bid. Cullen then read the actual retail price of the prize. The contestant whose bid was closest without going over the actual price won the item. If everyone overbid, the prize was not won; however, Cullen sometimes had the overbids erased and instructed players to give lower bids prior to reading the actual price (similar to what is done on the current CBS version and its syndicated spinoffs).

After most one-bid rounds, a bonus game was played, in which the winner of the one-bid prize would play a random game (such as wordplay or tune-matching) for additional prizes.

After a set number of rounds (four on the nighttime version, six on the daytime), the contestant who accumulated the highest value in cash and prizes became the champion and returned on the next show.

Home Viewer Showcases
The Price Is Right frequently featured a home viewer ""Showcase"", a multi-prize package for which home viewers were invited to submit their bids via postcard. The viewer who was closest to the actual retail price without going over won everything in the Showcase, but one item was sometimes handmade so the viewer could not check the price of all the items. The term ""showcase"" was later replaced by ""sweepstakes"".

Very often, home viewers were stunningly accurate with their bids, including several viewers who guessed the price correct down to the penny. In such a case, the tied contestants originally were informed via telegram and asked to give the price of a specific item and continuing until one broke the tie. Re-ties and all-overbids were thrown out. By the time of the ABC run, the tiebreaker changed so that the person who was first to send in the correct bid won the prize.

Home Viewer Showcases have also been featured on the CBS version, in 1972, 1978, annually from 1980 to 1987, 1990, and in 2011. Its format was unchanged through 1990, but the 2011 version, because of the advance in technology, changed to a ten-prizes-in-a-week format, with two prizes appearing per episode during the week. Each day the price of one of the prizes was revealed to the home audience, and the price of the second prize (which was in either of the two Showcases) was not provided. Instead of postcards, the bids had to be submitted through the show's website.Prize of the Week, March

Prizes
While many of the prizes on the original Price Is Right were normal, standard game show fare (e.g., furniture, appliances, home electronics, furs, trips, and cars), there were many instances of outlandish prizes being offered. This was particularly true of the nighttime version, which had a larger prize budget.

Some examples:
 A 1926 Rolls-Royce with chauffeur
 A Ferris wheel
 An Amphicar
 Shares of corporate stock
 An island in the St. Lawrence Seaway
 A Piper Caribbean airplane
 A submarine
 
Sometimes, large amounts of food – such as a mile of hot dogs along with buns and enough condiments (perhaps to go with a barbecue pit) – were offered as the bonus.

Some other examples of outlandish or ""exceptionally unique"" bonus prizes:
 Accompanying a color TV, a live peacock (a play on the NBC logo) to serve as a ""color guide""
 Accompanying a barbecue pit and the usual accessories, a live Angus steer
 Accompanying a prize package of items needed to throw a backyard party, big band legend Woody Herman and His Orchestra
 Accompanying a raccoon coat worth $29.95, a sable coat valued at $23,000
 A bonus prize of a 16'x32' in-ground swimming pool, installed in the winner's back yard in one day's time
 A bonus prize of a trip to Israel to appear as an extra in the 1960 film Exodus

In the early 1960s, the dynamic of the national economy was such that the nighttime show could offer homes in new subdivisions (sometimes fully furnished) as prizes, often with suspenseful bidding among the contestants.

In the last two seasons of the nighttime run, the series gave away small business franchises.

In some events, the outlandish prizes were merely for show; for instance, in one episode contestants bid on the original retail price for a 1920s car, but instead won a more contemporary model.

History
The Price Is Right was created and produced by Bob Stewart for Mark Goodson–Bill Todman Productions. Stewart already had created one hit series for Goodson-Todman, To Tell the Truth and he later created the enormously successful Password. In 1964, Stewart left Goodson-Todman to strike out on his own as a producer. (Frank Wayne, who later served as executive producer for the Barker version of The Price Is Right, took over Stewart's Password producer duties.)

Bob Stewart attributes the creation of The Price Is Right to watching an auctioneer from his office window in New York City, auctioning off various merchandise items.

In 1959, shortly after the quiz show scandal broke, most game and quiz shows lost their popularity rapidly and were canceled. The Price Is Right was an exception; Goodson and Todman had built a squeaky-clean reputation upon relatively low-stakes games. Thus, as the more popular competition was eliminated, The Price Is Right became the most-watched game show in the country, and remained so for two years.

ABC
When the series moved to ABC in 1963, three studio contestants – including the returning champion – played. The fourth chair was filled by a celebrity who played for either a studio audience member or a home viewer. If the celebrity was the big winner of the show, the civilian contestant who had the most winnings was considered the champion; it is unknown what would have happened in the event of a shut-out with the celebrity winning.

As Don Pardo was still under contract at NBC, he was replaced by Johnny Gilbert. Coincidentally, both Pardo and Gilbert also had long runs as announcers for another game show, Jeopardy!

When the show moved to ABC, several CBS affiliates took up ABC secondary affiliation to show The Price Is Right (especially if its market lacked full ABC affiliation), in part because of the still-high ratings the show enjoyed in daytime.

Goodson-Todman wanted The Price Is Right to be ABC's first non-cartoon color show, but the network could not afford to convert to color. This meant that the nighttime version reverted to black-and-white.

Afterward
After the success of The Price Is Right, To Tell the Truth, and Password, producer Stewart left Goodson-Todman in 1964. Stewart's follow-up to The Price Is Right, his first independent production, was The Face Is Familiar with Jack Whitaker as host. Later, Stewart created other successful shows such as Eye Guess, a sight-and-memory game with Bill Cullen as host, Jackpot! and The $10,000, $20,000, $25,000 Pyramid.

In 1972, Goodson-Todman proposed a reformatted version of the game. In the new version of the game, the auction rounds were eliminated, with every round becoming a one-bid round. The bonus games were reformatted as pricing games, as most involve the pricing of either the prize itself, grocery items, or small prizes under $100. Each winning bidder was removed from the game and replaced with another contestant, all of whom were drawn from the studio audience. A new round, borrowing the Showcase name, brought back the two biggest winners to bid on their own three-prize package, with the top winner choosing to either bid or pass on the first showcase in hopes of a better deal on the second. The pricing games, contestants from the audience, and the bid-or-pass on prizes hidden behind doors were all previously used on another hit game show of the era, Let's Make a Deal, and Goodson-Todman's first choice of host for The New Price Is Right, Dennis James, was Let's Make a Deal's regular guest host at the time. James would end up hosting five weekly seasons of The New Price Is Right in first-run syndication; when CBS picked up the show for daytime, it insisted that the show be hosted by Bob Barker, who hosted 35 seasons of daily episodes (plus three seasons of weekly syndicated episodes after James's retirement and several prime-time specials) until his retirement in 2007, after which comedian Drew Carey assumed hosting duties. Further alterations to the format were made in 1975 when the show expanded to a ""fabulous 60-minute"" time slot. Various other versions of The Price Is Right have aired over the course of American television history, including a daily syndicated version hosted by Tom Kennedy in 1985 and a radically altered version hosted by Doug Davidson in 1994; the latter was notable for eliminating the central conceit from the original series of bidding on prizes. Counting all incarnations, The Price Is Right has aired for more hours than any other nationwide game show in American television history.

Paul Alter, who directed the original version of the show, became the director of the current version in 1986, replacing Marc Breslow, who had been in that role since its start in 1972; he continued to hold the position until 2000.

Origin
The show originated from NBC's Hudson Theatre in New York City, also home to The Tonight Show and other NBC shows with a studio audience. A year later, after Abraham Hirschfeld bought the Hudson Theatre, the show moved to NBC's Colonial Theater at 66th and Broadway, with the Ziegfeld Theater used for a few shows as well. When the show moved to ABC, the Ritz Theater became the show's broadcast origination.

In addition to his hosting duties on The Price Is Right and his weekly appearances as a panelist on I've Got a Secret, Cullen also hosted a popular weekday morning radio show for WNBC in New York.

Substitute hosts

Over the eight-year run, various people sat in Cullen's place while he was on vacation.

 Sonny Fox (June 10, 1957; first substitute host; he was also Bud Collyer's ""designated"" substitute host on Beat the Clock through 1960; it went off the air at the end of January, 1961)

 Johnny Gilbert (June 19, 1964; Ed Jordan filled in as announcer)

Models
Throughout the nine-year run of The Price Is Right, the show also employed models, whose duties were similar to those of the models in the current version.

June Ferguson and Toni Wallace were the regular models, while Gail Sheldon also made frequent appearances. Ferguson, Wallace and Sheldon were featured during the show's entire nine-year run. Other models appearing included Beverly Bentley, Carol LaBrie, Carolyn Stroupe; various other models either assisted Ferguson and Wallace or appeared during their absences.

Announcers
During the NBC run, Don Pardo was the main announcer. Whenever he was off or filling in for Cullen as host, substitute announcers included Dick Dudley, Vic Roby, Edward Haeffor, Roger Tuttle and Johnny Olson, who would go on to announce the 1972 version until his death in 1985.

Following the move to ABC (due to Don Pardo being under contract to NBC), Johnny Gilbert became the announcer; two fill-ins were Johnny Olson and ABC staff announcer Ed Jordan.

Theme songs
The first theme song (used from 1956–1961) was an arrangement of Charles Strouse's ""Sixth Finger Tune"", originally written for Milton Scott Michel's 1956 play Sixth Finger in a Five Finger Glove.

The second theme song (used from 1961–1965) was called Window Shopping and was composed by Robert Cobert. This theme was later used on another Goodson-Todman game, Snap Judgment, and later found its way back to Bob Stewart's stable with the short-lived game You're Putting Me On.

Episode status
Although The Price Is Right became Goodson-Todman's first regularly aired game show to be broadcast in color on September 23, 1957, no color kinescopes or videotapes are known to exist from the nighttime run except for approximately 90 seconds preceding the debut of the Kraft Music Hall on television, broadcast on October 8, 1958, taken from a quad-tape recording made off the broadcast feed and discovered in 2024,Deadline.com, Feb 8 2024 and since made available on YouTube by the UCLA Film & Television Archive.

Many monochrome NBC nighttime episodes (plus at least one ABC episode) aired on Game Show Network from 1996–2000, at which time the network's contract to air the show ended; it has not been renewed since. The 1961 episode hosted by Francis aired on Buzzr on March 8, 2019 as an homage to International Women's Day; Buzzr added the program to its weekend lineup in September 2019, with its package also including episodes hosted by Merv Griffin.

Most of the daytime run is believed to be wiped; the UCLA Film and Television Archive lists the first and third episodes from 1956 among its holdings.UCLA Archive: The Price is Right  A few NBC daytime episodes with commercials intact, originally broadcast in the late spring/early summer of 1957, have been around the ""collector's circuit."" They are now available for viewing on YouTube.

Home media
Four episodes, including the 1964 nighttime finale, were released on ""The Best of The Price is Right"" DVD set (March 25, 2008). Despite pre-release assumptions that each of the four unique runs would be represented, as it was announced that there would be four Cullen episodes, none were of the ABC daytime run despite the existence of episodes from that era; a second NBC prime time episode instead filled that slot.

Many noticed that the four Cullen episodes lacked commercials, as well as the fact that all three NBC episodes had already been spotted prior to the DVD release. Both NBC primetime episodes (January 13 and 27, 1960) had aired on GSN before, while the daytime episode (February 21, 1957) had been available in the public domain for several years; the daytime episode is notable for not only missing its opening, but for Cullen promoting Charles Van Doren's match against Vivienne Nearing on Twenty-One – which eventually led to Van Doren's defeat.

The Fremantle logo animation was added after each episode, as the production company currently owns all Mark Goodson properties.

The episode listing included with the DVD set states the daytime episode aired March 10, 1957, and the ABC episode aired September 4, 1964 (with guest Jose Ferrer); however, the former actually aired on February 21, 1957, and the latter is not actually present on the DVD set but had been aired by GSN. The 1964 finale featured Pat Carroll as the celebrity player, and the night's champion was invited back to appear on the following Monday's daytime episode.

In popular culture
The December 1959 issue of MAD Magazine spoofed the show - and in particular its sometimes-outlandish prizes - with the parody feature ""The Price is All Right"". (Issue #51, pages 9 – 12.)

In a 1962 episode of The Flintstones, Barney Rubble is invited to be a contestant on The Prize is Priced, a parody of The Price is Right.  When it's his turn to bid, Barney says, ""I'll just put in my two cents, and–"" but before he's able to give his actual bid, his ""bid"" of two cents is locked in.

537,30290,75835418,18606,Anveshi Jain,"Anveshi Jain (born 25 June 1996) is an Indian actress, social media influencer, singer, and TEDx speaker. She gained recognition after her debut web series in 2019, Gandii Baat, which marked her entry into the Indian film industry.

 Early and personal life 
Anveshi was born on 25 June 1996 to a Jain family,  in Khajuraho, Madhya Pradesh. She studied electronics engineering at Rajiv Gandhi Proudyogiki Vishwavidyalaya and had thought of pursuing an MBA in Indore. She discontinued her MBA course before moving to Mumbai and gave several auditions over there to get a break into the film industry. Prior to getting work in Gandii Baat, she worked as a singer and emcee as well. Before bagging a role in that series, she was told to get in shape. As a result she went on a strict diet and did rigorous exercise for 90 days. She even took up acting workshops as well.  She mentioned that this was her one final attempt in this acting career and what she didn't forsee was the impact. She also mentioned that she played the role assuming that nobody would watch it since the series had bold sexual content and also requested the makers not to include her name in the credits.

In 2022, she revealed hitting puberty early, leading to a significant increase in breast size. At 14, her father imposed restrictions, requiring her to wear extra layers and salwar-kameez to cover her chest. She frequently faced objectifying comments and looks. When her lovemaking scene in that episode of Gandii Baat went viral right after it was released in January 2019, her relations with her family and loved ones were strained. She had to take a break from her relationship with her boyfriend as the role had taken a toll on her romantic relationship. She struggled to get rid of her erotic image but according to her therapy taught her to accept it rather than struggling to fight it. She mentioned that she embraced that image and started to use it for her benefit. Hence, she started sharing videos where she wore cleavage-baring blouses, short dresses or saree. However she said that she doesn't do erotic roles anymore. 

She also started to take up other assignments. She hosts events and gives motivational talks. During her live sessions on social media, she talks to her fans about anxiety, self-esteem issues and loneliness. On some days, she simply reads to them from the Kamasutra. She was invited to speak at the TEDx Talk event as well.

She also mentioned that whenever someone would ask her where she hails from and she would reply Khajuraho, she often receives a sly look as people would correlate her bold erotic image to her hometown which is known for temples having erotic sculptures.

 Career 

As an Actress 
In 2019, Anveshi got her first show Gandii Baat which gained her overnight success. In the first episode of second season she played a bisexual  village woman named Neeta. This was her sole appearance in the entire web series. The lovemaking scene between her and Flora Saini went viral and she gained fame overnight. Her Instagram following experienced a significant increase. After that, she reportedly became one of the most-Googled celebrities towards the end of 2019.

In June 2019, Anveshi launched an official app, through which she interacts with her fans through live sessions, shares unseen pictures, music videos, dating vlogs, and new shows. The app was inspired by a fan-created application that initially gained 40 thousand downloads in a single day. She made special appearances on BOSS: Baap of Special Services and Who's Your Daddy?. In 2020 she appeared in Lakshmikanth Chenna's Commitment, marking her Telugu debut. In the same year, she made her debut in Dhollywood with playing lead role in the film G. In 2022, Anveshi performed in an item number song in Ravi Teja’s film Ramarao on Duty called ""Naa Peru Seesa"" sung by Shreya Ghoshal. She also appeared in the web series Tera Chhalaava in the same year.

 Music videos 
In 2021, Anveshi ventured into music with the release of ""Jugnu"" on SpotlampE.

Early life
Hassan was born on 2 January 1958 in Chowk Bazaar area of Dhaka, Bangladesh.

In 1972, Hassan showcased his talent in an exhibition match, scoring two goals as Pogose School defeated Kamal Sporting Club 4–2. Impressed by his performance, Kamal Sporting's coach, Bazlur Rahman, offered Hassan the chance to play for Fire Service SC in the First Division.

Club career
After spending two seasons with Fire Service, coach Bazlur Rahman, fixed Hassan's move to Dilkusha SC in 1975. Hassan formed a lethal partnership with fellow striker Golam Shahid Neelu, as Dilkusha finished runners-up behind Abahani Krira Chakra, only on goal average.

In 1976, Hassan's mentor, Bazlur Rahman, sent him to Mohammedan SC. He started in only one game as Mohammedan clinched the First Division title. The following year, Hassan joined Old Dhaka-based Rahmatganj MFS, where he was a runner-up in both the Liberation Cup and First Division. Hassan even scored in the 1–3 defeat to Abahani, which ultimately decided the league title that year.

In 1978, Hassan joined the office club Team BJMC. In his debut season, he scored a hat-trick against PWD SC. However, it was the following year when Hassan hit his peak form. Tied to the club on a deal worth Tk 1.2 lakh, he scored a total of 12 league goals, including 6 goals in the Super League round, as BJMC were crowned champions. He even scored a hat-trick in the title-deciding game, leading BJMC to a 4–1 victory over Wari Club.

In 1980, Hassan captained Dhaka District to a runners-up position in the National Football Championship. In the same year, he suffered a major knee injury during the league-opening game against East End Club. Hassan soon became irregular on the field and eventually retired in 1984 while playing for Rahmatganj MFS.

International career
In 1978, Hassan participated in the 1978 AFC Youth Championship held in Dhaka, Bangladesh. On 10 October 1978, he scored the only goal as Bangladesh U19 defeated Yemen U19. The victory also marked the country's first at any age level on home soil.

547,56118,76589927,20468,HMS Renard (1909),"HMS Renard was a  (later G-class) destroyer of the British Royal Navy. The Beagles were coal-fuelled ships, designed for a speed of  and armed with a  gun and two torpedo tubes. Built by  Cammell Laird and launched in 1909, Renard was initially commissioned into the First Destroyer Flotilla at Portsmouth. In 1912, the warship joined the Third Destroyer Flotilla before being transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet as part of the Fifth Destroyer Flotilla in 1913. As the First World War approached, the destroyer was based in Alexandria Egypt, but was swiftly redeployed to Malta, followed, in 1915, by action in the Dardanelles Campaign. While serving with the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron and its successor the Aegean Squadron, as well as undertaking escort duties, the destroyer supported sorties by irregular troops against the Ottoman Empire. After the Armistice of 1918 that ended the war, Renard was initially transferred to the Nore and then sold in 1920 to be broken up.

Design and development

Renard was one of the s ordered by the Admiralty as part of the 1908–1909 shipbuilding programme for the Royal Navy. The bridge was larger and higher than previous designs and the vessels were coal-burning after concerns had been raised about the availability of fuel oil in time of war. This reduced costs, although it also meant that five boilers were needed, the extra machinery meaning that there was less space on the deck for equipment. The Beagle class vessels were not built to a standard design, with detailed design being left to the builders of individual ships in accordance with a loose specification, in this case Cammell Laird. In October 1913, as part of a wider renaming of the Royal Navy's warships into classes named alphabetically, the class was renamed as the G-class.

Renard was  long, with a beam of  and a draught of . Normal displacement was , which increased to  by the end of the First World War. Five Yarrow boilers fed direct-drive Parsons steam turbines driving three shafts. Two funnels were fitted. The machinery was rated at  giving a design speed of . During sea trials, the destroyer reached a speed of  at a displacement of . Up to  of coal was carried, giving a design range of  at . The ship had a complement of 96 officers and ratings.

Armament consisted of one  BL Mk VIII gun forward and three  QF 12-pounder 12 cwt guns aft. Torpedo armament consisted of two  torpedo tubes, one placed forward and the other aft. Two spare torpedoes were carried. On 8 April 1916, the Admiralty approved fitting the destroyer with depth charges. Two depth charge launchers and two charges were carried.

Construction and career
Renard was laid down at Cammell Laird's Birkenhead shipyard on 20 April 1909, launched on 13 November and completed during September the following year. The ship was the tenth of the name to serve in the Royal Navy, named after the sloop Reynard, a prize captured from the French Navy. Renard was also occasionally known as Reynard. The vessel was commissioned at Portsmouth and joined the First Destroyer Flotilla on 20 October. On 15 November 1911, Renard towed her sister ship  to port after that vessel had been damaged in a collision with the Danish schooner Fyn. The accident happened when the First Flotilla was returning to Harwich after exercises in the English Channel. Scorpion was holed close to her engine room while Fyn sank.

In 1912, a reorganisation of the Home Fleet resulted in the ships of the Beagle class forming the Third Destroyer Flotilla. Renard was recommissioned at Sheerness on 3 September and joined the flotilla at Chatham. The vessel remained part of the Third Flotilla in March 1913. Along with the rest of the class,Renard was transferred to the newly-formed Fifth Destroyer Flotilla as part of the Mediterranean Fleet in November.

As the First World War approached, Renard was part of the First Division of the Fifth Flotilla and based in Alexandria. The destroyer sailed to Malta, joining the rest of the flotilla on 9 August. The island had a coal shortage, which restricted the vessel's activity. On 6 August 1914, the destroyer was deployed searching for the German warships  and  but this was curtailed by a lack of fuel. In 1915 Renard participated in the naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign with the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron. The presence of large minefields across the narrows of the Dardanelles straits impeded the British and French forces attempting to assault the Ottoman forces. On 3 March, along with sister ships  and Scorpion, the destroyer escorted trawlers attempting to clear the minefields. The following day saw the destroyer again join other members of the class in escorting the troopship , carrying soldiers to land at Kumkale. On 25 and 26 June, the destroyer was one of five, including sister ship , that undertook minesweeping in the Dardanelles. Despite heavy fire, the ships achieved their objective in what Rear Admiral John de Robeck, commander of the squadron, described as ""a most satisfactory manner"". At the end of the campaign, the destroyer helped in the evacuation of troops from Cape Helles.

Renard stayed with the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron into 1916. The year saw an intensification of submarine action by the Imperial German Navy in the Mediterranean Sea and an increasing demand on destroyers as escorts. In February alone, fifty ships, totalling , were lost. Due to a lack of resources, the destroyers in the Mediterranean Fleet could only escort high value ships, like troopships. The ship also saw other duties, including supporting raids on the Ottoman Empire. On 24 July, the destroyer, as part of a small detachment that also included the monitor  and a minesweeper, escorted 172 irregular troops on a raid near the cities of Mytilene and Smyrna, the current İzmir. Despite being bombed by an aircraft of the Ottoman Aviation Squadrons, they returned with 3,200 sheep and other animals.

The destroyer remained a member of the Fifth Destroyer Flotilla within the Mediterranean Fleet. As the following year opened, the need for destroyer escorts increased dramatically as the German navy introduced unrestricted submarine warfare. By June, the submarines were sinking  of shipping a month. In response, the Admiralty introduced convoys on major routes, including those between Malta and Egypt, although Renard was still called upon to escort occasional single high-value ships as well. On 20 January the following year, Renard accompanied the   escorting a tanker. At this point, the destroyer was deployed as part of the Second Detached Squadron of the squadron, now renamed the Aegean Squadron, based at Pyrgos on the island of Imbros.

After the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended the war, the Royal Navy quickly withdrew all pre-war destroyers from active service. By February 1919, Renard had been transferred to the Nore. However, that deployment did not last long. As the force returned to a peacetime level of strength, both the number of ships and personnel needed to be reduced to save money. Declared superfluous to operational requirements, Renard was retired, and, on 31 August 1920, sold to Ward at New Holland to be broken up.

When comparing the sequence of MiDCA1 to that of the PLA2 family, the most significant similarities were identified with MICNI A (77.7%), MICNI B (73.3%), both derived from Micrurus nigrocinctus, and NAJMO (71.5%), obtained from Naja mossambica. The homology of the Ca2+ binding loop and the catalytic site was most conserved between these three toxins, with a 95% shared identity.

In contrast to many other PLA2 toxins, which have been found to create dimeric structures, MiDCA1 exists as a monomer. This protein has a molecular weight of 15,552 Da (~15 kDa) and consists of 120 amino acid residues. 

Its primary amino acid sequence is as follows:

The protein structure of MiDCA1 is characterized by the presence of seven regions, which include:

 N-terminal region
 Calcium binding loop
 Catalytic site
 Anticoagulant site
 β-wing loop
  Neurotoxic site
 C-terminal region or domain

Within the PLA2 family conserved regions close to the calcium-binding loop, which are the neurotoxic loop and the β-wing, are related to binding with muscle (M)-type or neuronal (N)-type PLA2 receptors, resulting in neurotoxic effects. Various modifications have been identified, such as the residue Lys86, which is prominently located within the neurotoxic site of MiDCA1 and plays a crucial role in the structural modification of the neurotoxic loop. Moreover, it has been revealed that Lys76 is actively involved in the modification of the β-wing loop. The intricate interplay between the Lys76 and Lys86 residues significantly impacts the potency of MiDCA1. Specifically, modification of the β-wing loop and alternation of the neurotoxic loop by Lys76 and Lys86 respectively reduce the region's hydrophobicity, affecting the toxin's potency with M or N-type receptors.

 Target and Function 
MiDCA1 functions as a specific, reversible blocker of potassium channels, specifically targeting Kv2.1 channels at nerve terminals. The blockade of these channels impedes the repolarization of the neural membrane, resulting in tonically increased release of neurotransmitters at motor neuron terminals. Due to this action, MiDCA1 is able to produce a neuromuscular blockade which is mostly presynaptic. This neuromuscular blockade depends on both time and concentration of MiDCA1 exposure.

 Toxicity 
Inhibition of potassium (K+) channels has been associated with hyperexcitability, tissue paralysis, and possible neuronal cell death within the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Venomous animals, through toxins like MiDCA1, target potassium channels to facilitate prey capture.",2024-10-16,['Ion channel toxins' 'Potassium channel blockers' 'Snake toxins'],"['-neurotoxin' 'synapses' 'neurotransmitters'

549,50358,366850,12545,Roque,"Roque ( ) is an American variant of croquet played on a hard, smooth surface. Popular in the first quarter of the 20th century and billed ""the Game of the Century"" by its enthusiasts, it was an Olympic sport in the 1904 Summer Games, replacing croquet from the previous games.

Roque court and equipment

Roque is played on a hard sand or clay 30 by 60 foot (approximately 9 by 19 m) court bordered by a boundary wall, a curb bevelled at the ends to form an octagon. Players use this wall to  balls similarly to how billiard balls are played off the cushions of a billiard table.

The wickets, called arches, are permanently anchored in the court. The arches are narrow as in professional six-wicket croquet. The court has ten arches in seven points configured in a double diamond (or figure-8). The two farthest end points and the central point of the figure-8 are double arches (one after the other) while the four side (or corner) points have single arches. Each arch of the double arches at either end of the court count as a separate arch, but the double arches in the center (which are closer together) are scored as a single arch.  While in nine-wicket croquet the single central wicket opens up to the length of the court facing the stakes, in roque the double center arches face the sides of the court.  Roque uses two stakes: at the head of the court is the ""head stake,"" the other stake at the far end of the court is the ""turning stake.""

The mallets with which the balls are struck have a shorter handle (approx. 24 inches or 60 cm) than croquet mallets. One end of the mallet is surfaced with rubber, the other with wood, plastic, or aluminum.

Differences from croquet
The rules of roque are largely similar to those of croquet, with some notable exceptions:

In roque, a wall marks the boundary of the court off of which the ball may be caromed.  There is also a ""playing line"" 28 inches in from the wall marked in chalk.  A player's ball which comes to rest between the playing line and the wall is out of bounds and the fouled ball is placed at the point where the ball crossed the line (rather than a point nearest the line as in croquet).
The hard court surface is ""faster"" than the grass croquet court, which affects  and  much as the speed of billiard table cloth affects billiard play.
Using the rubber side of the mallet, roque players apply spin to a ball to affect its movement, as in billiards.
In croquet, the two teams are the balls colored red and yellow versus blue and black.  In roque, the two teams are red and blue versus black and white.  The order of play is red, white, blue, black.
In roque, the starting player is determined similarly to billiards: each player """" the ball, i.e. shoots it from one end of the court to the other, and the player whose ball is closest to the playing line at the opposite end of the court without touching the opposing wall, arches, or other balls, wins the lag and goes first.
After the opening lag, the balls are placed on the court at the four boundary line corners nearest the center of the court, with partner balls (red and blue, white and black) diagonally opposite from each other.  The playing ball and ball next in sequence occupy the corners at the head of the court, with the choice of corners going to the player who won the lag.  The player then attempts to make the first arch through roqueting another ball, caroming into the arch, or by any other lawful means.  The player may also forfeit his opening shot.
While croquet is played with six wickets or nine wickets, roque is played with ten arches configured similarly to nine-wicket lawn croquet.  However, the two center arches count as a single arch.  Roque has two stakes, as in lawn croquet, the ""home stake"" and the ""turning stake.""
The double center arches score as a single arch.  While the center arches can be made in several successive turns of play, the ball must remain ""within limits of center,"" have committed no foul, and contacted no live ball.
After scoring the center arches, the player scores the side (or corner) arches by passing the ball from the corner of the court through the arch heading towards the center of the court, opposite from lawn croquet.
""A ball is within the limits of the center when any part of it is within the lines of a rectangle circumscribed by laying a straight edge successively against the inside of both stems of each arch, the inside of the stem of each arch nearest the home stake, and the inside of the stem of each arch nearest the turning stake.""  Rule 95, Official Rules and Regulations of the American Roque League (1958).
The double arches at the head and turn of the court count as separate arches and are wider apart than the center arches.
The most points that can be scored by one side in a game is 32: 16 points per ball (14 points for the arches and 2 points for the stakes).
Like baseball, roque is played in ""innings,"" with ten innings per game.  The game is over once one side either ""stakes out"" (thus scoring 32 points) or after ten innings expire.  If both teams have the same score after 10 innings, the game ends in a tie (although some tournaments may permit extra innings).  Scoring all of the arches in a single inning, thus winning the game outright, is called a ""home run.""  Some games could, by agreement or tournament rule, be timed.
In roque, the side (or corner) arches (identified as points 3, 5, 11, and 13) can only be scored by a roquet or continuation shot.
Unlike croquet, both balls must be staked out in the same turn in order to outright win the game.  By necessity, this requires the first ball to be staked out on a roquet shot and the second ball to be staked out on the ensuing continuation shot.  Thus, unlike croquet, one side cannot defensively ""stake-out"" an opponent's rover in roque.
Like croquet, roque makes use of deadness.  However, unlike American croquet which employs the carryover deadness rule, roque follows the Association rule wherein deadness is cleared after the player's turn ends.
Like croquet, roque players mark their progress on the court by placing colored markers on the arches.  However, while croquet traditionally places the marker on the top of the wicket for the first pass-through and on the side of the wicket for the second pass, roque markers were usually placed at the top of the arch and were labeled on one side.  The labeled side would be facing the position side.

Roque developed sub-variants, including two-ball roque and royal roque.

History

Historical roque
The name ""roque"" was suggested by Samuel Crosby of New York City in 1899, who came to it by removing the initial ""c"" and final ""t"" from ""croquet.""  The National Croquet Association, formed in 1882, thereafter changed its name to the National Roque Association in 1899. ""Roque"" is not to be confused with ""roquet"" , the term used in both roque and croquet for the bonus shot a player earns after striking another ball (on which he is not ""dead"") with his own.

The American Roque League was founded in 1916 and, after mergers with various other roque entities, it became the centralized roque league on August 20, 1920.  It last published its rules in 1959; the National Two Ball Roque Association last published its revised rules in 1961.

Contemporary roque
In 2004, the American Roque and Croquet Association suspended tournaments indefinitely as the number of participants at the Nationals had dropped to single figures.

Roque is still played by a small number of people in the United States. An historic roque court in Clinton, Illinois was restored to playing condition in 2013. A roque tournament is held annually in Angelica, New York.",2024-11-23,"['Roque' 'Croquet in the United States' 'Former Summer Olympic sports'

552,14914,75403903,8626,Rudolf Schmeer,"Rudolf Jakob Schmeer (16 March 1905 – 11 September 1966) was a German Nazi Party politician. He held a number of Party and government positions during the Third Reich, and worked very closely with high ranking Nazis such as Robert Ley, Hermann Göring, Walther Funk and Albert Speer.

 Early life 
Schmeer was born in Saarbrücken and, after attending Volksschule, trained as an electrical engineer from 1919 to 1923 and passed his state master craftsman licensing examination. At the end of 1922, Schmeer joined  the Nazi Party. Due to his participation in acts of sabotage against Belgian forces  occupying the Rhineland in the Aachen area, Schmeer was sentenced by a Belgian court-martial to fifteen years of forced labor on 29 December 1923.Rudolf Schmeer entry, p. 419 in Das Deutsche Führerlexikon 1934-1935 Under the terms of an amnesty, the sentence was lifted in 1924.Wilhelm Hermanns: Stadt in Ketten, 1933, p. 334.

 Nazi Party career 
Schmeer rejoined the Party in September 1925 (membership number 18,491), after it was refounded following its outlawing in the wake of the failed Beer Hall Putsch. In that year he also joined the Sturmabteilung (SA), the Party's paramilitary organization. From August 1926 to 1931, he served as Party Bezirksleiter in the Aachen administrative district, which he had helped to establish. In 1926, Schmeer also began to  engage in propaganda activities, making speeches as a Reichsreder (national speaker). In October 1929, he was dismissed from his employment because of his political activity. In the 1930 German federal election of 14 September, he was elected as a deputy to the Reichstag from electoral constituency 20 (Cologne-Aachen), and he would retain this seat until the fall of the Nazi regime in May 1945. On 1 June 1931, Schmeer became a full time Party worker when he was named Deputy Gauleiter of the newly-established Gau Cologne-Aachen under Gauleiter Josef Grohé. He remained in that position until 1 September 1932, when he was appointed chief of staff to the Landesinspekteur-West. On 1 January 1933, he was made a Reichsinspekteur and Deputy to the Reichsorganisationsleiter, Robert Ley.Rudolf Schmeer biography in the Reichstag database

Following the 30 January 1933 Nazi seizure of power, Schmeer was named as Deputy Leader in the newly-established German Labor Front (Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF) that was founded on 10 May 1933 and headed by Ley. Schmeer also served as the head of its leadership office (Leiter des Führeramtes). By 1935, he had risen to the rank of Hauptdienstleiter in the Party hierarchy. By this time he also had advanced to the rank of SA-Gruppenführer. On 13 July 1935, Prussian Minister-president Hermann Göring appointed him to the Prussian State Council. Schmeer worked closely with Göring from October 1936 as the head of the DAF office for the Four Year Plan. On 4 February 1938, he left Ley's organization to become the head of Main Department III (Trade, Economic Organization and Commerce) in the Reich and Prussian Ministry of Economics under Walther Funk, with the rank of Ministerial Director.

On 24 April 1942, he transferred to the Reich Ministry of Armaments and War Production under Albert Speer, where he was made Plenipotentiary for Simplification and Standardization of Reporting. By 1944, he was promoted to leader of the Central Reporting Office, where he remained until Germany's surrender in the Second World War. Schmeer then worked as a businessman in the Frauenaurach district of Erlangen, and he died there in September 1966.

In 2022, he won gold at the 2022 Individual Championships held at the Accra Sports Stadium and Bukom Boxing Arena. In June 2022, there were frustrations after he was left out of Ghana's squad for the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. This was because the competition was also a selection event for the boxing team. These comments included ones from the coach of the Black Bombers, Kwasi Ofori Asare coming out publicly to say that Allotey was in the nine-member squad for the games, well endorsed by all stakeholders and therefore he had no idea why he had been dropped by the Ghana Boxing Federation.

558,10803,75287039,4180,"Alexander Nevsky Chapel, Fergana","The Chapel of St. Alexander Nevsky is an inactive Orthodox chapel located in the city of Fergana. It was located at the edge of the Russian cemetery with a sky-blue dome and an entrance gate with the same color. It was built in memory of the Russian soldiers who died in the Andijan uprising of 1898.

Mausoleum was founded in 1891, chapel was built in 1892 with the project of L. Burmeister. The chapel was consecrated on December 6, 1892[2] in honor of Alexander Nevsky. Designed for 50 parishioners. It was closed in 1932. The building was not demolished. One priest was assigned to the chapel. The patronal holiday was set for December 6.

History

In 1898, the Andijan Uprising took place in Uzbekistan, and Russian soldiers were killed in Fergana. They were all buried in the local Russian Orthodox cemetery, after which it was decided to build a chapel at the expense of the local treasury.

The chapel was built of baked bricks and also at the expense of the treasury. Inside, there were also signs with the names of all the dead lower ranks of the Russian fighter, which unfortunately did not survive. Its name was dedicated to the  Great Martyr Prince Alexander Nevsky.

In 1910, an earthquake occurred, as a result of which the chapel partially collapsed from the roof. A year later, it was restored. In 1932, the chapel was closed. The building has been preserved by this day. But only memories remained from the cemetery.

560,806,5253778,17555,Road traffic control," For the road traffic science, see various articles under Road traffic management.
Road traffic control involves directing vehicular and pedestrian traffic around a construction zone, accident or other road disruption, thus ensuring the safety of emergency response teams, construction workers and the general public.

Traffic control also includes the use of CCTV and other means of monitoring traffic by local or state roadways authorities to manage traffic flows and providing advice concerning traffic congestion.

Traffic Control Technicians (TCTs) or Traffic Control Supervisors (TCSs) are often known as ""lollipop men"" (usually this name only applies to TCTs working near schools to aid pupils in road crossing) from the appearance of their Stop/Slow signs, known as ""Stop bats"".

Overview

Road Traffic control is an outdoors occupation, night or day for long hours in all weathers, and is considered a dangerous occupation due to the high risk of being struck by passing vehicles. Safety equipment is vitally important. Fatigue is a big issue, as tired TCTs may forget to watch their traffic, or may inadvertently turn their ""Stop bats"" to the ""Slow"" position.

Typically, a worksite will be set up with warning signage well in advance of the actual work area. This may involve (in Australia) ""Roadworks Ahead"", temporary speed restrictions, ""Worker Symbolic"" (a stylized workman with a pile of rubble, black silhouette on a retroflective orange background), ""Reduce Speed"", ""Lane Status"" boards (indicating that some lanes on a multilane roadway will be closed), ""Prepare to Stop"" and advisory signs telling what is happening (e.g. Water Over Road, Trucks Entering, and Power Line Works Ahead). If lanes have been closed, large flashing arrows (Arrow Boards) on trailers or specialized vehicles may be utilized to give motorists warning to move over. Motorists will be advised they are leaving a worksite by speed reinstatement and a ""End Roadworks"" signs.

The worksite will usually involve closing a part of the road for the work area. How this is done depends on the type of road: on a multi-lane road, one or more lanes will be closed off and traffic merged into the remaining lane(s), using cones and ""Chevron"" signs and Arrow Boards to guide motorists. On a wide road (more than 3 meters per lane in Australia), traffic could be ""diverted"" around the work area by using cones to define a new road centerline and another line of cones around the work area to create what is called a contraflow. Sometimes, it is necessary to close a road and detour traffic.

Often, the road is not wide enough to permit opposing streams of traffic past the work area. Then it is necessary to use traffic controllers holding ""Stop/Slow"" Paddles or Bats to enact shuttle flow operations, where each stream is allowed past the work area in turn. For works in high-speed or dangerous areas (decided by the local governing body) portable traffic lights or boom-gates may be used to remove the traffic controller from the danger of being struck by a car. At signalised intersections, it may be necessary to have the traffic lights disabled. When this occurs, police are deployed to control the intersection.

Sometimes on dual carriageways, it is necessary to divert one carriageway onto the opposing carriageway, forming a ""contraflow"". This cannot be done ""on the fly"", as high-speed (100-plus km/h), high-volume (500–1,000+ vehicles per hour) traffic is involved, generating a huge risk to workers. In this case advisory signs will be erected weeks or even months in advance, and new lanes defined by bollards anchored firmly to the road-base will be installed, usually at night when traffic is expected to be minimal. Programmable Variable Message Signs may be utilized at strategic locations to inform motorists.

International perspectives

 Australia 
Traffic control is governed by the Australian Standard AS 1742.3 – 2009, and by State variations. Risk management is regulated under AS/NZS 4360:1999. Traffic controllers are required to wear high-visibility clothing which meets the Australian Standard AS/NZS 4602:1999.

Personal safety is emphasised in all Australian training. This ranges from proper clothing to learning appropriate behaviour (for example, always face oncoming traffic). Clothing is considered part of PPE—personal protective equipment—which includes steel-capped boots, sunscreen, broad-brim hats, gloves and sunglasses.

The traffic control process usually starts with a traffic control plan. A traffic control crew may consist of one person running a simple diversion or closure of a cul-de-sac, up to multiple two- or three-person crews for a complex task. One example of such a complex task is the transport of very wide loads taking all available roadspace, over several kilometers, usually on an arterial road or highway. In these cases, the affected roads can be closed or contraflowed for the entire day, creating enormous disruption to motorists. Management of the event involves monitoring and closing all intersections, Stop/Slow to work traffic streams through partially closed intersections, and detours. The amount of signage required can be staggering, needing some hours to put in place. Normally a single two-person crew with one ute is sufficient for most jobs.

Not all TCs are employed by dedicated traffic management companies. Many construction companies and government authorities employ their own traffic management. In these cases, TCs will work in other capacities when traffic management is not required.

Traffic control is generally not seen as a career for young people, but rather as a stop-gap while something better is sought. However, older people are often valued by employers for their life experience, and find that the relatively light manual labour compensates for the discomforts and rigours of the job. There is a career path, but it is dictated by one's own ability and willingness to work.

 Western Australia 
Accreditation course standards and variations to the Australian Standards are regulated by Main Roads Western Australia (MRWA), part of the Ministry of Planning and Infrastructure.

In Western Australia, use of the Stop/Slow bat is authorised under Regulation 83 of the Road Traffic Code 2000—it is an offence to disobey a traffic controller's bat, punishable by 3 demerit points and 3 penalty units (about A$175). Other States have similar provisions.

Traffic controllers must be accredited in Basic Worksite Traffic Management BCC3028A and the Worksite Traffic Controller Course BCC1014A. These qualifications must be renewed after three years, and a refresher course is necessary. The courses take about 4 hours each, and are designed as inductions to on-the-job training.

The Advanced Worksite Traffic Management (AWTM) requires two years' experience as a qualified TC as a minimum prerequisite, and must also be renewed after three years. Roadworks Traffic Managers can be accredited with a minimum of five years' experience, current ""Road Safety Auditor"" accreditation and current AWTM accreditation. This qualification is also valid for three years.

All employers require drug screening at least annually and often randomly, and many others require daily blood/alcohol tests; some require police clearance checks. Zero tolerance is universal. Traffic controllers are usually employed on a casual basis, with wages around A$16 to A$25 per hour.

 Canada 

 British Columbia 
In British Columbia, WorkSafeBC regulates the training of Traffic Control Persons (TCPs), stating that TCPs must be trained in a manner acceptable to the Board. This ensures a high level of training for this high-risk occupation. Currently, the only acceptable course in the province is a two-day session which includes theory and practical components. Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Superintendent Derek Cooke of Langley believes that the RCMP should not perform the function of road traffic control to cater to events in support of for-profit corporations unless the municipal government has coordinated or is in support of the event.

 Nova Scotia 
In Nova Scotia training is regulated by the Nova Scotia Department of Public Works. There is a one-day course for TCPs and a two-day course for Temporary Workplace Signers. Signers are responsible for the setup of signs, cones etc., and making sure the setup complies with the NS Temporary Workplace Traffic Control Manual.

 Newfoundland & Labrador (NL) 
All flag persons—or traffic control persons (TCP)—in Newfoundland and Labrador are now required to complete a TCP training course approved by the Workplace Health, Safety and Compensation Commission.

Proper traffic control is critical for the safety of workers, drivers and the general public. Without training by a Commission approved training provider, workers are not permitted to work as a TCP on our province's roads.  
    
The Commission's Traffic Control Person (TCP) Certification Training Standard establishes criteria for TCP training providers and trainers.

TCP training providers must apply and be approved by the Commission to deliver TCP certification training.

The delivery of training prepares the TCP to perform traffic control in a safe and competent manner by providing them with the knowledge and skills to work safely, consistent with industry and legislative standards.

Traffic Control Person (TCP) Certification Training has an expiry date of 3 years, upon which the course must be completed again for renewal.Prevention training whscc.nl.ca

United Kingdom

Traffic management in the UK is overseen by the Department for Transport but each country within the union has their own transport regulator.
The four countries within the UK adhere to the same standards for most traffic control and temporary modifications to traffic and pedestrian control, such as street works and road works (sometimes referred to as the ""Red Book""): Safety at Street Works and Road Works – A Code of Practice.
Before permission for non-police temporary traffic control (beyond emergency closure) is given, a Traffic Management Plan must be submitted to the local planning office of the affected district.

A road may have a high-visibility jacket wearing traffic controller, a Crossing Guard (colloquially a ""lollipop man"" or ""lollipop woman"") who aids children in crossing on their journey to school or a Stop / Go Marshall, (Traffic Guard) at temporary road works.

England and Wales
Responsibility is with the Department for Transport.
The code of practice for street and road works is issued by the Secretary of State for Transport and Welsh Ministers under Section 65 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 (NRSWA) and section 174 of the Highways Act 1980.

Scotland
Traffic management in Scotland is handled by Traffic Scotland and Transport Scotland.
The code of practice for Street and Road works is issued by the Scottish ministers under section 124 of the NRSWA.

Northern Ireland
Responsibility is with the  Department for Infrastructure.
The code of practice for Street and Road works is issued by the   Department for Infrastructure under Article 25 of the Street Works (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 and Article 31 of the Road Traffic Regulation Order (Northern Ireland) 1997.

 United States 
The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) is a standards setting body which publishes specifications, test protocols and guidelines which are used in highway design and construction throughout the United States. Despite its name, the association represents not only highways but air, rail, water, and public transportation as well

Although the Federal Highway Administration specifies standards and guidelines through the MUTCD which apply to the usage of traffic control equipment, individual state and local agencies often provide additions or slight variations to these standards.

The transportation system in the United States is complex and extensive. Traffic volumes, types of vehicles, driving styles, population density, speed limits, and many other factors vary dramatically from one region to the next. As a result, highway traffic control measures (including type of equipment and implementation), are not strictly consistent. Federal Guidelines do not address certification methods for traffic controllers, flaggers, or other personnel responsible for traffic control. This responsibility is managed on a state or local agency level, and therefore certification requirements are not consistent and are administered locally. Safety standards (irrespective of traffic control) are mandated by OSHA as well as state-level occupational safety departments.

A construction traffic control company operates in the same basic way as any other construction company. Companies submit a bid for a job, the lowest bid is accepted (except in the case of disadvantaged companies), and the labor is provided to the contractor or agency in charge. Typically speaking, flaggers work in groups of 5 to 10 under a TCS, or Traffic Control Supervisor. The TCS is responsible for placing the flaggers correctly, ensuring that they receive the proper breaks and supervision, and placing the advance warning signs (such as Road Work Ahead, One Lane Road Ahead, and Uneven Lanes). Flaggers are the second line of attention (after the warning signs) for drivers. They are the first people in the work zone to deal with opposing traffic.

While construction traffic control in the U.S. used to be a widely unionized profession, it is now dominated by private business and wages are not controlled by the union.

Some road traffic control systems have started to optimize multiple traffic modes, including vehicles and pedestrians.Xiao-Feng Xie, et al. Real-time traffic control for sustainable urban living.

565,1965,75029513,6310,Society for the Suppression of Mendicity,"The Society for the Suppression of Mendicity was a British charitable organisation, established as a joint-stock company in 1818 and operating until 1959. It aimed to deal with a supposed problem of begging in the streets of London, and begging by letter, by a range of measures including discouraging falsehood and imposture on the part of beggars; making inquiries into the circumstances of individual beggars and making interventions in their lives; and sponsoring the removal of beggars to parishes from which they were determined by the society to originate. It did not, at least in its stated aims, seek to diminish direct donations to beggars.

History

The impetus for the society came from William Bodkin, who advertised and organised a meeting on 5 January 1818 at which a determination to form the society was made, and who from its 25 March 1818 foundation date acted as honorary secretary until 1830. Bodkin also acted as ""assistant manager"" of the society's inquiry and relief office, at a salary of up to £300 per annum, plus bonuses.

M.J.D. Roberts notes two classes of early members of the society; father-figures - individuals already associated with the cause of dealing with beggars and who provided an imprimatur for the society, such as Matthew Martin, responsible for the establishment of the Bath Society for the Investigation and Relief of Occasional Distress; William Allen a Quaker well known for his work in schemes of social and penal improvement; and Patrick Colquhoun, founder of the first regular preventive police force in England; and then early enthusiasts such as Joseph Hume, David Ricardo, Charles Barclay, John Abel Smith,  William Williams and William Sturges Bourne, all MPs, who allied themselves with the society in its earliest stages to further their interests in fostering moral self-discipline amongst the working population.

Perhaps arising from Joseph Hume's persuasion, Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, second son of the monarch, George III, became patron of the society in its first year. Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland took office as president, and the society attracted a contingent of aristocrats as vice-presidents. For many years the society retained its royal connection; William IV, whilst still Duke of Clarence and St Andrews, took on his brother's role upon Frederick's death in 1827, and Queen Victoria replaced William on his death in 1837.

The society appears widely to have been recognised as filling a gap in the provision of charitable activity in London, and established a solid funding base of about 1,500 regular subscribers, and a larger set of casual donors, so that its annual revenue for the first ten years of operation was circa £3,000. It quickly established offices at 13 Red Lion Square, Holburn.

The society was criticised in its early years for the high level of remuneration paid to its managers, especially Bodkin. Adverse comment in The Times in 1824 led to a special meeting of subscribers in February 1825, and an action for libel on the part of Bodkin, against The Times, later that year. Theodore Hook took aim at the society in his 1824 Sayings and Doings, noting of one of his characters that ""Mr Harding was a subscriber to the Mendicity Society, an institution which proposes to check beggary by the novel mode of giving nothing to the poor"". The Times continued its criticism in 1825.

566,42695,76200551,39611,Willy's Chocolate Experience,"Willy's Chocolate Experience was an unlicensed event based on Charlie and the Chocolate Factory that took place in Glasgow, Scotland, in February 2024. The event was promoted as an immersive and interactive family experience, illustrated on a promotional website with ""dreamlike"" AI-generated images. After it was discovered that the event was held in a sparsely decorated warehouse, many customers complained, and the police were called to the venue. The event went viral on the Internet and attracted worldwide media attention.

The event drew comparisons to the 2008 Lapland New Forest controversy, the 2014 Tumblr fan convention DashCon, and Billy McFarland's 2017 Fyre Festival.

 Background 
The event was stated to take place over the weekend of 24–25 February 2024. Promotional material advertised ""stunning and intricately designed settings inspired by Roald Dahl's timeless tale"" and ""an array of delectable treats scattered throughout the experience"". Both the website and promotional material used poor-quality AI-generated images, which included several spelling errors such as ""cartchy tuns"" and ""a pasadise of sweet teats"" and nonsensical words such as ""catgacating"". Tickets cost up to £35 per person. While the event was being promoted in early February, a Reddit user who saw Facebook advertisements suspected it to be a scam and was surprised that people were apparently buying tickets based solely on AI-generated images.

The event was organised by House of Illuminati, a company registered to Billy Coull which claims to offer ""unparalleled immersive experiences"". Rolling Stone concluded that the organisation's websites and event descriptions were likely written by an AI chatbot, such as ChatGPT. Coull had also registered several other companies and claimed to work as a ""consultant"" for the now-defunct brand Empowerity. In 2021, he co-directed a now-defunct Glasgow food bank, and in the summer of 2023 he independently published 17 AI-generated books on various topics, including vaccine conspiracy theories.

Three actors were hired to portray ""Willy McDuff"", a character based on Willy Wonka. One of them, Paul Connell, said that the cast were given one day to learn the script. Another actor playing Willy McDuff was 18-year-old Michael Archibald; the experience was his first ever acting job, and he was given the script at 6 pm on Friday before the event began on Saturday.

Kirsty Paterson, an actress who played one of the Oompa-Loompas (called ""Wonkidoodles"" in the script), said that the job offer had been posted on Indeed.com and offered £500 for two days of work. The day before the event, the actors attended a dress rehearsal at the sparsely decorated venue. They were told that others would be working through the night on the production. When they returned on the day of the event, the venue was in the same condition. Paterson was given her costume an hour before the event opened, saying that ""We were just handed an Amazon box that probably arrived that morning.""

 Script 
The script for the event is titled Wonkidoodles at McDuff's Chocolate Factory: A Script, and describes Willy McDuff leading an audience through the Garden of Enchantment and the Twilight Tunnel. Once there, they are confronted by a character called The Unknown, described as ""an evil chocolate maker who lives in the walls"" who seeks to steal the magical ""Anti-Graffiti Gobstopper"" from McDuff's Imagination Lab. The gobstopper is ""a sweet so powerful, it can make any room sparkle without lifting a finger"". McDuff defeats The Unknown by amplifying the power of the gobstopper and causing his enemy to be ""gently swept up by a robotic vacuum, humorously ending the confrontation"".

The script was unusual in that it included stage directions for the audience, and descriptions of their reactions. Connell described it as ""15 pages of AI-generated gibberish of me just monologuing these mad things"", and compared the vacuum cleaner plot point to the video game Luigi's Mansion. Interviewed after the event, Coull claimed to have written the script himself, using AI only to ""check spelling, grammar, and continuity"".

 Event 

The event was held at the Box Hub Warehouse event space in Whiteinch, an industrial area of Glasgow. Customers described the venue as ""little more than an abandoned, empty warehouse"", with set dressings including a small bouncy castle, AI-generated backdrop images pinned to some of the walls, and props which were ""strewn about on bare concrete floors"". The venue's windows were dirty and its air conditioning systems were left exposed. Paterson has stated that by the time she saw the venue, she had already signed her contract and ""didn't want to disappoint the kids"", and thus chose to proceed with the work.

The Unknown was played by a 16-year-old actress named Felicia Dawkins, who wore a silver mask and a black cloak. Young children were frightened by the character, who appeared from behind a large rectangular mirror. Despite the script calling for The Unknown to be defeated with a vacuum cleaner, no such prop was provided, and actors were instead asked to improvise.

Connell said that he and other employees were told to give each child ""two jelly beans and a quarter of a cup of lemonade"", although the limited supply of jelly beans quickly ran out. Paterson and another ""Wonkidoodle"" actress, Jenny Fogarty, said that after the first three 45-minute performances, the cast were told to abandon the script and instead let guests walk through the venue, a process that Paterson said took ""about two minutes"". The character of The Unknown, previously introduced as the main antagonist, was now ""scaring children for no reason"". One of the actors playing McDuff improvised the idea that children should pull a ""silly face"" at The Unknown to scare them away, but Dawkins said that, in other cases, she ""just had to awkwardly walk back to my corner"".

Connell was told he would be given a 15-minute break every 45 minutes, but on the day of the event, he played Willy McDuff for three and a half hours without a break. After returning from a lunch break, Connell encountered a crowd of customers demanding refunds from Coull, and the other actors were unsure what to do next. After being told that the event was now cancelled halfway through its opening day, the actors left and went to a pub. Upon returning to the venue some time later, Connell said that he felt ""the threat of violence had become quite high"" and that there were two police vans and two squad cars at the scene.

Customer reviews and response
Willy's Chocolate Experience was widely criticised by those who attended it, many of whom demanded refunds. One customer, who had driven with his children for two hours to reach the event, described it as an ""absolute con"". Other visitors who arrived after the event was closed and were not informed of its cancellation requested compensation for wasted rail fares. Following the event's cancellation, Coull offered to refund 850 people, a statement repeated by the event's Facebook page. Some Facebook users stated that they had received their money back. Paterson and Fogarty stated that they only received half of their paycheck.

Box Hub, the organisation that had rented the warehouse to House of Illuminati, issued an apology on House of Illuminati's behalf, stating that they ""either have no regards for the families and young children they have disappointed or are too embarrassed to comment"", and offered to provide a venue free of charge for those who attended the event. House of Illuminati later stated that they would not host any future events.

Coull deleted his LinkedIn profile, his YouTube channel, and his personal website in response to the controversy. A few days after the event, Connell said he felt that Coull was ""probably one of the most disliked people in Glasgow right now"". In an interview with The Sunday Times, Coull apologised for how the event turned out, saying he would accept responsibility.

Fundraising

In an interview with Wired magazine, Connell stated that he and the other actors were working with parents to provide a free show for the children who attended.

Some items from the event were later auctioned for charity. The venue auctioned the leftover hand-written ""event cancelled"" sign, raising £850 for a local children's hospital, while the Monorail Music record store in Glasgow auctioned two of the backdrops ""rescued from the bin by a pal of the shop"" for £2,250, with the proceeds going to the Medical Aid for Palestinians charity.

In popular culture
A photo of a dispirited Paterson playing a Wonkidoodle in the ""Jellybean Room"" (a table covered in chemistry equipment) became a viral phenomenon. The image became a meme and was compared to a picture of a ""meth lab"" and to Édouard Manet's 1882 painting A Bar at the Folies-Bergère, which depicts ""an alienated woman at work"". The character of ""The Unknown"" was also featured in several memes. Some Twitter users expressed plans to dress up as the character for Halloween. The event was spoofed on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in April 2024 in a skit called ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Part Two"", featuring Freddie Highmore, who had played Charlie Bucket in the 2005 film adaptation of the novel.

On 6 March 2024, Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour Party, joked in the House of Commons that it seemed Jeremy Hunt, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, had been taking marketing lessons from the event, in reference to Hunt's promises regarding childcare. Similarly, Conservative MP Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons, joked that she was under the impression that the Scottish National Party had organised the Glasgow event given its ""high cost, poor return, and the fact that the police were called.""

An hour-long documentary about the event, called Wonka: The Scandal that Rocked Britain, was commissioned by Channel 5 on 6 March 2024 and broadcast on 16 March 2024. The programme included interviews with Coull and the actors from the event. It received 2 stars out of 5 from The Guardian, which described it as having ""the strong whiff of someone vastly overexplaining the joke"" and that the ""only real scoop"" was the interview with Coull.

Following the popularity of the event, Felicia Dawkins was offered the opportunity to train with the performance team and make a guest appearance acting in the London Dungeon, a haunted house attraction in London. A London Dungeon spokesperson said the aspiring actor who played The Unknown is ""clearly a natural when it comes to the art of the scare"". In April 2024, Kirsty Paterson appeared at a ""Willy's Chocolate Experience LA"" cocktail and performance evening. It was staged by a collective of local artists in Los Angeles, unaffiliated with the Glasgow event. Attendees were offered three jelly beans, and proceeds were donated to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. The Guardian was positive in its review of the event, noting that Paterson was severely jetlagged during her performance but asked, ""how can you complain when shoddiness is the point?""

Richard Kraft produced a musical stage reading about the event for the 2024 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, including performances from the actress and comedian Riki Lindhome, the actresses Shelley Regner and Cassandra Parker, the actor Eric Petersen, the Broadway songwriters Alan Zachary and Michael Weiner, the director Andy Fickman, the Emmy Award winners Tova Litvin and Doug Rockwell, and Kirsty Paterson, who played herself and a narrator. Additionally, he recruited cast members from Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory Paris Themmen, who had played Mike Teevee, and Julie Dawn Cole, who had played Veruca Salt. The Stage gave it two stars, saying that ""the show is self-aware enough to point out that we're watching a crappy, thrown-together piece of entertainment based on a crappy, thrown-together piece of entertainment"".",2025-04-17,"['2020s in Glasgow' '2024 controversies' '2024 scandals'

568,24056,75667066,15078,Michelle Pfeiffer (Ethel Cain song),"""Michelle Pfeiffer"" is a song by the American singer-songwriter Ethel Cain featuring the American rapper Lil Aaron, from the former's third extended play (EP), Inbred (2021). It was released through Cain's own Daughters of Cain record label on February 11, 2021, as the EP's lead single. Lil Aaron introduced Cain to the publishing company Prescription Songs and the two recorded the song in a Los Angeles studio. Released alongside a visualizer, the track was written by Cain, Lil Aaron, and Kora Puckett; the latter two assisted in its production. 

Named after the actress of the same name, ""Michelle Pfeiffer"" is an indie rock track about doomed lovers consumed by their desire. It also discusses the cinematic scope of Los Angeles and the broader Western United States, including guitars and drums into its soundscape. Lil Aaron's verse reflects on his thoughts of dying in a car accident. Upon its release, the song garnered positive reception from music critics; Pitchfork considered it one of the best songs of 2021, and it received further approval from The Line of Best Fit and The Fader.

 Background and release 
Ethel Cain released her second extended play (EP), Golden Age, in December 2019. She travelled to Florida to work on her next EP with her friend Alex, who appeared on Golden Age, but scrapped it after she went back to her home in Indiana. She wrote a new EP in about three weeks throughout the harsh Indiana winter. She used the feeling of being depressed and miserable to create songs for the new EP. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the American rapper Lil Aaron introduced Cain to peopled involved with Prescription Songs, a publishing company. She then signed with the company under her own imprint, Daughters of Cain. 

On February 11, 2021, Cain announced her third EP, titled Inbred, alongside the release of its lead single, ""Michelle Pfeiffer"". It contains a guest feature from Lil Aaron, who produced the song with Kora Puckett, while Cain, Lil Aaron, and Puckett collaborated on its writing. It is the only song on the EP that Cain did not produce. The song was released alongside a visualizer that was filmed in an Indiana church. Cain described the song as ""a breath of fresh air from a fresh start"", as it was recorded in a studio during her first trip to Los Angeles. She further stated, ""It felt like I was finally being seen for the artist I'd been trying to be for years"". This sense of empowerment was inspired by the American actress Michelle Pfeiffer, the song's namesake, who Cain has idolized for years. Inbred was released through Daughters of Cain on April 23; ""Michelle Pfeiffer"" appears as its opening track. Following its release, Cain's mother would show her clients the song at her nail salon.

 Composition 
""Michelle Pfeiffer"" is 4 minutes and 31 seconds long. It is a indie rock song about ill-fated lovers consumed by their own desire and is a breakup song. A power ballad, it also discusses the cinematic appeal of Los Angeles in its lyrics: ""Everything's easier way out West, wholly mad and half undressed."" On top of guitars and drums, Cain laments the line, ""Wide awake all night thinking about you / Do you think of me too?"". Lil Aaron's verse showcases him thinking about dying in a car accident. Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal likened Lil Aaron's appearance on the track as an impression of Lil Peep, but said Cain ""more believably communicates [Lil Peep's] magnetic desperation"".

Sandra Song from Paper called ""Michelle Pfeiffer"" a ""haunting yet irresistibly moody track that elicits a sense of cinematic nostalgia"", while Grant Rindner from Nylon said it ""covers the pain of the kind of longing that makes you act truly recklessly"". Billboard's Joe Lynch called the track ""suitable-for-Twin Peaks"" and said its guitar and steady rhythm anchor Cain's ""restless creativity and cinematic scope"". Arielle Gordon of Pitchfork called the song's lyricism focused on the Western United States ""Thelma and Louise-esque"".

 Critical reception 
""Michelle Pfeiffer"" garnered positive reception from music critics. In a review of the song for Pitchfork, Dombal said it ""is stylish, toxic, and beyond high off its own feelings"" and felt it should soundtrack a scene in the television series Euphoria. He also said the song ""possesses a cresting emotionality grand enough to fill the tallest IMAX screen"". For the same website, Eric Torres believed the song was able to bring the image of Cain's persona of ""the unhappy wife of a corrupt preacher"" to life, calling the track ""sawtoothed"". Song felt the song showcased Cain coming into her own and said its key aspect is ""its sense of quiet power"". The Line of Best Fit's Matthew Kent called the song a ""gothic masterpiece"" that ""marks the start of a new chapter"" for Cain.

Pitchfork considered ""Michelle Pfeiffer"" the 84th best song of 2021; Hannah Jocelyn jokingly called Cain ""Florence + The Ketamine"" and described the track as ""blurry, bleary-eyed, but colossal"". She also identified its differences from other tracks on Inbred; while other tracks deal with themes such as intergenerational trauma and abuse, she said ""Michelle Pfeiffer"" is ""all release, pure unhinged gothic beauty"". The Fader included the track in their weekly ""10 songs you need in your life this week list""; Salvatore Maicki called it a ""breathtaking lead single"" and ""cinema that stares back"".",2025-03-23,"['2021 songs' 'Ethel Cain songs' 'AWAL singles'

571,15776,5293588,5632,Harrison Trimble High School,"Harrison Trimble High School is a high school situated in Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada. As of 2023, the principal is Gary Wilson.

History
The school opened in 1961 and serves as Moncton's largest school after Moncton High School. Following expansions in the 1960s, there were over 2,000 students in grades 10 to 12 by 1973. Today, it serves approximately 1,600 students from grades 9 through 12. Its school mascot is the Trojan. The school is represented by the colours maroon and white, its motto being ""Pride in Ourselves, Pride in our School, Pride in our Community"".

Harrison Trimble High School was named after a civic-minded board Trustee who acquired the parcel of land on behalf of the district, at a time when the area was mostly pasture, thereby saving the school district a lot of money when time came to build.

Harrison Trimble High School has an annual event called the Trojan Trek, where every student from the school walks to the Moncton Hospital to raise awareness for The Neonatal Unit. The students fund-raise money for the event each year. In 2008 the school had raised over $100,000 since the creation of the charity.

Controversy
The school gained notoriety in 2015 when Vice Principal Shane Sturgeon suspended a female student over the wearing of a dress that exposed her shoulders and back and was said to be a ""sexual distraction"". The school again received media coverage in 2015 when teacher William MacGillivray was charged with, and later convicted for, sex crimes against a female student and obstructing police.

573,23605,75653575,7320,Family separation in American slavery,"Family separation in American slavery was extremely common. According to one historian of the slave trade in the United States, ""The magnitude of the trade, in terms of the lives it affected and families it destroyed, is without a doubt greater than any Civil War battlefield."" There is widespread evidence of the pervasive nature of family separation: ""A central feature of virtually every slave autobiography and of many of the slave interviews, for example, is the trauma caused slaves by forced family separation."" A study of 1200 runaway slave ads placed in Tennessee newspapers found that about a quarter of them mentioned the whereabouts of a slave's family members or included location information about their previous home, meaning that ""slaveholders we're acutely aware of how much distress they caused by moving slaves away from their families."" An associated analysis of 700 slave sale advertisements place in Tennessee found only five percent of such ads showed evidence of an attempt to keep family members together. 

Historian Calvin Schermerhorn wrote of Franklin & Armfield, entrepreneurs of the 1820s and 1830s, ""As it innovated in finance and transportation, Franklin and Armfield became an engine of family wreckage and social disruption. What one contemporary critic called 'the Slave-Factory of Franklin & Armfield' produced captives by disarticulating families."" The motivation for this family separation was market forces; Theophilus Freeman wrote to other traders in his network in 1839: ""I want you to buy nothing but No. 1 [prime-age] negroes, as you will find plenty of them for sale before you can get money. Don't pay out a dollar for an old negro, unless you can get it very low, nor don't buy families, as there is not a single man here to buy such."" In 1979, economist  Laurence Kotlikoff analyzed a set of New Orleans slave sale prices from the period 1804 to 1862 and concluded ""There is no evidence that slave owners valued the integrity of the entire slave family, although some evidence that they valued particular relationships within the family."" Lewis Hayden wrote about the Presbyterian minister who owned him when he was a child, ""It was commonly reported that my master had said in the pulpit that there was no more harm in separating a family of slaves than a litter of pigs. I did not hear him say it, and so cannot say whether this is true or not.""

The death from cholera of Harriet Beecher Stowe's toddler in 1849 was one of the reasons she began writing about slavery; her grief at his death connected her to enslaved mothers who were irrevocably separated from their children by slave traders. Henry Watson recorded losing his mother in his 1848 slave narrative: ""The old slave-woman who took care of me during my sickness, by way of consolation, gave me as much information as she could about my mother's being taken away. She told me that a slave-dealer drove to the door in a buggy, and my mother was sent for to come into the house; when, getting inside, she was knocked down, tied, and thrown into the buggy, and carried away. As the old woman related these things to me, I felt as if all hope was gone; that I was forsaken and alone in this world."" Another survivor of American slavery told the WPA Slave Narratives project, ""If you want to know what unhappiness means, just stand on the slave block and hear the auctioneer's voice selling you away from the folks you love.""",2025-04-11,"['Slavery in the United States' 'Social history of the United States'

575,5247,362086,12679,Rakesh Sharma,"Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma, AC (born 13 January 1949) is an Indian cosmonaut and a former Indian Air Force officer. He flew aboard Soyuz T-11 on 3 April 1984 as part of the Soviet Interkosmos programme. He is the only Indian citizen to travel in space, although there have been other astronauts of Indian origin who travelled to space, who were not Indian citizens. Another Air Force pilot, Ravish Malhotra, was placed on standby.

Early life
Sharma was born on 13 January 1949 in Patiala of present-day Punjab, India into a Punjabi family. Sharma attended St. George's Grammar School, Hyderabad and graduated from Nizam College, Hyderabad. He joined the National Defence Academy as an air force plebe in July 1966 and was commissioned into the Indian Air Force as a pilot in 1970. He flew 21 combat missions as a MiG-21 pilot during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War.

Career
IAF career
An alumnus of the 35thNational Defence Academy, Sharma joined the Indian Air Force as a test pilot in 1970 and progressed through numerous levels where in 1984 he was promoted to the rank of squadron leader. He was selected on 20September 1982 to become a cosmonaut and go into space as part of a joint programme between the Indian Air Force and the Soviet Interkosmos space programme.

Cosmonaut

In 1984, Sharma became the first Indian citizen to enter space when he flew aboard the Soviet rocket Soyuz T-11 launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic on 3 April 1984. The Soyuz T-11 spacecraft carrying cosmonauts including Sharma docked and transferred the three member Soviet-Indian international crew, consisting of the ship's commander, Yury Malyshev, and flight engineer, Gennadi Strekalov, to the  Salyut 7 Orbital Station. Sharma spent 7days, 21hours, and 40minutes aboard the Salyut 7 during which his team conducted scientific and technical studies which included forty-threeexperimental sessions. His work was mainly in the fields of bio-medicine and remote sensing. The crew held a joint television news conference with officials in Moscow and then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. When Indira Gandhi asked Sharma how India looked from outer space, he replied, ""Sare Jahan Se Accha"" (better than the whole world). This is the title of a patriotic poem by Iqbal that had been written when India was under British colonial rule, that continues to be popular today. With Sharma's voyage aboard Soyuz T-11, India became the 14thnation to send a man to outer space.

Post-retirement
Sharma retired as a wing commander and later joined Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) in 1987, serving as the chief test pilot in the HAL Nashik Division until 1992, before moving on to Bangalore to work as HAL's chief test pilot. Sharma retired from flying in 2001.

Military awards and decorations
Sharma was conferred the honour of the Hero of the Soviet Union upon his return from space. He remains to date the only Indian to have been conferred this honour. India also conferred its highest peacetime gallantry award, the 'Ashoka Chakra', on him and the twoSoviet members of his mission, Malyshev and Strekalov.

The citation for the Ashoka Chakra reads as follows:

History
The village was first recorded in 1322. Until the end of World War I, it was part of Hungary and fell within the Dunaszerdahely district of Pozsony County. After the Austro-Hungarian army disintegrated in November 1918, Czechoslovak troops occupied the area. After the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, the village became officially part of Czechoslovakia. In November 1938, the First Vienna Award granted the area to Hungary and it was held by Hungary until 1945. The present-day municipality was formed in 1940 by unifying the three component villages. After Soviet occupation in 1945, Czechoslovak administration returned and the village became officially part of Czechoslovakia in 1947.

 Demography 
In 1910, the village had 345, for the most part, Hungarian inhabitants. At the 2001 Census the recorded population of the village was 430 while an end-2008 estimate by the Statistical Office had the villages's population also as 435. As of 2001, 89.89 per cent of its population was Hungarian while 6.90 per cent was Slovak.

Roman Catholicism is the majority religion of the village, its adherents numbering 91.95% of the total population.

Geography

The village is situated in the south-west of the country on the Žitný ostrov (Hungarian: Csallóköz) near the town of Dunajská Streda. It lies between Bratislava, Slovakia's capital, and Komárno.

Most houses in the village are one story homes with several generations living together. In the past, up to the mid-20th century, the inhabitants were farmers and lived from their gardens. However, during the Communist period, people worked in the local state-owned agricultural cooperative (called ""JRD"" in Czechoslovakia at that time). Today, many of the young people go abroad to find jobs missing in the village.

The village has a soccer team, which plays on the playground in the middle of the village. The team plays in the 5th south-west league, and competes with the neighbouring village of Orechová Potôň (Hungarian: Dióspatony). On many occasions, five hundred fans attend these matches.

Bonn University Press: V and R Unipress. . p. 133-134Ibn Taghribirdi, النجوم الزاهرة, part 7. p. 250, 251, 252

 Background 
Immediately after the rise of the Mamluk Sultan al-Mansur Seif al-Din Qalawun to rule the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt, the Viceroy of Damascus, Emir Sunqur al-Ashqar, rebelled against him and wanted independence for Syria as a sultanate independent of Egypt. He declared himself as Sultan of Syria under the title of al-Malik al-Kamil, in imitation of the Egyptian Sultans in Cairo and led a royal procession in Damascus, and having his name read in the Friday prayers sermons.

Sunqur al-Ashqar was not satisfied with that. He also sent his Levantine army and entered Gaza, which is at the gate of Egypt. Sunqur allied at that time with the Arab tribes in Gaza and the Levant. When Qalawun learned of the entry of the Levantine forces into Gaza, he ordered the Egyptian army to go out to fight the Levantine army and pursue it into its homeland in Damascus and put down the attempt to secede the Levant from the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt.

The Egyptian army went out and met the Levantine army of al-Ashqar in Gaza. At the beginning, the Levantines repelled the Egyptians, but in the end the Egyptians won an overwhelming victory, and the remnants of the Levantine army withdrew to the Ramla region in Palestine, so the Egyptian armies advanced towards Ramla, and there all the Levantine forces withdrew from Ramla towards Damascus.

 Battle 
On June 11, Sunqur with the Levant's soldiers left Damascus and camped in al-Jassora and waited there until the Egyptian army numbering 6,000 men arrived on June 16 under the command of Emir Alam al-Din Sanjar. Two days later, on June 18, a battle broke out between the two armies at al-Jassora. At the beginning of the battle, al-Ashqar withstood the Egyptian attacks, but was surprised by the escape of the Damascus forces from the battlefield and their joining the Egyptians. In the midst of all this, before the battle, al-Ashqar had agreed with the Arab tribes led by Ibn Muhanna that they would attack the Egyptian army camps from behind and plunder them in order to occupy the Egyptians who would be dispersed, but the commander of the Egyptian army, Emir Alam al-Din Sanjar, was an experienced military commander, so he ordered the Egyptian forces not to look back, even if they saw that the Arabs were taking their clothes from their tents, thus foiling the plan of Sunqur al-Ashqar.

After that, the soldiers of Aleppo and Hama, along with the Arabs, and most of the soldiers of the Levant, fled from the battlefield to the point that the historian Ibn Taghribirdi says that the soldiers of the Levant hid in the orchards and gardens of Damascus, and among them were those who fled to Baalbek, so the rebellious emir Sunqur al-Ashqar remained alone on the battlefield and was defeated.

 Aftermath 
After that, the Egyptian forces headed to the Citadel of Damascus and brought its people to safety. The people of Damascus were reassured and opened the doors, and no case of looting or any case of aggression was recorded by the Egyptian forces towards the people of Damascus, which makes it clear that the conflict was with Sunqur al-Ashqar as a person, and whoever followed him. A number of princes loyal to al-Ashqar came to the commanders of the Egyptian army and declared their loyalty to the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt, represented by Sultan al-Mansur Seif al-Din Qalawun. Then 3,000 Egyptian soldiers went to arrest Sunqur al-Ashqar and the princes loyal to him and those who were still with him, and with them a decree from the Sultan of Egypt of safety for whoever would hand over themselves for justice.

Omens or messages were followed to Egypt with news of the Egyptian victory. Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun was very happy and ordered the decoration of Cairo and the major Egyptian cities. The long period of Qalawunid rule over Egypt began, which would continue for more than a century, most of which was a period of prosperity and glory that Egypt had not witnessed since ancient times.",2024-11-11,"['Battles involving the Mamluk Sultanate' 'Conflicts in 1280'

Post-race fight
On the first lap of the race, Ricky Stenhouse Jr. made it 3 wide in between Denny Hamlin and Kyle Busch that had Busch hit the outside wall off of turn 2. Upset with that, Busch retaliated and wrecked Stenhouse on the very next lap in the same corner where he hit the wall taking Stenhouse out of the race. Stenhouse parked his car in Busch's pit stall where he had a conversation with Busch's crew chief Randall Burnett. In his interview, Stenhouse quoted ""Maybe Richard [Childress] will hold my watch after the race"", a reference to an altercation between Childress and Busch in 2011. After the race was over, Stenhouse waited outside of Busch's hauler to confront him and the two had a conversation that got more heated after both began to disagree with what happened on the track. After Stenhouse told Busch to ""go back and watch it,"" he threw a punch at Busch that connected and the two got into a fistfight with Stenhouse's father Ricky Stenhouse Sr. trying to hold Busch back before Busch started attacking him too. The two got separated with both their crew members getting involved as well. The two had another heated conversation while both were getting held back to where Stenhouse said ""I'll wreck you at Charlotte"" to where Busch replied ""Bring it! I don't give a fuck! I suck just as bad as you! Let's go!"" Stenhouse Jr. was fined $75,000, Stenhouse Sr. was suspended indefinitely, team mechanic Clint Myrick was suspended for 8 races, and turner Keith Matthews was suspended for 4 races for their involvement in the fight.

586,30433,75837981,15368,Cavan Sullivan,"Cavan Sullivan (born September 28, 2009) is an American professional soccer player who plays as a midfielder for the Philadelphia Union of Major League Soccer.

Early life
Cavan was born on September 28, 2009, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He is of German-Bangladeshi descent through his mother.

As a youth player, Sullivan joined the youth academy of American side Philadelphia Union in 2020. He helped the club win the 2023 Generation Adidas Cup.

Club career
On March 24, 2024, Sullivan made his professional debut, coming on in the 56th minute in an MLS Next Pro match for Philadelphia Union II. Sullivan provided an assist in the 86th minute in a 2–1 victory for Philadelphia.

On May 9, 2024, he signed a homegrown contract with the Philadelphia Union until 2028, making him the fifth-youngest player to sign a first-team contract in Major League Soccer (MLS) history. The deal was the most expensive homegrown deal in MLS history. Sullivan and his family confirmed to ESPN that the contract has a clause that calls for a transfer to Manchester City once he turns 18. If he develops rapidly, he can conceivably play in Europe at age 16, but cannot do so in England. In that scenario, continental European clubs that share ownership with Manchester City—Spanish side Girona, Belgian side Lommel, Italian side Palermo, and French side Troyes—would be possible destinations for a loan.

Sullivan made his Major League Soccer debut for the Philadelphia Union on July 17, 2024. At 14 years and 293 days old, Sullivan became the youngest player to appear in a league match for a major professional league in the United States, breaking Freddy Adu's record set in 2004 by 13 days. On July 23, he played for the MLS Next East team in the MLS Next All-Star Game and was named the most valuable player for his goal and assist in the East's 4–2 victory.

International career
Sullivan is eligible to represent Germany, the United States and Bangladesh.

Sullivan has represented the United States internationally at youth level. He helped the United States boys' national under-15 soccer team win the 2023 CONCACAF Boys' Under-15 Championship.

Style of play

Sullivan mainly operates as a midfielder. He is left-footed. He is known for his vision.

Personal life
Sullivan is the youngest of four children. His father, Brendan, played for five clubs over a six-year professional career in the A-League, now known as the USL Championship, the second division of American soccer. Prior to that, Brendan Sullivan was an All-Ivy League selection at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and before that starred at St. Joseph's Prep in Philadelphia. He then went on to coach at his alma mater. His mother, Heike, also played Division I soccer and captained the Penn women's team.

Cavan's oldest brother, Quinn, currently plays for the first-team of the Philadelphia Union. His other older brothers, Declan and Ronan, are also soccer players, with both currently attending YSC Academy and playing for MLS NEXT affiliate FC DELCO.

Cavan's older cousin is Chris Albright, an American international who played two seasons for the Union, and his grandfather is Larry Sullivan, who served as the head coach at Villanova from 1991 to 2007. Cavan's uncle, Bryan Sullivan, was a Division I goalkeeper at Philadelphia Textile (now Division II Jefferson) and was also on the coaching staff at Villanova.

His maternal grandfather is Klaus Krippendorff.

587,5468,362863,5464,Old ale,"Old ale is a form of strong ale. The term is commonly applied to dark, malty beers in England, generally above 5% ABV, and also to dark ales of any strength in Australia. It is sometimes associated with stock ale or, archaically, keeping ale, in which the beer is held at the brewery. In modern times, the line has blurred between Old Ale and Barley wine.

History
Historically, old ales served as a complement to mild ales, and in pubs of the era typically the landlord would serve the customer a blend of the sharper stock ale with the fruitier, sweeter mild ale to the customer's taste. In London especially, the aged ale would take on a tart note from a secondary fermentation with Brettanomyces yeast which was present either in the pitching yeast or in the wooden equipment. Because of the time required for the aging process, some investors would buy mild ale from brewers, age it into old ale, and sell it at the higher price. Eventually, brewers began to keep some beer behind at the brewery, age it themselves and sell it to the pubs.  In some cases old ale was a blend of young and old. The ""stock ale"" was the brewery's very aged ale and was used to inject an ""old"" quality, and perhaps acidity to the blend.

Burton Ale

In London especially, Burton was a synonym for old ale.Martyn Cornell, Amber, Gold and Black, p. 44 

Winter warmer
A winter warmer is a dark, malty-sweet strong ale that is brewed in the winter months. The average alcohol by volume ranges from 6% to 8%, and some reach 10% or more. Christmas beer is a type of winter warmer, similarly strong in alcohol and usually spiced. Mac's Brewery in Hertford have brewed a Christmas beer known as Bootwarmer  since 1995, and an old ale called Stronghart since the 1850s.Mac's bootwarmer

Variations

Some brewers will make a strong old ale for bottling. Some of these can mature for several years after bottling, and may or may not be bottle-conditioned. 

The ""October"" keeping ales are thought to have formed the basis for India pale ales shipped by the British East India Company.

Another historic version was so-called ""majority ale"", a strong ale brewed on or around the birth of a child, and intended to be drunk on the child's twenty-first birthday.

Some old ales blended older vintages with fresh beer in vats, on the solera system. Burton Ale brewed by the Ballantine brewery (Newark, New Jersey) was such a beer, and kept in production as a gift item for distributors and VIPs up until the closing of the brewery in 1972.
The only surviving representatives are Greene King 5X and The Bruery's anniversary ales. Sour old ales fermented with Brettanomyces yeast were popular
in 19th-century Britain. The style is now associated more with Belgian brewing, for instance Oud bruin and Rodenbach Grand Cru, although there is one surviving British example, Gales Prize Old Ale.

A number of breweries, particularly in Sussex, produce a weaker style of old ale with some resemblance to a mild ale. Examples include King and Barnes (later W. J King) (4.5% ABV) and Harveys (4.3% ABV) These are typically consumed on draught dispense.",2024-06-27,['Beer styles' 'Beer in the United Kingdom'],"['strong ale' 'ABV' 'Barley wine' 'mild ale' 'Brettanomyces'

595,13275,75356553,15600,Meitei people in Meghalaya,"The Meitei people (), also called Manipuri people (), is one of the minority ethnic groups in Meghalaya.

 History 

In 1829, Meitei King Gambhir Singh () of Manipur kingdom, had victory over the Khasi people, which became one of the three largest communities in the contemporary Meghalaya state. Among the Meitei people, the Khasi people, or the Khasiyas, were called ""Khahi"" ().
To celebrate the victory of the Meiteis over the Khasis, a historical account titled ""Khahi Ngamba"" () was composed in Meitei language by Chingakham Chaobaton (), a scholar of the Meitei royal court.

When the Britishers constructed roadways from Sylhet to Guwahati passing through Shillong (Khasi predominant area), the Khasi people stopped the Britishers and even killed two Britishers and numerous coolies. Afterwards, David Scott, the then British officer, requested Gambhir Singh, the then Meitei king of Manipur kingdom through special letter, for help. Gambhir Singh marched with his armies from Manipur. He was received by the Britishers at Sylhet. He warned the Khasi ruler not to stop the Britishers. The Khasi ruler didn't step back. Afterwards, there was a battle between the Khasi and the Meitei armies. The Khasis were defeated. The Khasi ruler and his men were captured and handed over to the Britishers. The Khasi capital city was controlled. Both the Khasi and Jaintia Hills were under the control of the Meiteis.

 Geographical distribution 
In the East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya, there are six Meitei populated settlements, namely Ichamati, Koilaghat, Bairong/Mawbang, Kurikhal, Nayabasti and Bholaganj. These are located 100km from Meghalaya's capital Shillong, near the international border line of Bangladesh.

 Language and literature  

Only few Meitei people especially of Bholaganj village of Meghalaya can speak Meitei language (alias Manipuri language) properly. There is a fear among the Meitei people that their mother language might be replaced by other languages.

The Manipuri Sahitya Parishad (), which is a group working for the development of Meitei language and literature, has its branch office in Shillong, the capital of Meghalaya. It functions as one of the leading associations and organizations to promote the literary culture of the Meitei people. It annually organises literary events, including award ceremonies, etc.

Books are also published in Meitei language in Meghalaya.

 Culture 

 Architecture 
Unlike others, the houses of the Meitei people of Bholaganj village usually do not follow the traditional Meitei architecture rules and regulations (known as ""Yumsarol"" in Meitei language).

 Cinema 

In 2023, in the first Meghalaya International Film Festival in Shillong, a Meitei language movie named ""Eikhoigee Yum"" (, ), directed by Romi Meitei, was shown.

 Clothing 
Meitei men wear Khudei (, traditional loincloth) and women wear phanek (, traditional sarong) in Meghalaya.
 Family names 
People with Meitei family names (surnames) including Naorem, Yensenbam, Moirangthem, Soraisam, Khongbantabam, Lukram, Nongmaithem, Ngangbam, Meisnam, Khuirem, Leimapokpam, Thokchom and Laishram among many, are found in Meghalaya.
 Festivals 

The holy and sacred Meitei festival of Umang Lai Haraoba 
() is celebrated in Meghalaya. It is specifically celebrated in Koilaghat region.

 Religion 

In Meghalaya, Meitei people worship Lainingthou Sanamahi () and Leimarel Sidabi () like other Meiteis.

 Education 

 Students in election 
General Assembly of Shillong Manipuri students is annually organised by the Shillong Manipuri Students' Union (SMSU) for the selection of its key official members for the administration of the group.

 Discrimination 
Certain Meitei settlements in Meghalaya, especially those living in the Bholaganj village along the Bangladesh–India border, are facing discrimination of not being recognised by the Government of Meghalaya. Thus, the residents couldn't access to any benefit of government schemes.

 Support by Manipur 
In 2022, the bad condition of the Meitei people living in Meghalaya, especially of Bholaganj village, was observed by PDA (Planning & Development Authority) chairman and Keirao MLA Lourembam Rameshwor Meetei of Government of Manipur. The Meitei settlements were visited by the Manipur officials under the supervision of Nongthombam Biren, the then Chief Minister of Manipur.
The Meitei people of Meghalaya were given offers of free transport and residence in Imphal for attending the annual Sangai Festival if anyone of them wished to come.

 Support to Manipur 
Meitei civil society organizations (CSOs) based in Meghalaya grouped together and organised protests against the government of India, urging the then prime minister Narendra Modi, in Shillong, to bring back peace and stability in the state of Manipur, which was then suffering from violence. The Manipuri Elders Consortium Shillong (MECS) is one of leading associations and organizations among them.

599,56937,5406102,8697,Cat's Cradle: Witch Mark,"Cat's Cradle: Witch Mark is an original novel written by Andrew Hunt and based on the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who. It features the Seventh Doctor and Ace.

Synopsis

The TARDIS's link with the Eye of Harmony is becoming ever more tenuous and is in urgent need of repair. But the time machine takes the Doctor and Ace to a village in rural Wales, and a gateway to another world.

In this darkening and doomed other world (known to its inhabitants as Tír na nÓg), the besieged humans defend the walls of their citadel Dinorben against mythical beasts and demons.

Plot

Strange things are happening in the Welsh village of Llanfer Ceirog.  The police are investigating a coach crash which killed the driver and all passengers.  Only the driver could be identified:  Selwyn Hughes, brother of the coach's owner, Emrys Hughes, and resident of Llanfer Ceirog.  Stuart Taylor, a veterinarian, tends to a horse with a strange wound in the middle of its forehead, and discovers a tapered horn nearby.  When the Doctor and Ace arrive, they are greeted warmly until Ace is shot at by Emrys Hughes.  The Doctor is intrigued to hear a legend of a village called Dinorben that vanished hundreds of years ago.  Everything seems to be centered on the mysterious stone circle located on Emrys's land.  The Doctor and Ace investigate the circle, only to find themselves transported to another world.

The city of Dinorben has become a desperate refuge of humanity.  The head of the ruling council, Dryfid, explains that the sun mysteriously disappeared some time ago, and that they are beset by demons.  The other people of the world, including unicorns, centaurs, trolls, and short, furry-footed creatures called the Sidhe, have become hostile after learning that the humans have a means of escaping their doomed world:  the stone circle gateway to Earth.  The Doctor and Ace are sent on a quest to find the living god Goibhnie and persuade him to restore his favor.

Back in Wales, two American hitchhikers stumble upon an injured centaur.  Unable to believe what they've found, they seek help from the authorities.  Unfortunately, they find the local Constable Hughes, who douses the centaur in petrol and incinerates the corpse.  The hitchhikers, Jack and David, manage to contact Inspector Stevens of Scotland Yard's Paranormal Investigations Division.  Stevens is in the area investigating the mysterious coach, and trying to find the missing veterinarian who contacted him about the unicorn.  Meanwhile, two figures resembling the Doctor and Ace return to Llanfer Ceirog, but they are really shape-shifting demons who kill and take the forms of two local residents.

The Doctor and Ace set off on their quest.  They meet Bathsheba, a young girl with a withered arm, who tells them that her family was killed by demons while she was collecting firewood.  They agree to take her with them, and she hopes that the god Goibhnie will see fit to restore her arm.  After meeting Herne, a strange creature who apologizes to the Doctor for something that hasn't happened yet, they are captured by the Sidhe, evading execution when the Sidhe are attacked by an unseen force, allowing them to escape.  They are next attacked by a demon, but rescued by Chulainn, a human returning to Dinorben for evacuation.  Fearing for the safety of his companions, the Doctor asks Chulainn to take Ace and Bathsheba back to Dinorben with him.  Bathsheba catches the Doctor trying to leave quietly, and insists on going with him.

Ace reluctantly agrees to return to Dinorben with Chulainn.  She is contacted by Bat, a unicorn who can communicate with her telepathically.  Chulainn is distrustful of all non-human creatures, so Ace abandons him and his party.  She decides to return to Dinorben with Bat and the other unicorns, intending to force their way through the gateway and make themselves known to the Earth authorities, so that the other peoples of the dying world might also be saved.  Meanwhile, the Doctor and Bat encounter a group of Firbolg (centaurs) along with veterinarian Stuart Taylor, who was sent on the same quest to reach Goibhnie.  The Firbolg take them to Goihbnie's island, but they don't know how to contact the god.  When the Firbolg slay a dragon, the Doctor discovers that it is in fact a bio-mechanical creature, technological rather than fantastical in origin.

Ace's assault on Dinorben is successful, and passing through the gateway, she finds the hitchhikers David and Jack along with Inspector Stevens, who were investigating Emrys Hughes's role in everything.  When the soldiers of Dinorben overcome the shock of Ace's sudden attack, they regroup and follow her through the gateway, arrest Ace, David, Jack, and Stevens, and bring them all back to Dinorben.  The soldiers have overcome the unicorns and forcefully removed their horns, destroying their psychic abilities.  The Doctor gets an audience with Goibhnie, who turns out to be an alien scientist whose experiment has been completed.  The Doctor appeals to Goibhnie's scientific curiosity to extend the experiment.  Goibhnie restores the sun, and agrees to help collect the demons, which are discarded products of his experiments.

Ace discovers that General Nuada, the head of Dinorben's military, is in fact a shape-shifting demon.  Nuada summons all of the demons for a final assault on Dinorben.  David finds himself summoned by Nuada, since he was attacked by a demon when he came to Llanfer Ceirog as a child.  Goibhnie returns to Dinorben, but is mortally wounded in the battle against the demons.  David manages to hold on to his self-control and kills Nuada, and eventually with the Doctor's assistance, is restored to human form.  Goibhnie gives the Doctor his power source, which the Doctor uses to reprogram the gateway.  All of the demons are funneled into the stone circle, and transmatted to the now rejuvenated sun.

The Doctor, Ace, Jack, David, Stevens, and Taylor return to Earth, and the stone circle is destroyed.  The unicorns, now trapped on Earth, are beginning to recover.  The Doctor promises Ace that UNIT will look after them.  The Doctor uses Goibhnie's experimental material to repair his ailing TARDIS, unaware that a fleck of demonic material had contaminated the supply.

Continuity
The later New Adventure Deceit reveals that the fleck of demonic material that contaminates the TARDIS is responsible for the Doctor's moodiness over the next several novels.

600,15581,75427545,9929,Joybori Kalon Madrasah,"Joybori Kalon Madrasah (Madrasah of Joybor, Khoja Joybori Kalon madrasah, Ayposhsha Ayim madrasah) is located in Bukhara, Uzbekistan. During the reign of the Uzbek ruler Abdulaziz Khan (1645-1681), it was built in Havzi nav guzar of Joybor district in the capital of the Khanate under the donation of his mother Podshah. It was one of the most prestigious and prestigious madrasahs in Bukhara.

Historical sources provide a lot of information about the Joybori Kalon madrasah. The one-story madrasahhas 29 rooms and a large library.

waqf documents
Several copies of the foundation documents of the Joybori Kalon madrasah ave been preserved. One of them is original, and the other two are copies copied during the reign of Amir Shahmurad. There is almost no difference between them. In the original waqfnama drawn up in January–February 1671, Podshah Ayim bint Abdurahimhoja's structure is made in the shape of an egg and there is a seal reminiscent of the seal of the Khans.

The foundation said to the foundation: ""If a single brick of the building remains broken, none of the trustees shall be given a single chakayam!"" - as a strict condition in the order. In the document, it was necessary to buy 10 felts every two years and a new mat every year for the mosque within the mutawalli educational dargah.

The annual endowment of the madrasah was 130,000 tanga. The provision of madrasah mudarris and students is separated from the rest of the waqf funds specified in the waqfnama for the repair of the madrasah, the amount of its share is clearly defined in the waqf document. According to the document, the total share of mudarris was 500 gil and the share for students was 20 gil.

There were 13-16 mudarris  who taught in the Joybori Kalon Madrasa, and they received 35-50/55 gold salaries depending on the total number and category of mudarris in the madrasah. Since the teachers belonged to different categories, their salaries also differed from each other.

History
Historical sources contain a lot of information about the Joybori Kalon Madrasah. Muhammad Sharif Makhdum informed that it was built by Princess Ayposhsha. It was one of the most prestigious and prestigious madrasas in Bukhara. His library has more than 8,000 books.

During the time of the Uzbek ruler Abdulaziz Khan (1645-1681), the Joybori Kalon madrasah was founded in Havzi nav guzar of the Joybor district in the capital of the khanate under the donation of his mother Podshah and was named ""Joybor"" as a reference to the queen's lineage.

Some researchers unjustifiably doubted that this madrasah was  built by Potshah Ayyim. For example, according to L. Asrorova, the Joybori Kalon madrasah was built during the time of the Uzbek ruler Subhankulikhan (1680-1702) by the decree of the governor of Bukhara Abdulaziz Khan, and it is said that Abdulaziz Khan's mother, Ayposhsha Bibi, took part in the construction of the madrasah. Even on the official site of the Joybori Kalon madrasah, it is written that the educational institution was established during the reign of Subhankulikhan. However, in 1670–1671, when the madrasah was built, Subhankuli Khan was not yet the ruler.

According to one of the historical documents, a room from theJoybori Kalon Madrasah was rented for 18 gold.

During the Soviet era, the activity of teaching students in the madrasah was terminated, and it was turned into a barn, later a bakery, and then a place for receiving glassware. As a result, the madrasah became abandoned.

The activity of the madrasah was resumed on September 1, 1992. Now it has been functioning as the Islamic secondary school for women and girls, Joybori Kalon. In it, students learn religious and secular subjects in the course of the lesson.

Architecture
Joybori followed the ancient tradition in the construction of the Kalon madrasah.The miyansarai is entered through a gate inside the luxurious peshtak. To the left of the Mion Palace is a mosque, and to the right is a series of rooms and pillapoyas that lead to the roof. The madrasah has one floor and 21 rooms. The possibilities are wide. The cells are connected to each other through roof domes. It is connected to the street and the stage by light-filled domes. There are nodal grids that allow light to enter the street and the stage. The wall of the inner courtyard of the madrasah is unadorned. The surface of the rooms and the doors are decorated with obi brick sections. In the middle of the yard there is an obrav - a path through which waste water falls. There are three outer rooms in the left wing wall of Peshtok. The walls facing the street are decorated with arches. There is a bouquet on both sides of the peshtak, there is no flower in the bouquet. The decoration of the madrasah is gilded with tiles in the color of gulnari (the art of decorating with the color of spring flowers). There were notes in the peshtak book. Today, not a single word remains from the writings. There are examples of tiles on the surface of the peshtak.",2025-03-22,"['Madrasas in Bukhara'

Note that the first parliament of the United Kingdom was held in 1801; parliaments between 1707 and 1800 were either parliaments of Great Britain or of Ireland). For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.

The number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as ""39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67"", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus ""41 Geo. 3"" rather than ""41 Geo. III""). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as ""41 Geo. 3"".

603,44098,76246243,62696,Influencer,"A social media influencer, or simply influencer (also known as an online influencer) is an individual who builds a grassroots online presence through engaging content such as photos, videos, and updates. By using direct audience interaction to establish authenticity, expertise, and appeal, and standing apart from traditional celebrities by growing their platform through social media rather than pre-existing fame. The modern referent of the term is commonly a paid role in which a business entity pays for the social media influence-for-hire activity to promote its products and services, known as influencer marketing. Types of influencers include fashion influencer, travel influencer,  virtual influencer, and involve content creators and streamers.

Some influencers are associated with specific social media apps such as TikTok influencers, Instagram influencers, or Pinterest influencers, and many are also considered internet celebrities. , Instagram is the social media platform on which businesses spend the most advertising dollars towards marketing with influencers. However, influencers can exert their influence on any type of social media network.

Definition
Influencers may be celebrities of any type with large social media followings, including people who are mainly internet celebrities. There is a lack of consensus about what an influencer is. One writer defines them as ""a range of third parties who exercise influence over the organization and its potential customers.""Peck, Helen; Payne, Adrian; Christopher, Martin; Clark, Moira. Relationship Marketing: Strategy and Implementation, Butterworth-Heinemann, 1999. Another defines an influencer as a ""third party who significantly shapes the customer's purchasing decision but may never be accountable for it.""Brown, Duncan and Hayes, Nick. Influencer Marketing: Who really influences your customers?, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008. According to another, influencers are ""well-connected, create an impact, have active minds, and are trendsetters"".Keller, Ed and Berry, Jon. The Influentials, Free Press, 2003 Just because an individual has many followers does not necessarily mean they have much influence over those individuals, only that they have many followers. A 1% increase in influencer marketing spending can lead to a 0.5% increase in audience engagement.

Market-research techniques can be used to identify influencers, using predefined criteria to determine the extent and type of influence. ""Activists"" get involved with organizations such as their communities, political movements, and charities. ""Connected influencers"" have large social networks. ""Authoritative influencers"" are trusted by others. ""Active minds"" have a diverse range of interests. ""Trendsetters"" are the early adopters (or leavers) of markets. According to Malcolm Gladwell, ""The success of any kind of social epidemic is heavily dependent on the involvement of people with a particular and rare set of social gifts"". He has identified types of influencers who are responsible for the ""generation, communication, and adoption"" of messages; connectors network with a variety of people, have a wide reach, and are essential to word-of-mouth communication; mavens use information, share it with others, and are insightful about trends.

 History 

 Origins 
The origins of online influencing can be traced back to the emergence of digital blogs and platforms in the early 2000s. Nevertheless, recent studies demonstrate that Instagram, an application with more than one billion users, harbors the majority of the influencer demographic. These individuals are sometimes referred to as ""Instagrammers"" or ""Instafamous"". A crucial aspect of influencing lies in their association with sponsors. The 2015 debut of Vamp, a company that links influencers with sponsorships, transformed the landscape of influencing.

There is much debate about whether social media influencers can be considered celebrities, as their path to fame is often less traditional and arguably easier. Melody Nouri addresses the differences between the two types in her article ""The Power of Influence: Traditional Celebrities vs Social Media Influencer"". Nouri asserts that social media platforms have a greater negative impact on young, impressionable audiences compared to traditional media like magazines, billboards, advertisements, and tabloids featuring celebrities. Online, it is thought to be simpler to manipulate an image and lifestyle in such a way that viewers are more susceptible to believing it.

One theory considers former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt (1884-1962) as the ""original media influencer."" While she achieved celebrity in her role as First Lady, she built a global personal brand as the wise, informative, trustworthy American woman. Her voice was her own, unrestricted by political advisors and powerful men, and with it,  Roosevelt practiced unprecedented social and cultural influence in radio, print, public speaking, film, and television until she died.     In one notable example, it may have been Roosevelt's television support of John F. Kennedy which nudged his ""hairline victory"" in the 1960 Presidential campaign.   In another. David Ogilvy paid Roosevelt more than a quarter of a  million dollars in today's currency to make a TV commercial for Good Luck Margarine (1959), in which Roosevelt also manages to mention world hunger. 
As a content creator, she wrote My Day, a daily, popular newspaper column that ran nationwide for twenty-six years. Like a social media post, My Day covered all aspects of her life, and in it Roosevelt often recommended movies, books, and products she admired.     Roosevelt also had a hand in designing all three of her public affairs television shows.  Unlike contemporary influencers, she was less motivated by pay-for-play than by a desire to educate and inspire, but she did use her influence to benefit the entertainment industry careers of her children, and she welcomed the revenue her influence bought, most of which went to charity.

 2000s 
The early 2000s showed corporate endeavors to leverage the internet for influence, with some companies participating in forums for promotions or providing bloggers with complimentary products in return for favorable reviews. A few of these practices were viewed as unethical for taking advantage of the labor of young individuals without providing remuneration. In 2004, The Blogstar Network was established by Ted Murphy of MindComet. Bloggers were encouraged to join an email list and receive remunerated offers from corporations in exchange for creating specific posts. For instance, bloggers were compensated for writing reviews of fast-food meals on their blogs. Blogstar is widely regarded as the first influencer marketing network.

Murphy succeeded Blogstar with PayPerPost, which was introduced in 2006. This platform compensated significant posters on prominent forums and social media platforms for every post made about a corporate product. Payment rates were determined by the influencer's status. Though very popular, PayPerPost, received a great deal of criticism as these influencers were not required to disclose their involvement with PayPerPost as traditional journalism would have. With the success of PayPerPost, the public became aware that there was a drive for corporate interests to influence what some people were posting to these sites. The platform also incentivized other firms to establish comparable programs.

Despite concerns, marketing networks with influencers continued to grow throughout the 2000s and into the 2010s. The influencer marketing industry was worth as much as $8 billion in 2019, according to estimates from Business Insider Intelligence, which are based on Mediakix data. Evan Asano, the Former CEO and founder of the agency Mediakix, previously spoke with Business Insider and said he believed influencer marketing on Instagram would continue to grow despite likes being hidden.

 2010s 

By the 2010s, the term ""influencer"" described digital content creators with a large following, distinctive brand persona, and a patterned relationship with commercial sponsors. Consumers often mistakenly view celebrities as reliable, leading to trust and confidence in the products being promoted.

A 2001 study from Rutgers University discovered that individuals were using ""internet forums as influential sources of consumer information."" The study proposes that consumers preferred internet forums and social media when making purchasing decisions over conventional advertising and print sources. An influencer's personality strongly impacts their audience's purchasing decision, with those who engage with their audience being more persuasive in encouraging product purchases. Companies today place great importance on feedback and comments received through social media platforms as consumers trust other consumers. Reviews are often relied on to persuade consumers to make a purchase, highlighting the impact of a negative review on a business's revenue.

A typical method of marketing between the influencer and the audience is ""B2C marketing"". B2C marketing, meaning Business-to-Consumer marketing, entails the strategies which a business would undertake to promote themselves and their services directly to their target audiences. This is typically through advertising and creating content through the influencer themselves. The intention is that their followers, who relate or look up to certain influencers, will be more inclined to purchase an item because their favorite ""Internet celebrity"" recommended it. Social media influencers typically promote a lifestyle of beauty and luxury fashion and foster consumer–brand relationships, while selling their own lines of merchandise.

David Rowles explains the methods online influencers employ to increase their audience and brand visibility. Digital branding encompasses all online experiences and necessitates value provision.""

 Self-branding 
Self-branding, also known as personal branding, describes the development of a public image for commercial gain or social or cultural capital. The rise of social media has been exploited by individuals seeking personal fame and product sales. Platforms such as Instagram, Twitch, Snapchat, VSCO, YouTube, and TikTok, are the most common social media outlets on which online influencers attempt to build a following. Fame can be attained through different avenues and media forms, including art, humor, modeling, and podcasts. Marketing experts have concluded that anyone can build websites easily without any technical knowledge or complex coding languages. They can upload text, pictures, and videos instantly from personal computers or phones. With technological barriers diminishing, the web has become the ideal platform for personal branding.

 Student athletes 

Following the National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Alston ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States in 2021, pre-college and college athletes became eligible for student athlete compensation  for use of their personality rights without loss of athletic eligibility and education-related benefits, which broadened the influencer landscape to people who might not yet be celebrities; subsequently, it became common for amateur athletes to use the name, image and likeness of their personal brand as influencers for hire outside of the field of play.

 Income 
In 2023 in the United States, 27 million people were paid content creators. Of those, 12 million did content creation as their full-time profession. 8 million did it as part-time work, and 7 million did it as a hobby. Influencers can make money in various ways, but most of them earn money from endorsements or sponsorships. Social media influencers can use their fame to promote products or experiences to their followers, as a method of providing credibility to products.

Influencers can also expand their source of revenue by creating their own products or merchandise to sell. By doing this, and by using their platform to promote their products to an established audience, influencers can earn money by developing their own reputable brands. Bloggers can feature sponsored posts in social media to make profits. For instance, fashion blogger Chiara Ferragni started as an online blogger, and then gained millions of followers on Instagram. She later created her brand, the Chiara Ferragni Collection. Like many other Instagram celebrities, Ferragni started by charging money per post for promoting brands. She earns revenue from promotional Instagram posts and the sale of her own products. In 2020, a report by venture-capital firm SignalFire stated that the economy spawned by internet creators was the ""fastest-growing type of small business"".

 Marketing 

 Regulations 
Despite the recent emergence of influencer culture, influencer marketing and advertising it is left highly unregulated by existing legislation. This became a prevalent concern when users on social media platforms were finding it difficult to distinguish any differences between advertisements and sponsorships with personal posts. This was evident with the mismanagement of Fyre Festival, where numerous Instagram influencers were sanctioned for their lack of transparency. This led to a massive backlash from the public, who felt the promotion of the event deliberately misled and confused target audiences. As a result, numerous advertising bodies sought to introduce strict regulations and guidelines around influencer marketing. This includes the AANA (Australian Associations of National Advertisers), who states that influencer advertising must be ""clearly distinguishable"".

In August 2024, the Federal Trade Commission voted unanimously to ban marketers from using fake user reviews created by generative artificial intelligence chatbots (such as ChatGPT) and influencers paying for bots to increase follower counts.

 Payments 
Most influencers are paid before the start of a marketing campaign, and others are paid after it ends. Consensus exists about how much an influencer should be paid. Compensation may vary by how many people an influencer can reach, the extent to which they will endorse the product (a deliverable), and the success of their past endorsements have performed.

Top-tier influencers and celebrities may receive a six- or seven-figure fee for a single social-media post. In addition to (or in lieu of) a fee, payment may include free products or services. While top-tier influencers generate attention, only 4% of all influencers make more than $100,000 a year. For influencers with smaller followings, free products or services may be the only form of compensation.  Advertisers are increasingly inclined to see influencers with a small but dedicated follower base as a more efficient use of marketing dollars.

Forrester Research analyst Michael Speyer notes that for small and medium-sized businesses, ""IT sales are influenced by several parties, including peers, consultants, bloggers, and technology resellers.""Speyer, Michael. Identifying IT Buyers’ Hidden Influencers: Finding And Nurturing Your Brand Presence Beyond Your Formal Channels, Forrester Research, 2007. According to Speyer, ""Vendors need to identify and characterize influencers inside their market. This requires a comprehensive influencer identification program and the establishment of criteria for ranking influencer impact on the decision process.""

Categorization
Influencers are categorized by the number of followers they have on social media. They include celebrity endorsements from those with large followings, to niche content creators with a loyal following on social-media platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Their followers range in number from hundreds of millions to 1,000.

Businesses pursue people who aim to lessen their consumption of advertisements, and are willing to pay their influencers more. Targeting influencers is seen as increasing marketing's reach, counteracting a growing tendency by prospective customers to ignore marketing.

Marketing researchers Kapitan and Silvera find that influencer selection extends into product personality. This product and benefit matching is key. For a shampoo, it should use an influencer with good hair. Likewise, a flashy product may use bold colors to convey its brand. If an influencer is not flashy, they will clash with the brand. Matching an influencer with the product's purpose and mood is important.",2025-04-13,"['Social media' 'Internet celebrities' 'Social media influencers'

604,49963,76424527,7700,Mustafa Pehlivanoğlu,"Mustafa Pehlivanoğlu (March 3, 1958 - October 7, 1980), was a Turkish ultranationalist militant. He was tried on August 10, 1978, allegedly for shooting four coffee lounges, killing 5 people and injuring 12, and was sentenced to death on October 18, 1979.

 Background 
Mustafa Pehlivanoğlu was born in Ayaş on March 3, 1958, and was involved in ultranationalist circles. During the Balgat massacre, on August 10, 1978, at around 21.00 in the Balgat district of Ankara, three coffee lounges, usually full of left-wingers, and two coffee lounges, usually full of Idealists, were the target of a drive-by shooting. Five people died, twelve people were injured as a result. In the investigation, it was determined that Pehlivanoğlu and Haydar Şahin, were the ones who carried out the attacks.

 Trial, escape, and execution 
On December 18, 1978, in Ankara, his trial started at the High Criminal Court. In addition to the Balgat Massacre, Mustafa Pehlivanoğlu was also tried for robbing a truck driver for an American factory in Balgat. The prosecutor demanded that he'd be charged with extortion, armed robbery, and murder. Emin Metin, a witness in the incident, said that a week before the massacre, Pehlivanoğlu was the coffee lounge where he was beaten by multiple leftists, and that Pehlivanoğlu said, ""I will make this place your graves."" He was sentenced to death, and his death file was sent to the Turkish Grand National Assembly. Meanwhile, he escaped from the Mamak Military Prison, despite being heavily guarded. Necati Gültekin, Secretary General of the Nationalist Movement Party, said that he ""did not know about the incident and could not comment"". Atilla Sav, President of the Union of Turkish Bar Associations, said, ""you catch him, you punish him, and then he runs away. When this is the case, the situation that deters the crime disappears."" The Prison Director was fired from his job. He was caught in Kütahya on August 16, 1980. In the interrogation, he said that he escaped from prison by digging his way out of the ceiling and wearing civilian clothes he bought. Pehlivanoğlu was sentenced to execution, and after the 1980 Turkish coup d'état when martial law was declared, he was hanged on October 7, 1980, in Mamak Prison.

Idealist sources claim that Pehlivanoğlu was a victim of false accusation, and did not commit the shootings.",2024-03-27,"['1958 births' '1980 deaths' '20th-century Turkish people'

Lichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert Region. Vol 2.

 Morphology 
The lichen forms loosely appressed thalli, reaching diameters of up to 12 cm. Its thallus structure is pinnately or subpinnately lobate, featuring radiating and confluent lobes. Typically measuring between 0.2 and 3 mm wide, these lobes present a flat or convex profile, often displaying concavity towards the tips and occasionally exhibiting a distinctive flabellate shape.

The upper surface of the thallus showcases a spectrum of colors, including various shades of gray, bluish gray, almost white, or stramineous hues. This surface may display a slight pruinose texture or lack a pruina entirely, transitioning into soredia over time. Notably, the presence of polysidiangia is observed, emerging from isidia-like outgrowths, which subsequently rupture to reveal soredia, ultimately forming an apically crateriform appearance.

Distinct pseudocyphellae, both laminal and marginal, are typically confined to the peripheral regions of the lobes, with occasional formations of reticulately confluent patterns. The medulla, predominantly white, often presents an orange hue at its lowest part, particularly towards the lobe tips. In contrast, the lower surface adopts a central black coloration, gradually fading to paler tones towards the lobe tips, and is described as erhizinate.

While apothecia are infrequent, they are found laminal on the thallus, measuring between 0.5 and 1.5 mm wide, featuring a black, slightly grayish pruinose disc. Ascospores, crucial for reproductive structures, are brown, 1-septate, and ellipsoid, with dimensions ranging from 16–22 x 7–9 μm. Pycnidia, immersed in warts, contain bacilliform conidia measuring 4–5 x 0.8–1 μm.

 Chemistry 
In spot test, the upper cortex demonstrates positive reactions to K+ yellow while exhibiting negative reactions to C-, KC-, and P+ yellow. Conversely, the medulla, encompassing both upper and lower parts, shows negative responses to K-, C-, KC-, and P-. Secondary metabolites identified include atranorin within the upper cortex, accompanied by divaricatic acid and a few terpenes in low concentration within the medulla.

 Ecology and distribution 
Dirinaria aegialita thrives within a diverse ecological range, commonly found on bark, wood, and rocks, spanning from sea level to the perimeters of montane rain forests. Its distribution encompasses all tropical regions of both hemispheres, with occasional sightings in the eastern regions of subtropical North America. Particularly prominent within the Sonoran region, it exhibits a notable prevalence in thorn forests, desert transition areas, and sporadically within oak-conifer forests of Baja California, Baja California Sur, Chihuahua, Sinaloa, and Sonora.",2025-02-12,['Lichen species' 'Caliciales' 'Lichens described in 1803'],"['species' 'foliose lichen' 'family' 'Caliciaceae' 'tropical'

607,3391,75075740,6271,Kafr Naffakh,"Kafr Naffakh () is an abandoned Syrian village in the central Golan Heights.

 History 
Sites and artifacts were found in the village that show human settlement as early as the Roman and Hellenistic eras, during which the village sat next to a central route that connected Syrian cities to the Mediterranean coast. During the Roman era, the village was used as a station for providing services to passengers on the main road. Such a station – ""Mutatio"" – was placed approximately every six kilometres along the main roads throughout the Roman Empire. In 2020, an archaeological dig discovered a 1,700-year-old boundary stone on which ""Kfar Naffakh"" was written in Greek letters. This indicates that the village's name during the Byzantine era was ""Naffakh"".

Transhumance shaped settlement in the Golan for centuries because of its harsh winters. The winters ""forced tribespeople until the 19th century to live in hundreds of rudimentary 'winter villages' in their tribal territory. Starting in the second part of the 19th century, villages like Kafr Naffakh became ""fixed and formed the nucleus of fully sedentary life in the 20th century Golan.""Roy Marom, “Sukayk and al-Summāqah: Mamluk Rural Geography in the Northern Jawlān/Golan Heights in the Light of Qāytbāy’s Endowment Deeds,” in Kate Raphael and Mustafa Abbasi (ed.s), The Golan in the Mamluk and Ottoman Periods: an Archaeological and Historical Study: Excavations at Naʿarān and Farj, In Honour of Moshe Hartal, Yigal Ben Ephraim and Shuqri ‘Arraf, Annual of the Nelson Glueck School of Biblical Archaeology Hebrew Union College—Jewish Institute of Religion Volume xiv (2024): 69-70.

During the 19th century, the village was repopulated by Turkmen settlers, who used the ruins of the place to build their houses. Over the years, the village was also inhabited by residents of other origins and by 1960, it had a total of 664 residents. In 1967, with the advance of the IDF in the Golan Heights, the village's residents left their homes and it was abandoned.

During the Syrian rule in the Golan Heights, the village sat on the central route from Quneitra - Daughters of Jacob Bridge, being more or less in the centre of the road. There were centres and bases of the Syrian army in the vicinity of the village, including in Naffakh and Alika. After Israel conquered the Golan Heights in June 1967, the abandoned village served as a temporary settlement nucleus in the Golan Heights. Today, there are several IDF bases in the vicinity of the abandoned village, including Camp Yitzhak (Camp Naffakh).

The ruins of the village are located near the HaShiryon Junction connecting Highway 91 and Route 978, and slightly west of Naffakh is also the junction connecting the Petroleum Road and Highway 91.",2025-01-05,"['Destroyed populated places'

608,37380,76054301,4430,Go Legend,"""Go Legend"" is a song by American rapper Big Sean and American record producer Metro Boomin from their collaborative studio album Double or Nothing (2017). It features American rapper Travis Scott and contains samples from ""Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)"" by Diana Ross.

Background
Big Sean previewed the song during his performance at Lollapalooza in August 2017.

Critical reception
The song received generally negative reviews from music critics. Vince Rick of HotNewHipHop stated in his review of Double or Nothing, ""From the opening track, 'Go Legend', Big Sean and Metro Boomin live up to the album's name, staking it all on a sample of Diana Ross's 'Theme From Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)'. It's the kind of brazen decision that only someone like Sean's big brother Kanye would make, not unlike snatching a crucifix off the altar and proceeding to customize it. But Big Sean isn't afraid of tripping over a classic; if Diana Ross' longing and uncertainty previously yielded fates unknown, Sean has already come to term with his destiny— 'microphone legend, yeah/ Sean a legend'."" Claire Lobenfeld of Pitchfork wrote, ""Why isn't there anyone in the recording studio telling Big Sean that his lyrics are not good? He opens the album with a track called 'Go Legend' where he declares his brother to be like John Legend."" Jordan M. of Sputnikmusic commented ""Travis Scott goes some way toward wrecking whatever replayablity 'Go Legend' night [sic] have had.""

609,19417,75536964,5091,Robert Franz Curry,"Robert Franz Curry (* November 2, 1872, in Boston; † August 23, 1955 in Riederau) was a US-American landscape painter of Impressionism.

 Life 
Curry initially studied at Harvard University in Cambridge before switching to the study of architecture at the Technical University in Stuttgart in 1891. After abandoning his studies, he studied painting from 1893 at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, including with Heinrich Knirr and Carl von Marr. His teachers were important members and founders of the Munich Secession, which saw itself in opposition to the school of Franz von Lenbach. On many trips to Switzerland, Italy (specifically the Amalfi Coast), and the Bavarian mountains, Curry collected his motifs.

 Family 
Curry was the son of a wealthy American wool merchant and later owner of a steel construction company and a foundry, making him financially independent throughout his life. His mother, a pianist, had studied in Leipzig. His brother was the doctor and sailor Manfred Curry. Curry was married to Elisabeth von Wahl, the daughter of a Russian-Baltic sculptor. Their son Frederick (Eric) (1903–1971) also became a painter.

 Painting 

Curry made a name for himself as a landscape painter. Elfriede Ruhrberg described his painting style in 2004 in a publication by the Oberstdorf Beautification Association as follows:  ""In the composition of his paintings, Curry preferred the principle of the diagonal, i.e., the focal point runs from the top right to the bottom left, captured by a counterpoint group in the left half, with the limiting background of the mountains. The images are placed in a tension arc through the bright, nuanced, structured colors of snow and mountains or the contrasting brown-ocher tones of trees and bushes in spring landscapes. Curry succeeds in presenting the traces and paths in the snow to the viewer in a plastic way through the pasty brushstroke."" His paintings are attributed to Realism and Post-Impressionism. He exhibited at the Kunstverein München, the Glass Palace, the art associations in Augsburg, Nuremberg, and Mannheim, in Chur, in France, and in the USA. In 2005, on the occasion of his 50th anniversary, the Villa Jauss in Oberstdorf presented an exhibition of Curry's paintings.

At least 12 of his works were shown at the Große Deutsche Kunstausstellung between 1939 and 1944 as part of the art in Nazi Germany.",2024-02-22,"['German landscape painters' '1872 births' '1955 deaths'

610,33468,75943402,10075,Civ-Alert,"Civ-Alert was the civil defense warning system in the U.S. state of Hawaii from 1960 to 1977. Civ-Alert was established in the wake of the tsunami generated by the 1960 Valdivia earthquake on the Chilean coast, which devastated Hilo. Unlike CONELRAD, the warning system in use in the mainland United States, Civ-Alert consisted of the transmission of civil defense information and instructions from a studio at state Civil Defense headquarters in Diamond Head on existing radio station frequencies; this was important, as no one radio station could cover the entire Hawaiian islands. The Civ-Alert system was a major improvement. It led to the redesign of emergency warnings in the mainland U.S. as a similar system, the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS). Civ-Alert was rebranded as EBS in May 1977.

History
The 1960 Valdivia earthquake, whose tsunami pummeled Hilo and led to the deaths of 65 people, exposed serious deficiencies in the island-wide warning system for natural disasters. The islands' existing warning system had been created in 1946, after a tsunami killed 150, and was described by scientists after Valdivia as a ""horse and buggy"" system that failed to account for advances in tsunami forecasting. Civil Defense responded by conducting a massive overhaul of its warning systems. It earmarked money to install 71 new sirens across the state, as well as $20,000 to establish Civ-Alert, a statewide system to broadcast civil defense information over all Hawaii radio stations. This system was conceived by Jock Fernhead at radio station KPOI.

Civ-Alert was approved for use in November 1960 and began full-time service on December 1, 1960. It was tested for the first time on January 3, 1961, and all Honolulu radio stations received the signal from Civil Defense in Diamond Head; they were equipped with warning lights to make them aware of impending Civ-Alert broadcasts. Civil Defense leaders soon sought authorization to have Civ-Alert supplant CONELRAD, the system used nationwide. CONELRAD depended on stations alternating time at one of two frequencies, 640 or 1240 kHz, on reduced power. This was not sufficient for use in Hawaii because a station operating at reduced power in CONELRAD mode might not be able to reach all of the islands. In July 1961, CONELRAD was formally discontinued in Hawaii.

Civ-Alert suffered issues in warning of a potential tsunami on December 20, 1962. It took ten minutes for Civ-Alert to activate, muddling an already confused warning setup. At one point, two Oahu radio stations were telling listeners it was safe to return to their homes while Civ-Alert continued the alert. Among the plans for improving the civil defense system was adding audible buzzers, in addition to the warning lights already in use, to radio studios to notify stations of incoming announcements. The system's performance was much improved in the wake of the 1965 Rat Islands earthquake in the Aleutian Islands; Civ-Alert went on the air three hours before the tidal wave was predicted to arrive on Oahu. The Honolulu Advertiser editorial board praised the broadcasting of director Roger Coryell, also a veteran newsman, and the network setup which also included DJ Hal Lewis as program director; a cartoon by Harry Lyons called the system ""Hawaii's Paul Revere"". By 1966, Civ-Alert had been expanded to provide notification to TV stations and movie theaters, while audio messages were additionally relayed on Muzak background music systems for broadcast in stores.

The success of Civ-Alert led to the scrapping of CONELRAD on the U.S. mainland. Federal officials investigated the Hawaii system and discontinued CONELRAD in 1963 in favor of the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS). The California state plan for the Emergency Alert System (EAS), successor to the EBS, credits Civ-Alert as ""arguably the parent of the EBS and EAS"". Hawaii was linked to the mainland EBS system in 1967, with five EBS stations on the four major islands. The statewide civil defense alert system continued to go by the Civ-Alert name until May 1977.",2025-01-30,"['Emergency Alert System' 'Disaster preparedness in the United States'

611,26783,75739333,6479,Kurdish horse,"The Kurdish horse (Kurdish: ئەسپی کورد; Hespê Kurd; Persian: اسب کرد; Asb-e Kord) or the Kurd horse, is a horse breed of the Kurds. The horse is native to Greater Kurdistan. It is also considered one of the main horse breeds native to Iran, alongside the Caspian, Turkoman, Assil, and Dareshuri.

 Characteristics 
The Kurdish horse has three strains, the Afshari, the Sanjabi, and the Jaff. The Kurdish horse has a medium height (140 to 155 cm) and a compact, muscular body with sturdy bone structure. It has very thick skin and a dense coat as well as a thick mane and tail. As opposed to other native Iranian horse breeds such as the Turkoman, which have long backs and a skinnier length, the Kurdish horse has a stocky body structure. The Kurdish horse has large eyes that are deep in its socket, and for the most they are not prominent, although some strains of the breed have more prominent eyes. Its eyes are more oval-shaped. The Kurdish horse appears to have a shorter neck, although its neck is of an average height and appears short due to being wide, broad, and muscular. It has muscular shoulders, and a wide chest. It holds its neck in an upright position. The breed is known for having a high tail and head carriage. Its ears are set wide on the poll and are of medium length, however they may appear small due to their thick forelock. Their ears' auricles (pinna) are wide open. The Kurdish horse is an active and passionate breed.

 History 
The Kurdish horse is believed to be descended from an extinct population of horses named ""Nesayee."" As of 2022, the Kurdish horse population in Iran was estimated at 2,700 individuals. The horse was first bred in the province of Kermanshah (also known by Kurds as Kirmaşan), and later was brought to the Kurdish regions of Iraq, Turkey, and Syria. The horse was bred and used by Kurds for several millennia until today. The horse has an ability to survive in moderately-cold climates and mountainous regions, which have made it resistant to harsh environmental conditions.

 In popular culture 

During the 1991 Iraqi uprisings, the Peshmerga (when they were a rebel group rather than an official armed force) rode the Kurdish horses and used them to transport weapons thru the mountains. In 2019, Iran hosted the first National Kurdish Horse Beauty Festival in Ardebil province. A two-day festival dedicated to the breed was held in Kermanshah province in 2023. A festival was also held for it during 2023 in Sulaymaniyah. In May 2024, the third such festival was held to celebrate the breed.https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/34981-Third-Kurdish-horse-festival-featured-competitive,-strong-horses

 Status 
In January 2023, the Kurdish horse was added to the National Intangible Cultural Heritage list of Iran.

In December 2022, Iran announced they were developing a dossier for the horse for a possible inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage list. In November 2023,  Iran and Iraq announced they were seeking a shared UNESCO status for the breed.",2025-04-15,"['Horse breeds originating in Iran' 'Kurdish culture'

612,7335,75176468,13966,Heaton Lodge Junction,"Heaton Lodge Junction is a railway junction on the Trans-Pennine line, which connects  with  via , and the Calder Valley Line through  to Wakefield. The line and junctions were historically important as they connected the industrialised areas of Lancashire and Yorkshire.

 History 
The line through the Heaton Lodge area was first opened in October 1840 as part of the Manchester and Leeds Railway, (later the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway (L&YR)). In 1847, the London North Western Railway's (LNWR) section of railway between Heaton Lodge and Huddersfield opened to traffic, which had an east-facing junction at Heaton Lodge. Initially, the route, which was part of the Standedge Line (the modern Trans-Pennine Line) was to have run through Mirfield on separate tracks, but the L&YR acknowledged that it could not oppose the route, so accepted the LNWR having running powers between Heaton Lodge and Thornhill. Due to a growth in traffic from both companies, the line between Heaton Lodge and Huddersfield was widened to four lines in 1884, and the section eastwards to Thornhill was completed at the same time, with the LNWR later building an independent line on the northern side of the quadrupled track. The  section of line between Heaton Lodge and Mirfield was constrained by a two-track bridge over the River Calder. This was finally enlarged in 1932 into a four-track railway.

Despite the quadrupling of track, the line between Thornhill and Leeds via Dewsbury was still constrained by the two running lines. A secondary line was constructed between Heaton Lodge and Leeds via Gildersome, and became known as the Leeds New Line, opening in 1900.

In the 1930s, the section between Heaton Lodge and Thornhill Junction was fitted with an experimental signalling system installed by the LMS known as ""speed signalling"" and based on an American practice of signalling. The system indicated which direction the train was to take and the speed it was to assume on taking that route. However, the driver could be presented with red, yellow and green lights on the one signal as they approached. A major re-signalling project in the 1969 changed all of this back to normal UK practice. Further rationalisation occurred after the Leeds New Line had closed in 1965. The trackbed of the Leeds New Line, where it burrowed under the Calder Valley Line, was re-instated as a new chord connecting the dive-under line to the east direction of the running lines towards Mirfield. This was completed in 1970. The new chord allowed fast passenger services between Huddersfield and Leeds to use lines separate from those on the Calder Valley Line, so freight trains and passenger trains could remain separate. At the same time, the slow Calder Valley lines west of Heaton Lodge Junction were used for wagon storage. A further fall in traffic saw the double-track dive-under reduced to a single line, and the line between Heaton Lodge and Thornhill rationalised into a reduced three-track railway in 1988, with three platforms at  railway station.

The line and junction is utilised by trains from Grand Central, Northern Trains, and Trans-Pennine Express, carrying on around 50 million passengers a year on average. Freight operators also use the section of line.

 Transpennine Route Upgrade 
As part of the Transpennine Route Upgrade, the junction will be remodelled so that the line between Huddersfield and Thornhill Junction will have four lines. Two fast lines will run on the eastern to the southern side, whilst the slower lines, serving Deighton, Mirfield and , will be on the western and northern side. This part of the TRU project (known as contract W3) will include the restoration of over  of quadruple track (currently at two lines to Thornhill Junction, three to Heaton Lodge Junction, and then two lines to Huddersfield). With the gauge clearance, track reinstatement, the re-siting of Mirfield and Ravensthorpe stations, and the electrification of the route, the final bill for the section between Dewsbury and Huddersfield is expected to be £3 billion (estimated in 2023).

 Early life and education 
Gomez grew up in Brighton, Ontario. He graduated from the University of Toronto with a bachelor's degree in computer science and mathematics. He was pursuing a PhD in computer science from the University of Oxford. He paused his studies to launch Cohere; however, he ultimately was granted the PhD in 2024.

 Career 
In 2017, as a 20 year-old intern at Google Brain, Gomez was one of eight authors of the research paper ""Attention Is All You Need"", which is credited with changing the AI industry and helping lead to the creation of ChatGPT. The paper proposed a novel deep learning architecture called the transformer, that enables machine learning models to analyze large amounts of data for patterns, and then use those patterns to make predictions while leveraging GPU parallelization.  It has been commonly adopted for training large language models and in the development of generative AI. In 2017, Gomez founded FOR.ai, a program to help researchers learn machine learning techniques in a collaborative format, which later became Cohere For AI.  

As a PhD student, Gomez worked as a machine learning researcher at Google Brain. At that time, he co-authored the paper ""One Model to Learn Them All"" about multi-task learning by a single neural network.  

In 2019, Gomez left Google Brain to launch Cohere, an enterprise-focused company that helps businesses implement AI into chatbots, search engines, and other products. He is CEO of the company, which has been valued at over $2 billion. 

Gomez was named to the 2023 Time 100/AI list of the most influential people in the field of artificial intelligence.

Early life
Lady Anne was born at Ellisfield, Hampshire, the second daughter of Gerard Wallop (later the Earl of Portsmouth) and his first wife, Mary Lawrence Post. Her parents were both born in the United States; her paternal grandfather Oliver was a horse breeder in the American West in the late 1800s and remained there even after inheriting the Earldom.

Two months after her birth, her great-grandfather the 7th Earl of Portsmouth died, and her father was styled Viscount Lymington until he inherited the earldom. From 1929–34, he was a Member of Parliament for Basingstoke  parliamentary constituency, with the family home in Farleigh Wallop. Her parents divorced in 1936. The following year, she was one of a selection of aristocratic girls around the same age as the then-Princess Elizabeth, later to be Queen Elizabeth II, who was brought to Buckingham Palace to form the Guides group there. Anne, known by her middle name Camilla, and nicknamed ""Micky"" from this, had become a good friend of Elizabeth by World War II.

When she was 15 and living with her mother in London, their home was bombed; they moved to the Savoy Hotel with her maternal uncle.

Marriage
In 1944, when she was 19, Lady Anne married Lord Rupert Nevill at St George's, Hanover Square. At the time, Rupert was one of the Life Guards serving as the personal bodyguard of King George VI. She was then often known as Lady Rupert Nevill. In the early years of their marriage, they lived at Uckfield House.  They sold it in 1965 (it was subsequently demolished in 1974)Lost Heritage, Ukfield House and moved to Horsted Place, which Anne restored and renovated extensively. When Lord Rupert died in 1982, Anne moved to Glynde and Horsted Place was sold.

They were popular at court, and were sometimes affectionately referred to as ""the little people"", due to both being short. Well-versed as courtiers, they were often handed a role of making lively more dull events at court, and to make people feel more at ease around Elizabeth II at awkward events.

The couple had four children:
 Guy Rupert Gerard Nevill (29 March 1945 – 5 February 1993; aged 47), godson of Elizabeth II; he married Lady Beatrix Mary Lambton, daughter of Antony Lambton, 6th Earl of Durham.
 Angela Isabel Mary Nevill (born 2 January 1948), a bridesmaid at the wedding of Princess Margaret and Antony Armstrong-Jones;Angela Isabel Mary Keating"" married William Keating (died 4 November 1998) on 12 March 1994.
 Christopher George Charles Nevill, 6th Marquess of Abergavenny (born 23 April 1955), married Venetia V. Maynard and had twins. 
 Henrietta Emily Charlotte Nevill (born 21 June 1964), goddaughter of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; married Lt. Col. Timothy Purbrick. They have four children.

Associations
After their childhood friendship, Anne remained close with Elizabeth. In 1946, Anne was the host of the first charity ball that Elizabeth attended. They remained close for the rest of Elizabeth's life, with one insider saying that Anne ""probably knew more royal secrets than any other outsider"". After ascending to the throne, Elizabeth and Philip would still frequently visit the Nevills, ""reportedly [enjoying] a level of freedom during their trips"", including going to places incognito; one friend said that ""the Royal family come nearest to being ordinary people"" at the Nevills' home. Anne's cousin Jean Herbert, Countess of Carnarvon was also a friend of Elizabeth.

Anne and Nevill had also been close to both Princess Margaret and Peter Townsend since before their affair, and ""played a central role"" when Margaret and Townsend separated.

The Nevills hosted Princess Anne at Uckfield House, serving as Princess Anne's home-away-from-home on the weekends while she boarded at the Benenden School in Kent.

In the 2004 Julian Fellowes fictional novel Snobs the character of the Marchioness of Uckfield is based on Anne. Though she rather liked Fellowes, a distant relative, she was unimpressed with how she was depicted. When Anne died, Fellowes said: ""I will miss her tremendously, we had been friends for more than half a century. In fact, she was one of the main influences in my life. Her knowledge, her judgment, her taste, were all extraordinary, and I consider knowing her as one of my greatest blessings.""

 Career 
Mounfield attended Xaverian College in Rusholme, Manchester. He developed an interest in darts, a sport he went on to champion throughout his career. He left school aged sixteen in 1979 and joined the band the Stone Roses (part of the ""Madchester"" music scene) in 1987. Playing on both of the band's albums, Mounfield was in the Stone Roses until they disbanded in 1996. Mounfield used a Rickenbacker 4005 Jackson Pollock-influenced paint-splattered bass guitar in the period after the Stone Roses debut album. He joined Primal Scream after Stone Roses disbanded.

625,43347,76219681,14140,Davao Occidental Tigers–San Juan Knights rivalry,"The rivalry between the Davao Occidental Tigers and San Juan Knights has stretched across multiple leagues in the Philippines, most prominently in the Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League, where the two teams met in the national finals twice in back-to-back seasons (2019 and 2021). The two teams have also faced against each other in other leagues such as FilBasket and the Pilipinas Super League.

As of February 2024, the two teams have played against each other fifteen times, with the Tigers leading the series 8–7.

 History 

 Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League 
The rivalry began during the Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League's 2018–19 season, when both the Davao Occidental Tigers and San Juan Knights joined as expansion teams. Their first regular season match-up came on December 18, 2018, at Rizal Memorial Colleges in Davao City, with the host Tigers winning the game 87–75. Both teams went on to finish the season with identical 20–5 records as they would meet in that season's national finals. The series went back-and-forth as both teams alternated wins leading to a game 5 at RMC. Heading into the final minute, Davao Occidental was leading by three points, but then Jhonard Clarito scored four consecutive points to give San Juan the lead with only eight seconds left. Emman Calo then attempted a two-point field goal that unfortunately missed, giving San Juan their first MPBL championship.

In the following 2019–20 season, their regular season match-up would come January 18, 2020 at the University of Southeastern Philippines. This time around, it was San Juan who won the game 84–65. Following, a one-year suspension of league play due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the two teams would meet in a rematch for the national finals. In game 4, with Davao Occidental leading 2–1, Mark Yee would make a three-pointer to give Davao Occidental the lead and eventually winning the championship, exacting their revenge against their rivals.

 Other leagues 

In time for FilBasket's inaugural tournament, the 2021 Subic Championship, the Tigers would sign John Wilson, who won the 2020 MPBL Most Valuable Player award with San Juan. When both teams met in the elimination round on November 8, 2021, the game went to double overtime as Davao Occidental would win the game 120–115. Heading into the playoffs, both teams once again had identical records (7–3) and would even meet in the semifinals of the tournament. San Juan would win in the knockout game, 85–84, to advance to the finals.

The Davao Occidental Tigers would join the Pilipinas Super League in 2022 for the Pearl of the Orient Cup. In the 2022–23 DUMPER Cup, multiple MPBL teams took part during the league's off-season, including the San Juan Knights, who competed as the San Juan Kings. On February 9, 2023, both teams would play in their first professional meeting at RMC, with San Juan winning the game, 76–71. San Juan would go 15–0 while Davao Occidental went 12–3, marking the first time one team had the lead over the other. Both teams wouldn't meet in the playoffs, however, as the Tigers advanced to the finals while the Kings were eliminated in the semifinals by the Pampanga G Lanterns. Their most recent meeting came on February 29, 2024, in the PSL's 2023–24 President's Cup, with Davao Occidental beating San Juan yet again, 75–73.

626,49581,76412838,4408,Charles Robert Bell Keetley,"Charles Robert Bell Keetley (13 September 1848 – 4 December 1909) was an English physician.

Biography
Keetley was born on 13 September 1848 at Grimsby. He was the son of Robert Keetley by his wife (born Waterland). Both his father and mother came of a seafaring stock. His father, a shipbuilder and a mayor of Grimsby, fell into financial straits. The son, who was mainly brought up by his grandparents and by his uncle, T. B. Keetley, a medical practitioner of Grimsby, was educated at Browne's school there, and acted as ‘surgery help’ or unarticled apprentice to his uncle during the last years of his school life. He then attended the lectures on botany and anatomy at the Hull school of medicine. He entered St. Bartholomew's Hospital in 1871, matriculated at the London University, and in 1874 obtained the two gold medals at the intermediate examination in medicine, one for anatomy, the other for organic chemistry, materia medica, and pharmaceutical chemistry. He took no degree. He was admitted M.R.C.S. England, and F.R.C.S. in 1876. He became L.R.C.P. in 1873. After serving in 1875 as house-surgeon to the Queen's Hospital, Birmingham, and taking general practice at Bungay in Suffolk, he was from 1876 to 1878 an assistant demonstrator of anatomy in the medical school of St. Bartholomew's Hospital.

In 1878 he was elected assistant surgeon at the West London Hospital, and with this hospital he was associated until his death. During his thirty years' service, and mainly by his advice, the hospital grew from a small suburban venture into a great charity, to which was attached a postgraduate medical school of the first importance. At the outset Keetley introduced into the wards and operating theatre the antiseptic methods of modern surgery before they had been adopted to any great extent by the other hospitals in London. He advocated the operation of appendicotomy and wrote a valuable handbook on orthopædic surgery (London, 1900). In 1882 he was foremost in founding, and was the first president of, the West London Medico-Chirurgical Society. He also originated and organised with Mr. Herbert Chambers an army medical civilian reserve, which was afterwards merged into the territorial force as the Third London General Hospital corps.

A slight but incurable deafness and want of business aptitude hampered Keetley's professional success. A keen athlete in early life, he was well known as a football player, boxer, and oarsman; he was a skilful artist and caricaturist with pen and pencil, and had a gift for impromptu rhymes. He died on 4 December 1909 at Brighton, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.

He married Anna, daughter of Henry Holmes Long of the East India Company, but had no children.

Keetley, who was co-editor of the ‘Annals of Surgery,’ vols. i.–xiv. (London and New York, 1885–91), published:

630,28847,75790760,63672,Presidency of Fernando Henrique Cardoso,"The presidency of Fernando Henrique Cardoso began on 1 January 1995, with the inauguration of Fernando Henrique, also known as FHC, and ended on 1 January 2003, when Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took over the presidency.

The main achievements of his administration were the maintenance of economic stability with the consolidation of the Real Plan, the privatization of state-owned companies, the creation of regulatory agencies, the changes to the legislation governing civil servants and the introduction of income transfer programs such as Bolsa Escola.

The FHC government recorded GDP growth of 19.39% (an average of 2.42%) and per capita income growth of 6.99% (an average of 0.87%). He took office with inflation at 22.41% and left at 12.53%.

 Internal policy 

 Economy 
During Fernando Henrique Cardoso's presidency, the Brazilian economy remained stable as a consequence of the inflation control achieved with the Real Plan. Brazil began to experience an economic expansion, especially in the automobile sector. Volkswagen settled in Resende, Rio de Janeiro, Iveco in Minas Gerais and Internacional/Agrale in Rio Grande do Sul. The average annual inflation rate, measured by the Broad National Consumer Price Index (IPCA), was 9.71% in his first term and 8.77% in his second. In 1995, the Ministry of Administration and State Reform, headed by Bresser Pereira, elaborated the Master Plan for State Reform (Portuguese: ), which aimed to create conditions for the reconstruction of public administration on a modern and rational basis.

After the success of the Real Plan, the priority for FHC's administration was to stabilize the currency and promote economic growth. In 1995, the federal government submitted a series of measures for approval by Congress to amend the 1988 Federal Constitution and promote a structural change in Brazil's state structure to adapt it to the new circumstances of the global economy. The initiatives included administrative and social security reform, deregulation of markets, flexibility in labor hiring rules and abolition of state monopolies in the steel, electricity and telecommunications sectors.

In 1999, the tripé macroeconômico, which formed the new basis of economic policy and was composed of a floating exchange rate policy, fiscal targets and inflation targets, was implemented. Fernando Henrique Cardoso privatized numerous sectors considered deficient, such as telecommunications, electricity distribution, mining and finance. The opposition, especially the PT, contested these practices. In eight years, the minimum wage went from 70 to 200 reais in absolute terms. In real terms, its growth was 44.28%. The average GDP growth rate was 2.33% per year and the HDI (Human Development Index) rose from 0.753 in 1995 to 0.789 in 2000.

 Crises 

The FHC government faced several international recessions, such as the Mexican crisis in 1995, the Asian crisis between 1997 and 1998 and the Russian crisis between 1998 and 1999. Brazil was affected by the Argentine crisis, the terrorist attacks in the US on 11 September 2001 and the falsification of the Enron Corporation balance sheets. Internally, it faced a crisis in 1999 when the real depreciated significantly after the Central Bank abandoned the fixed exchange rate regime and adopted a floating exchange rate regime. In 2002, the prediction of Lula's victory in the next presidential election triggered a massive shortfall in hot money and increased the price of the dollar to almost R$4.00.

At every crisis that occurred in other emerging countries, the Brazilian economy suffered an abrupt withdrawal of speculative international capital, forcing Fernando Henrique Cardoso to ask the IMF for help three times. His supporters defended him by saying that upon taking office, Brazil was bankrupt and with practically no currency in dollars, requiring him to compromise on several fronts in order to stabilize the country and pass it on to his successor with properly organized finances.

 Increase in public debt 
During Fernando Henrique Cardoso's first term in office, the imbalance led to an increase in public debt which, at present values, stands at around R$22.8 billion, according to calculations based on data from the Central Bank. On 1 January 1995, the public sector owed R$153.163 billion at then current values. After three consecutive years of public deficit, the debt closed 97 at R$306.494 billion. Between 1995 and 1998, the public sector spent more than it collected, which created a primary deficit of R$7.22 billion. Considering the variation in the economy's basic interest rate since 1995, the interest expenses resulting from this indebtedness reached R$15.58 billion.

 Fiscal Responsibility Law (LRF) 
Approved by Fernando Henrique Cardoso on 4 May 2000, and published in the Federal Official Gazette the following day, the Fiscal Responsibility Law (LRF) requires that finances be presented detailed to the Court of Accounts (Federal, State or Municipal). If the accounts are rejected, an investigation into the responsibility of the Executive branch bodies and their members for any irregularities is launched, which can result in fines or bans on candidates running for election. Although the Executive is primarily responsible for public finances, the Legislative and Judicial branches are also subject to this rule.

The LRF also introduced a limit on personnel spending. The federal government is allowed to spend up to 50% of current net revenue, while states, municipalities and the Federal District can spend up to 60%. If spending reaches 95% of the established limit, it becomes forbidden to grant advantages, create positions and jobs and pay overtime. Before the law, the federal government had no mechanism to measure the country's total indebtedness.

 Health 

Fernando Henrique Cardoso's administration was characterized by structural changes in the Brazilian health system. The Basic Operational Standard 96 () and the Operational Standard for Health Care () were published, which contributed to the decentralization of the SUS. The creation of the Provisional Contribution on Financial Transactions () and the approval of Constitutional Amendment 29, which better defined the participation of the three spheres of government in the financing of the SUS and established minimum percentages of their revenues to be invested in public health actions and services, also stand out.

The Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária - ANVISA) and the Brazilian Supplementary Health Agency (Agência Nacional de Saúde Suplementar - ANS) were created to improve Brazil's management and performance in health care, and to comply with the Health Plans Law, respectively. The period was characterized by intense debates on supplementary health and the regulation of health plans.

The approval of the Basic Care Budget (Piso de Atenção Básica - PAB), a regular and automatic transfer of federal funds, helped promote initiatives such as the Family Health Program (Programa Saúde da Família). The Project for the Reduction of Infant Mortality (Projeto para Redução da Mortalidade Infantil - PRMI), as part of the Solidarity Community Program (Programa Comunidade Solidária), the intensification of measures to combat cigarette consumption and the approval of Law No. 9.313, which determines the free distribution of antiretroviral treatment (ARV) to HIV/AIDS sufferers, are also noteworthy.

 Environmental policy 
Deforestation in the Amazon increased during the first administration of Fernando Henrique Cardoso. In 1995, PRODES/INPE recorded the highest rate since 1988, with 29,059 square kilometers of cleared area. As a solution, the government raised the legal reserve area for rural properties in the Amazon from 50% to 80% and banned the cutting of mahogany and virola for two years, which limited logging, one of the activities responsible for deforestation in the region.

In 1998, large and extensive fires occurred in Roraima, which led to the implementation of the Program for the Prevention and Control of Burning and Forest Fires in the Arc of Development (Programa de Prevenção e Controle às Queimadas e Incêndios Florestais no Arco do Desenvolvimento - Proarco), aimed at reducing the practice of burning areas for pasture and plantations.

Brazil participated actively in the development of the Kyoto Protocol, an agreement signed by the signatory countries of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, which set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions applicable exclusively to developed countries, considered to be the main contributors to the accumulation of emissions in the atmosphere since the Second Industrial Revolution. Developed countries also committed to financing the adoption of ""clean"" technologies by developing countries. The Brazilian delegation contributed to the creation of the Clean Development Mechanism, the basis for the creation of a global carbon market with the aim of stimulating the financing of projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The FHC administration created the Brazilian Climate Change Forum (Fórum Brasileiro de Mudanças Climáticas) to carry out studies, advise the president and mobilize society's attention to the phenomenon identified in successive IPCC reports. The main laws associated with environmental policies created during the FHC government were:

 National Water Resources Policy (Política Nacional de Recursos Hídricos - PNRH): established by the Water Law of 1997 and regulated by the National Water Agency (Agência Nacional de Águas - ANA), created in 2000. It introduced a national water resources management system and river basin committees and defined water as a public good and a scarce resource whose use must be charged to private individuals;
 Environmental Crimes Law: established sanctions that enabled the implementation and effective enforcement of the entire set of legislation related to the environment;
 National System of Conservation Units Law: defined 12 categories of Conservation Units with different degrees of preservation and sustainable use to improve their integrated planning.

 Sports 

The FHC government was responsible for creating the Extraordinary Ministry of Sports in 1995, with Pelé as its first minister. Under his guidance, the General Sports Law, also known as the Pelé Law, was created to deal with the democratization of sporting activities, freedom to practice sports and safety for practitioners of any sport. In 2019, the ministry was abolished by Jair Bolsonaro, but was reactivated by the Lula administration in 2023.

 Education 
The FHC government created and implemented the Educational Information and Evaluation System (Sistema de Informações e Avaliação Educacional) in order to provide information and evaluate the quality of education at all levels and modalities. The government focused on universalizing primary education through the Fund for the Maintenance and Development of Primary Education and the Valorization of the Teaching Profession (Fundo de Manutenção e Desenvolvimento do Ensino Fundamental e Valorização do Magistério - FUNDEF), which allocated compulsory spending on education to primary education and distributed the funds to the municipalities. Important laws and documents designed to organize, plan and create coherence in Brazil's educational policy were produced, such as the Law of Guidelines and Bases and the National Curriculum Parameters in 1997 and the National Education Plan in 2001.

 Social policies 

In 1995, the Brazilian delegation, led by First Lady Ruth Cardoso, participated in the Beijing Conference organized by the United Nations. The event established an action program for gender equality and set a timetable for monitoring its implementation every five years. In the same year, the first legislation on quotas for women in elections in Brazil was approved with a minimum percentage of women candidates.

The FHC government also launched a program to combat violence against women, promoting the expansion of specialized women's police stations and shelters. In the second term, gender discrimination in the job market was banned by law and sexual harassment was typified and penalized. The 1916 Civil Code was replaced in 2002 to reflect the principle of equal rights and obligations between men and women in family relationships, including reproductive planning. In 2002, FHC created the State Secretariat for Women's Rights (Secretaria de Estado dos Direitos da Mulher - Sedim).

In 1995, the Brazilian Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Travesti, Transsexual and Intersex Association (Associação Brasileira de Lésbicas, Gays, Bissexuais, Travestis, Transexuais e Intersexos - ABGLT) was created to unite the different organizations and groups of the movement nationwide. The first Gay Pride Parade, now known as the LGBT Pride Parade, was organized by the association.

The FHC government created Laws No. 10.048 and No. 10.098, which established issues relating to priority service and basic standards and criteria for promoting accessibility for people with disabilities or reduced mobility, respectively. The National Policy for the Integration of People with Disabilities (Política Nacional para a Integração da Pessoa Portadora de Deficiência) and the National Health Policy for People with Disabilities (Política Nacional de Saúde da Pessoa Portadora de Deficiência) were also implemented. The Brazilian Sign Language (Libras) was recognized as an official language.

In 1995, the International Labour Organization (ILO), in partnership with the federal government, sent a delegation to Brazil to study the problem of racial discrimination in the labor market. Initiatives such as the Brazil, Gender and Race Program (Programa Brasil, Gênero e Raça), aimed at combating racism in labor relations, emerged from this project. In the same year, the Zumbi dos Palmares March against Racism, for Citizenship and Life was held in Brasilia to commemorate the 300th anniversary of Zumbi's death.

The Interministerial Working Group for the Valorization of the Black Population (Grupo de Trabalho Interministerial para Valorização da População Negra - GTI) and the National Coordination for the Articulation of Black Rural Quilombola Communities (Coordenação Nacional de Articulação das Comunidades Rurais Negras Quilombolas - Conaq) were also created. In 1996, the FHC government launched the 1st National Human Rights Program (PNDH) with proposals aimed at combating racial discrimination. In the same year, discussions began on specific affirmative action for Brazil at the Multiculturalism and Racism Seminar.

 Relations with the National Congress 

During his election campaign in 1994, Fernando Henrique Cardoso was supported by the Liberal Front Party (PFL) and the Brazilian Labor Party (PTB). Initially, his vice-president would be Guilherme Palmeira, a PFL candidate, but he was replaced by Marco Maciel after accusations of favoritism from a contractor. Upon winning the election, his coalition secured 36% and 30% of the disputed seats in the House and Senate respectively. After the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) joined, the ruling base increased to 57% and 58%. The PFL received the Ministries of Mines and Energy and the Environment, the PMDB received the Secretariat for National Integration, the PTB received the Ministry of Agriculture and the PSDB got the Ministry of Planning, Justice and the economic team that implemented the Real Plan.

At the end of 1995, Fernando Henrique Cardoso chose Francisco Dornelles, a deputy from the Brazilian Progressive Party (PPB), to occupy the Ministry of Development, Industry, Trade and Services, which he assumed in May 1996. FHC claimed that this represented a formal joining of the PPB in the government, but relevant members of the party including Paulo Maluf criticized him. In 1997, FHC renewed the alliance with the PMDB and PFL in Congress, supporting the election of a PMDB deputy from São Paulo, Michel Temer, and a PFL senator from Bahia, Antônio Carlos Magalhães.

In 1997, the constitutional amendment allowing re-election to executive positions was approved; the PSDB, PFL, PTB, PMDB and PPB supported the re-election of Fernando Henrique Cardoso. In 1999, the federal government supported the nomination of Michel Temer and ACM to the presidency of the Lower and Upper Houses of Congress respectively.

In 2000, there was a conflict between Fernando Henrique Cardoso and his allies in Congress. He promised that he would veto the candidacy of Aécio Neves for the presidency of the Chamber of Deputies and that he would support Inocêncio de Oliveira, a PFL deputy. He also claimed neutrality in the Federal Senate, where Jader Barbalho, from the PMDB and ACM's rival, was articulating his election to the presidency of the House. However, Aécio Neves formed a strong alliance in the Chamber of Deputies and FHC refused to intervene. The PFL threatened to leave the coalition, but FHC offered them an ultimatum: they could either retreat or he would exonerate the ministries that the PFL held at the time. The PFL remained in the coalition, but its relationship with the federal government deteriorated. In 2001, Aécio Neves was elected President of the Chamber of Deputies and Jader Barbalho was appointed President of the Senate.

In 2002, the PFL and PTB left the ruling coalition and handed over their ministries to launch presidential candidates. The PMDB still remained allied with the government and supported former Minister of Health José Serra's candidate for the presidency, with the PMDB deputy from Espírito Santo, Rita Camata, as his vice-president.

 Impeachment attempts 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso suffered seventeen accusations which could lead to his impeachment if proven. The complaints were filed more frequently during his second term, but were dismissed.

 Appointments to the Supreme Court 
As president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso appointed the following judges to the Supreme Court:

 1997 - Nelson Jobim;
 2000 - Ellen Gracie;
 2002 - Gilmar Mendes.

 Foreign policy 

In 1998, the FHC government, supported by the Prime Minister of Cape Verde, Carlos Veiga, advocated for the expansion of the United Nations Security Council to include five more permanent seats. In 2002, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a declaration of support for Brazil's inclusion onto the council, and became the first leader of a country with a permanent seat to do so.

During the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Fernando Henrique Cardoso phoned US President George W. Bush to express his condolences. A few days later, the Brazilian government's proposal to coordinate the Latin American response to the attack by invoking the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (TIAR) was approved at the XXIII Meeting of Consultation of Foreign Ministers of the Organization of American States. In November 2001, FHC criticized the USA PATRIOT Act, and declared shortly after its enactment that ""if, in order to defeat terror, we have to give up individual freedoms, guarantees of civil rights, the prohibition of the use of torture, then our victory will really be nonsense"".

In October 2001, Fernando Henrique became the first Latin American president to address the French National Assembly. In his speech, he criticized developed countries, terrorism and defended the creation of the State of Palestine. A month later, he gave the opening speech at the UN General Assembly, where he again advocated for the creation of a Palestinian state that coexisted with Israel. The president said that the UN owed a ""moral debt"" to the Palestinians and that the creation of a new state was an ""unavoidable task"".

FHC's foreign policy was based on multilateralism, universalism and integration, especially on regional level. The strategy aimed to position Brazil as a global player on the international stage in an age of globalization. In 1998, Fernando Henrique Cardoso signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

 MERCOSUR 

The FHC government prioritized MERCOSUR on the agenda as an innovative idea in South America, despite its open regionalism concept. The main objective of Brazil and the other member states of the bloc was to promote and guarantee lasting and sustainable development. Within the association, Brazil spoke out about the crises in Paraguay and Venezuela and the implementation of a democratic clause. It was also involved in the development of the free trade agreement between MERCOSUR and the European Union, in alliances with the World Trade Organization and in increasing bilateral relations with other countries. Fernando Henrique Cardoso aspired to insert the trade bloc into the international economy through open regionalism and to strengthen the association. However, MERCOSUR faced a crisis in mid-1998, aggravated by the devaluation of the real the following year.

Brazil has engaged in the search for new economic relations and strategic partners such as China and the United States. According to the FHC government, MERCOSUR was a strategy to attract the world's attention, enabling Brazil to participate more actively in the decision-making process on important world issues. Its objectives, characterized by presidential diplomacy during this period, were to increase external credibility and internal stability.

 Crises and accusations of corruption 

 Re-election 
In 1997, the constitutional amendment allowing re-election to executive positions was approved. In the same year, wiretaps published by Folha de S. Paulo revealed conversations between congressman Ronivon Santiago and another voice identified in the newspaper as Senhor X. In the messages, Santiago stated that he and four other deputies had received 200.000 reais from the governor of Acre, Orleir Cameli, to vote in favor of the amendment.

Based on the recordings, the government's opposition, led by the PT, began to accuse Fernando Henrique Cardoso of purchasing the votes of members of parliament. He claimed that several politicians benefited from the amendment, as governors and mayors could also be re-elected, and that the wiretaps revealed the involvement of a governor and his deputies, not the federal government. The case was investigated by the Constitution, Justice and Citizenship Committee (Comissão de Constituição e Justiça e de Cidadania), whose session lasted only a few hours; it was addressed years later by the Mensalão CPI. After the investigation, deputies Ronivon Santiago and João Maia resigned their seats, supposedly to avoid being impeached. In both circumstances, Fernando Henrique Cardoso's involvement could not be proven.

 Blackout crisis 
Between 2000 and 2001, an energy shortage plan was implemented in several regions of Brazil, except for the South, which benefited from heavy rains. The severity of the drought in the reservoirs and the lack of investment in energy generation and transmission were the main causes of the problem. At the time, documents proved that the FHC government was aware of the power shortage risk, but the team said it was surprised by the advanced stage of the situation. With no management capacity, it was necessary to compulsorily reduce consumption.

The Brazilian government stipulated benefits for consumers who fulfilled the goal and punishments for those who failed to reduce their electricity consumption. It has also introduced a system of thermoelectric power stations that work as a second option during long droughts. Until then, Brazil was totally dependent on the generation of energy from water resources. At the end of 2001, rainfall levels improved and rationing was suspended in February 2002.

 Post-government impressions 

In January 2003, journalist Fernando Rodrigues published an article about the preliminary approval of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's administration and the impressions left by the FHC government, and stated that ""Fernando Henrique Cardoso had great peaks of popularity. However, judging by his beginning and his end, he left voters with the impression that he was an average president"".

In April 2014, Datafolha published a survey on the influence of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Lula, Joaquim Barbosa and Marina Silva on voters' decisions. Among more than 2,000 respondents, 12% said they would support a candidate backed by FHC and another 23% said they probably would vote. The rejection of a candidate nominated by him was 57%, the highest among the four possible electoral candidates.

In May 2014, Folha de S. Paulo published an index made by Datafolha on the evaluation of presidents since the 1990s. The results were compiled using a calculation that summarizes the popularity of each presidential term, with a scale between zero and two hundred points, where below one hundred points the evaluation was considered negative. Fernando Henrique Cardoso's first term was the fourth best with 134 points, behind Lula's two terms and Dilma Rousseff's first term. His second term scored 81 points, ahead only of the period when Fernando Collor governed the country.",2025-03-09,"['Presidencies of Brazil' '1995 establishments in Brazil'

Critical response
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 53% of 17 critics' reviews are positive.

Film critic Lisa Kennedy from Variety wrote in her review:  ""The drama “If Not Now, When?” owes more to Waiting to Exhale than to the women-centric films of Tyler Perry. That's a good thing, as well as intentional on the part of its first-time feature directors, actors Meagan Good and Tamara Bass."" Katie Walsh from Los Angeles Times also give it positive review praising Bass' writing and performances, particularly Meagan Holder' performance. Monica Castillo from RogerEbert.com gave it a negative review writing: ""Between its amateurish direction, pedestrian cinematography, and overly plotted script, the narrative and visuals don’t coalesce into a story that feels restorative, cathartic, or even joyful.""

633,50348,366823,23308,Shimonoseki campaign,"The  was a series of military engagements in 1863 and 1864, fought to control the Shimonoseki Straits of Japan by joint naval forces from the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, and the United States, against the Japanese feudal domain of Chōshū, which took place off and on the coast of Shimonoseki, Japan.

Background

Despite efforts of appeasement by the Tokugawa shogunate to establish an atmosphere of peaceful solidarity, many feudal daimyōs remained bitterly resentful of the shogunate's open-door policy to foreign trade. Belligerent opposition to European and American influence erupted into open conflict when the Emperor Kōmei, breaking with centuries of imperial tradition, began to take an active role in matters of state and issued on March 11 and April 11, 1863, his ""Order to expel barbarians"" (攘夷実行の勅命 – Jōi jikkō no chokumei).

The Chōshū clan, under the daimyō Mōri Takachika, began to take action to expel all foreigners after the deadline of the 10th day of the 5th month, according to the traditional Japanese calendar. Openly defying the shogunate, Mōri ordered his forces to fire without warning on all foreign ships traversing Shimonoseki Strait. This strategic but treacherous 600-meter waterway separates the islands of Honshū and Kyūshū and provides a passage connecting the Inland Sea with the Sea of Japan.

Even before tensions escalated in Shimonoseki Strait, foreign diplomats and military experts, notably U.S. Minister to Japan Robert Pruyn and U.S. Navy Captain David McDougal had been aware of the precarious state of affairs in Japan. McDougal wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles, dated June 12, 1863, stating, ""General opinion is that the government of Japan is on the eve of revolution, the principal object of which is the expulsion of foreigners.""

""Revere the Emperor and expel the barbarians!""

The Chōshū clan was equipped with mostly antiquated cannons firing cannonballs, but also some modern armament, such as five  Dahlgren guns, which had been presented to Japan by the United States, and three steam warships of American construction: the bark Daniel Webster of six guns, the brig Lanrick, or Kosei, with ten guns, and the steamer Lancefield, or Koshin, of four guns.  The Battle of the Straits of Shimonoséki

The first attack occurred on June 25, 1863, soon after the Imperial ""Order to expel barbarians"" came into effect. The U.S. merchant steamer SS Pembroke, under Captain Simon Cooper, was riding at anchor outside Shimonoseki Strait when it was intercepted and fired upon by two European-built warships belonging to the rebel forces.

The crew of one enemy vessel taunted the frantic American seamen with a loud and unnerving cry: ""Revere the Emperor and expel the barbarians!"" ( sonnō jōi). Under incessant cannon fire, Pembroke managed to get underway and escape through the adjacent Bungo Strait with only slight damage and no casualties.

Upon arrival in Shanghai, Cooper filed a report of the attack and dispatched it to the U.S. Consulate in Yokohama, Japan. The next day, the French naval dispatch steamer Kien Chan was also riding at anchor outside the strait, when rebel Japanese artillery atop the bluffs surrounding Shimonoseki opened fire on her. Kien Chan sustained damage to its engine and suffered four casualties before escaping to the open ocean.

On July 11, despite warnings from the crew of the Kien Chan, the 16-gun Dutch warship Medusa cruised into Shimonoseki Strait. Her skipper, Captain François de Casembroot, was convinced that Lord Mōri Takachika would not dare fire on his vessel due to the strength of his ship and longstanding relations between the Netherlands and Japan.

However, Mōri did just that, pounding Medusa with more than thirty shells and killing or wounding nine seamen. De Casembroot returned fire and ran the rebel gauntlet at full speed, fearful of endangering the life of the Dutch Consul General, who was on board. Within a short time, the Japanese warlord had managed to fire on the flags of most of the nations with consulates in Japan.

Battle of Shimonoseki Straits

In the morning of July 16, 1863, under sanction by Minister Pruyn, in an apparent swift response to the attack on the Pembroke, the U.S. frigate USS Wyoming, under Captain McDougal, sailed into the strait and single-handedly engaged the U.S.-built but poorly manned local fleet for almost two hours before withdrawing. McDougal sank two enemy vessels and severely damaged another one, along with inflicting some forty Japanese casualties. The Wyoming suffered a significant amount of damage, with four crew dead and seven wounded, one later dying of his injuries. The two Japanese steamers sunk by the Wyoming were raised again by Chōshū in 1864 and attached to the harbour of Hagi.

Campaign

First battle, July 20, 1863

On the heels of McDougal's engagement, on July 20, the French Navy retaliated for the attack on their merchant ship. The French force consisted of marines and two warships, the aviso Tancrède and the Admiral's flagship, Sémiramis. With 250 men, under Captain Benjamin Jaurès, they swept into Shimonoseki and destroyed a small town, together with at least one artillery emplacement.

The intervention was supported by the French plenipotentiary in Japan, Gustave Duchesne de Bellecourt, but the French government, once informed, strongly criticized their representatives in Japan for taking such bellicose steps, for the reason that France had much more important military commitments to honour in other parts of the world, and could not afford a conflict in Japan.Medzini, p.44 Duchesne de Bellecourt would be relieved from his position in 1864.

Jaurès was also congratulated by the shogunate for taking such decisive steps against anti-foreign forces, and was awarded a special banner.Medzini, p.46

Diplomatic negotiations

Meanwhile, the Americans, French, British and Dutch feverishly opened diplomatic channels to negotiate the reopening of the passage to the Inland Sea. Months dragged by with no end in sight to the growing dilemma. By May 1864, various bellicose Japanese factions had destroyed thousands of dollars in foreign property, including homes, churches and shipping. This wanton destruction included the U.S. Legation in Edo, which housed Minister Robert Pruyn.

Throughout the first half of 1864, as Shimonoseki Strait remained closed to foreign shipping, threats and rumors of war hung in the air, while diplomatic efforts remained deadlocked. Then the British Minister to Japan, Sir Rutherford Alcock, discussed with his treaty counterparts such as American Minister Robert Pruyn and Dutch Minister Dirk de Graeff van Polsbroek, the feasibility of a joint military strike against Mōri.

They were soon making preparations for a combined show of force. Under the wary eyes of the Japanese, fifteen British warships rode anchor alongside four Dutch vessels, while a British regiment from Hong Kong augmented their display of military might. The French maintained a minimal naval presence, with the bulk of their forces in Mexico trying to bolster Emperor Maximilian's unstable regime.

The U.S., engaged in its Civil War, limited itself to demonstrate diplomatic and minimal military support for the allies. In the meantime, Mōri procrastinated in negotiations by requesting additional time to respond to the Allied demands, a response unacceptable to the treaty powers. The allies decided that the time for united action had arrived.

Despite retaliatory action from the treaty powers, another attack occurred in July 1864 when the rebel forces fired upon the U.S. steamer Monitor after she entered a harbor for coal and water. This provoked further outrage, even after a British squadron delivered a multi-national ultimatum to Mōri, threatening military force if the strait was not opened.

Final battle, September 5–6, 1864

On August 17, 1864, a squadron consisting of nine British (, Conqueror, Tartar, Leopard, Barrosa, Perseus, Argus, Coquette, and Bouncer), four Dutch (Djambi, Metalen-Kruis, Medusa, and Amsterdam), and three French warships (Tancrède, Sémiramis, and Dupleix), together with 2,000 soldiers, marines and sailors, all under the command of Admiral Sir Augustus Leopold Kuper of the Royal Navy, steamed out of Yokohama to open Shimonoseki Strait.

The U.S. chartered steamer  accompanied the operation in a token show of support. The two-day battle that followed on September 5 and 6 did what the previous operations could not; it destroyed the Chōshū Domain's ability to wage war on the Western powers. Unable to match the firepower of the international fleet, and amid mounting casualties, Takasugi Shinsaku negotiated peace with the four Western powers and Chōshū forces finally surrendered two days later on September 8, 1864.

Allied casualties included 72 killed or wounded; although Ernest Satow describes only 8 killed and 30 wounded for the British and two damaged British ships. A full account of the battle is contained in Ernest Satow's A Diplomat in Japan. Satow was present as a young interpreter for the British admiral, Augustus Kuper on the British flagship HMS Euryalus, commanded by Captain J. H. I. Alexander. It was also the action at which Duncan Gordon Boyes won his Victoria Cross (VC) at the age of seventeen. Satow described Boyes as receiving the award ""for conduct very plucky in one so young."" Another VC winner at Shimonoseki was Thomas Pride, and the third was the first American to win the medal, William Seeley. De Casembroot wrote his account of the events in De Medusa in de wateren van Japan, in 1863 en 1864.

The stringent accord, drawn up in the wake of the ceasefire and negotiated by U.S. Minister Pruyn, included an indemnity of $3,000,000 from the Japanese, an amount equivalent to the cost of about 30 steamships at that time.Satow, p86 The Tokugawa shogunate proved unable to pay such an amount, and this failure became the basis of further foreign pressure to open Japanese ports; Japan was forced to choose between paying compensation of three million piastres and opening another port on the Inland Sea. The harbour of Hyōgo was opened to foreign trade, and customs tariffs were lowered uniformly to 5%.Satow, p145 In 1883, twenty years after the first battle to reopen the strait, the United States returned $785,000.87 to Japan, which represented its share of the reparation payment.

Aftermath

Right after the foreign interventions, the Shogunal government also launched its own preparations for a punitive expedition against Chōshū, the First Chōshū expedition. The expedition was aimed at punishing the 1864 Kinmon incident in which Chōshū forces attacked Shogunal forces in Kyoto. The expedition was however cancelled after a compromise was brokered, involving the beheading of the leaders of the rebellion.

At the same time as this campaign, the British Royal Navy engaged Satsuma samurai at the Bombardment of Kagoshima, one of the several engagements of the Japanese conflict of 1863 and 1864.

Historical significance

Closely resembling the series of little conflicts fought by the European powers in Asia, Africa and elsewhere during the nineteenth century, the troubles in Japan seemed to exemplify their gunboat diplomacy, a prevalent tool in imperialism. Bitter resentment against foreign influence made the Chōshū clan feel justified in engaging in acts of military provocation in defiance of their own government.

While it was bitterly embroiled in the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln's government was carefully watched by the world for signs of weakness and indecision. The actions of USS Wyoming made it the first foreign warship to offensively uphold treaty rights with Japan; this fact coupled with the possibility that the events would mire the U.S. in a foreign war made the battle of Shimonoseki a significant engagement.

While the battles of Shimonoseki Strait were mere footnotes in the histories of the European powers, an interesting aspect of the affair was the resourcefulness displayed by the Japanese. The feudal Japanese had not set eyes on a steam-powered ship until Commodore Perry's arrival only a decade before USS Wyomings battle. Yet they had rapidly advanced in such a short period of time.

The Shimonoseki city government in 2004, in recognition of the importance of the bombardment in Japanese history, placed several life-size replicas of the guns used by Chōshū. The replicas are made of hollow steel and include coin-operated sound effects and smoke from the barrels.",2025-04-09,"['Conflicts in 1863' 'Conflicts in 1864' 'Naval battles involving France'

 Biography 
Iwamoto Chizuna was born into a samurai family in 1858.

In 1879, Iwamoto graduated from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and eventually achieved the rank of . In 1887, he was discharged from the Army on account of his association with members of the Freedom and People's Rights Movement including Inukai Tsuyoshi.

In 1892, he moved to Siam and devoted himself to encouraging economic and cultural ties between Japan and Siam. He also visited Luang Phrabang.

Iwamoto and  founded the  with financial support from Chaophraya Surasakmontri. The society was later reorganized as the . According to Ishibashi, the long-term goals of the company included, among other things, ""establish[ing] a latent Japanese influence [in Siam]"" and ""install[ing] Japanese in the Siamese government"".

Before Iwamoto returned home to recruit Japanese peasants for the colonization project, Surasakmontri gave him a golden sword to be sharpened in Japan. The Siam Colonization Company ended in disaster with many of the Japanese immigrants winding up dead or enslaved as coolies.

638,12456,75332164,25109,Saskatchewan Conservation House,"The Saskatchewan Conservation House (211 Rink Ave, Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada) is an early exemplar of energy-efficient building construction that introduced best practices for addressing air leakage in houses. It was designed in response to the energy crisis of the 1970s at the request of the Government of Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan Conservation House pioneered the use of superinsulation and airtightness in passive design and included one of the earliest heat recovery systems. The house did not require a furnace, despite prairie winter temperatures as low as  at night.

In 1977, when it was built at 211 Rink Avenue in the Walsh Acres neighborhood of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, the house was the world's most airtight house. The cost of the electricity to heat the house was estimated as $30–40 for a year. The house's building envelope continues to perform as designed, more than 40 years later.

For its first two years, the Saskatchewan Conservation House could be viewed by the public as a model house. In 1978 as many as 1,000 visitors a week visited it. The Saskatchewan Conservation House influenced the development of energy efficiency building codes both in Canada and internationally. It shaped the field of energy-efficient construction, including passive solar building design and the German passive house. In April 2015, Germany's Passive House Institute gave its designers a Pioneer Award for the design and construction of the house.

 Project 
In response to the energy crisis of the 1970s, the Government of Saskatchewan asked the Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) to design and build a solar house that would be ""appropriate for Saskatchewan"". The house would have to be capable of staying warm despite short winter days and night-time winter temperatures of .

A committee was formed with participation from the Saskatchewan Research Council, the University of Saskatchewan, the Building Research Division of the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, and others. Members included R.W. Besant, Rob Dumont, Dave Eyre, Harry Filson, Bill Gibbons, George Green, Hendrik Grolle, Dave Jennings, Garry Marvin, Deryl Thomson, and lead engineer Harold Orr.

Design
One of the first steps taken by Orr's team was to estimate the energy requirements of powering a standard 1970s house with solar power. Their calculations showed that the water-based energy storage technology of the time was inadequate to meet the needs of such a house. The team chose a different approach, that of radically reducing the house's energy demand.

The total energy consumption of a house reflects several factors relating to its building envelope: (1) heat loss through windows, walls, and ceiling, (2) heat loss through the basement, and (3) air leakage.

As one of the principal designers of the Saskatchewan Conservation House, Orr suggested a radical increase in insulation of the walls, ceiling and foundation, and the use of airtight construction techniques. Orr has compared the difference between the two approaches to designing a coffeemaker vs. designing a thermos bottle. A coffeemaker keeps things warm while it is plugged in and turned on, while a thermos stays warm once it is filled without adding more energy.
The resulting house incorporated three key elements: superinsulation, extreme airtightness, and one of the first heat-recovery ventilators.

At a time when most Canadian houses had  walls with an insulation R-value of r-8, the Saskatchewan Conservation House had  walls with r-40 insulation and a roof with r-60 insulation, increasing the house's insulation to approximately six times compared to the standard. Rather than having a basement, it was raised off the ground to further prevent heat loss to the ground. The raised floor system included a crawl space with r-20 insulation. Orr estimated that suspending the floor above the soil level could mitigate 80 percent of the downward heat loss.

At a time when single-panel windows were the norm and high-grade windows were r-2, the Saskatchewan Conservation House used triple-glazed windows in deep window enclosures. The designers also tried adding a system of shutters that could be used to prevent heat loss, but the shutters were not particularly successful. The house was laid out to take advantage of the Sun when possible, with living accommodations and windows facing south. Large trees were planted to the north to provide a wind buffer, while the south side was left clear to the Sun.

To prevent air leakage and achieve extreme airtightness, Orr and his colleagues installed a vapor barrier themselves. Local contractors did not have the expertise they needed for their experimental technique. They built a double wall, using the outer wall for the structure and placing the vapor barrier on the internal wall, then adding inexpensive blown mineral fibre for insulation.

Because the house was extremely air-tight, the designers built an air-to-air heat exchanger to move fresh air into the house through a series of baffles. On the other side of the baffles, stale indoor air was pushed out. The design transferred heat from the warm exhaust air being released to the cold incoming air.

The Saskatchewan Conservation House did not have a furnace. The cost of electricity to heat the house was estimated at $30–40 for a year.
An experimental solar heating system with a  array of vacuum-tube solar collectors collected heat from sunlight during the day, storing it in a  water tank insulated to about r-100. Pumps and heat exchangers could use the stored heat to heat the house at night or heat water. Solar gains during the winter were small, so the angle of the array was optimised.

Assessment
The Saskatchewan Conservation House was the most airtight house in the world at the time it was built. Its conservation measures, such as insulation, airtightness, and its ventilation system, were highly effective.

A blower door was used to obtain a standardized measurement of the number of times per hour that a fan could suck all of the air out of a house at a prescribed pressure of . At the time most new Canadian houses scored around 9 air changes per hour (ACH) at 50 Pa. On average, an existing Canadian home had  of air gaps, resulting in ratings of around 6.85 ach@50pa. In contrast, the Saskatchewan Conservation House achieved measures of 0.8 ach@50pa. Air remained fresh due to the inclusion of an air-to-air heat exchanger that used waste heat from vented air to warm fresh air as it was moved into the house.

Challenges
The Saskatchewan Conservation House project faced challenges, including the government-mandated inclusion of a solar hot-water system that proved to be expensive and inefficient. The solar component was new and experimental. It cost around $65,000 to build, more than the total cost for the rest of the house, which cost around $60,000. The prototype solar system was also extremely costly to maintain. Even though the electricity to power the system cost a few dollars a month, maintenance during its first year cost approximately $10,000.

Orr's takeaway from the project was that: 

Subsequent use
The Saskatchewan Conservation House was used for two years as a model show house. It was then sold to a private owner, who removed the solar component. Its building envelope continues to perform as designed, more than 40 years later.

Impact
The Saskatchewan Conservation House became a model for low-energy house design.

Its design approach of treating the ""house as a system"" became the basis of a voluntary national building standard. The standard included r-20 insulation, blower-door ratings of 1.5 ach@50pa or better, incorporation of a heat-recovery ventilator, and use of non-toxic materials. The new standard was supported by Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) and the Canadian Home Builders' Association (CHBA). At the time, it was the most stringent standard in the world. It was introduced decades before green building initiatives such as LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) and Built Green.

The elements used in the project paved the way for the development of the Natural Resources Canada R-2000 standard and its integration into the Canadian national building code. They led to the establishment of new national energy conservation protocols, the Energuide Energy efficiency building codes, for use in Canadian buildings. Fourteen similar houses were constructed in Saskatoon in the mid-1980s, using principles from the Saskatchewan Conservation House.

The Saskatchewan Conservation House also became a model for the international Passive House (Passivhaus) building energy efficiency standard. The Passivhaus standard was developed by Austrian physicist Wolfgang Feist and Swedish structural engineer Bo Adamson. After studying early superinsulated homes, including the Saskatchewan Conservation House, Feist stated a mathematical formula for the design of high-performance buildings, which was published in his thesis Passive Houses in Central Europe (1993).

Feist's standard has two hard limits: airtightness of a building must meet or exceed 0.6 ach@50pa, and its total energy use for heating and cooling must not exceed 15 kilowatt hours (kwh) per square metre of floor area. A building built to this standard can reduce energy consumption by 80 to 90 percent, compared to conventional construction. It is well enough insulated that it does not require an ""active"" furnace or boiler, hence the term ""passivhaus"". Buildings are certified to the passivhaus standard.

The first passivhaus to be built, in 1991, was the Darmstadt-Kranichstein Passive House, a row of four townhouses in Darmstadt, Germany. Since then, the passive house approach has become influential in Germany and other areas of Europe. In April 2015, Germany's Passive House Institute gave the designers of the Saskatchewan Conservation House a Pioneer Award for its design and construction.

Ironically, adoption of the approach has been slower in Canada than in Europe. Canada's first passive house was assembled in Whistler, B.C., using prefabricated components from Austria, for use at the 2010 Winter Olympics. The building used about one-tenth of the energy of a comparable-size conventional building, with a heating cost of $280 a year in 2011. In Saskatchewan, the first house to apply for official certification as a passive house was the Temperance Street Passive House, in 2016. It uses many of the principles that were introduced in the Saskatchewan Conservation House in 1977.",2024-02-07,"['Buildings and structures in Regina, Saskatchewan'

639,44942,76284328,8043,Safe Word (song),"""Safe Word"" is a song by American recording artist Brooke Candy, released as a digital-only single on February 22, 2024. It was released as the lead single from her sophomore studio album Candyland (2024) and her twenty-eighth single overall.

Background and release
In September 2022, Brooke Candy spoke to Paper about the release of her hyperpop-influenced single ""Flip Phone"", describing it as ""an exploration of pop music and a new sound for [Candy]"". It was her first new song since the release of her debut studio album Sexorcism (2019) and initially promoted as the lead single of her upcoming sophomore album, which was described as ""much more pop and digestible"" than much of her previous dirty rap outputs. Candy also released the collaborative song ""Yoga"" with Croatian musician Only Fire on October 14, 2022. In January 2023, Candy promoted the release of a new single ""Juicy Fruit"" in an interview with Only Fire for Interview Magazine, expressing indecisiveness about whether or not to release her new singles as part of a full project and later dubbing them a ""horny string of singles"" upon the release of a fourth new single entitled ""FMUATW"".

On February 19, 2024, Candy announced the release of a new single ""Safe Word"", clarifying that it was the ""official"" lead single of her upcoming album, which was in its final stages of production at the time of the song's release. The track had previously been teased on Candy's Instagram story two months prior and was officially released on February 22, 2024. It was produced by American musician Jordan Palmer and written by American songwriter JBach along with Candy herself. It also featured a new electro-pop sound for Candy, emphasized as the ""start of a new chapter for the artist"" in her interview with V, which described the lyrics of the song as ""thought-provoking and evocative"". Candy described the meaning of the song as ""giving in to your dark desires"" and ""living life on the edge to feel alive"". She also cited Britney Spears with her album Blackout (2007) as an inspiration for the sound and overall vibe of the song, naming it the ""dirtiest song on the album"" and detailing her journey to tone down her artistic persona for the new era.

Candy referred to the release of ""Safe Word"" as a ""triumphant return"", detailing her past dissatisfaction with her place in the music industry and feeling ""very overlooked"" throughout the previous two years in an interview with Office. She reiterated this in her interview with Hypebae, referring to an ""insane, almost vengeful demonic drive to go harder than [she has] ever gone"" with the release of her sophomore album.

Music video
The official music video for ""Safe Word"" was released on February 22, 2024, directed by Candy's husband Kyle England. Candy also dyed her hair orange to represent the new era, citing Madonna as an inspiration for both the stylistic change and the video itself. Candy also references the 1995 Hong Kong film Fallen Angels throughout the car scene of the music video, in which Candy reclines in the backseat of a convertible and rides down a busy highway, though this has also been likened to the visuals of The Doom Generation. The cinematography of the video was also inspired by that of Fallen Angels in an attempt to make the visuals ""feel like an acid trip"".

640,29264,75803077,9734,Al Siegel,"Al Siegel was a Canadian musician and businessman. He owned the Elmwood Casino, Windsor Raceway and the Blue Room in Toronto. Siegel was also the owner of a Canadian jukebox business.

 Career 

 Bee Palmer 
Siegel was a pianist for Bee Palmer during the 1920s. They were married on March 3, 1921, in Davenport, Iowa while Palmer was on a Vaudeville tour in the Midwest. The secret ceremony took place ""at a judge’s office in the local Masonic Temple."" Palmer was a singer and dancer who was sometimes credited as the creator of the shimmy dance.

 In October 1921, Siegel filed a $250,000 lawsuit against Jack Dempsey, the world heavyweight boxing champion from 1919 to 1926. Siegel claimed that Dempsey lured Palmer away from him while she was with Dempsey on the Orpheum Circuit. Dempsey denied the accusation. Palmer and Siegel separated for a time because of the controversy. They later made up in February 1922. The lawsuit was eventually dropped after their short separation. Siegel, with Palmer, performed at different venues around Chicago, including the Sherman House Hotel, Granada Theatre and Marbro Theatre. Palmer later divorced Siegel in 1928. He soon afterward got involved with Ethel Merman.  Siegel was ""her coach and accompanist."" The complicated and difficult romance of Siegel and Palmer was almost turned into a movie. Even though screenwriter Leo Katcher completed the script for the film, production efforts ceased for some reason.

Siegel was in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1927 as a performer. He was in the ensemble in Here’s Howe. He was also in the ensemble in Happy Go Lucky. Siegel was a part of at least three recordings in 1924. He played the piano during the making of those records.

 Ethel Merman 
One of Siegel’s major career accomplishments, as a musician, involved Ethel Merman and the role that she played in the George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin musical, Girl  Crazy, held at the Alvin Theatre in 1930-31. It was Merman’s debut Broadway performance. Her powerful voice and overwhelming presence on stage delighted the audience. Siegel helped her during her rehearsals for the production. He was also supposed to be the onstage pianist for the opening night performance, but became ill and was replaced by the pit pianist Roger Edens. Siegel got billing and credit for the production. He also did all of Merman’s vocal arrangements, including I Got Rhythm.

Siegel, Merman’s “shady pianist-manager,” helped her develop her unique style by helping her choose “better material” and by arranging it for her in an exciting way. Before Siegel came along, her amazing voice was the only thing that made her unique. Siegel later did claim that Merman became a star because of him, a claim that she denied. Ethel Merman performed at Al Siegel’s Elmwood Casino several years after they parted ways in the early 1930s. 

 Elmwood Casino 

 Siegel opened the Elmwood Casino in 1946. During its heyday, it was known as the “Showspot of Canada.” Danny Raskin stated in an article in The Detroit Jewish News that the Elmwood “was considered a major stomping ground for show biz greats. If you didn't play Al Siegel’s Elmwood Casino, you hadn't hit the big time yet.”

Siegel played sort of an encouraging role during the early days of Bob Newhart’s career. Newhart stated in the first chapter of his book, I Shouldn't Even Be Doing This!: And Other Things That Strike Me as Funny, that he “tanked onstage” during his one-week engagement at Siegel’s Elmwood Casino. At the end of the fifth performance, “when [Newhart] was feeling totally deflated,” Siegel approached him backstage. “He patted me on the back,” stated Newhart. Siegel then invited him to perform sometime at his Blue Room nightclub in Toronto. Newhart, stammering, thanked Siegel. In David Steinberg’s book, Inside Comedy, Newhart stated that poor performance at the Elmwood “‘almost drove me back to accounting.’”

The Elmwood  was opened for almost 30 years. Due to financial problems, Siegel voluntarily filed for bankruptcy and closed the nightclub in December 1974.

This was the last WNBA finals to use the best-of-five format as it will expand to a best-of-seven format in 2025.

Road to the Finals
Standings

Playoffs

In November 2021, the WNBA Board of Governors formalized a new playoff system that would structure the 2022 playoffs onward. The new playoff format scraps the single-elimination games of the first two rounds in favor of a best-of-3 quarterfinal round. As a result, all eight playoff teams, seeded according to overall regular season record regardless of conference (1 vs. 8, 2 vs. 7, 3 vs. 6, 4 vs. 5), will begin postseason play in the first round. Since 2016, seeds 3 and 4 received a bye to the second round (single game) and seeds 1 and 2 received a bye to the semifinals (best-of-5). In the first round series, the higher seeded team will host games 1 and 2, and the lower seeded team will host game 3 if necessary. In the semifinal round, no reseeding will take place, which means the winners of the 1 vs. 8 series will be paired with the winner of the 4 vs. 5 series as will the winners of the 2 vs. 7 and 3 vs. 6 series. The semifinal and final rounds will remain best-of-5 series in which the higher seeded team hosts games 1, 2 and (if necessary) 5 while the lower seeded team hosts games 3 and (if necessary) 4.

The New York Liberty qualified for the finals after finishing first in the regular season standings with a 32–8 regular season record. They defeated the Atlanta Dream 2–0 in the first round and the Las Vegas Aces 3–1 in the Semifinals. This was the Liberty's second appearance in the finals since 2002, and sixth overall.

The Minnesota Lynx qualified for the finals after finishing second in the regular season standings with a 30–10 regular season record. They defeated the Phoenix Mercury 2–0 in the first round and the Connecticut Sun 3–2 in the Semifinals. This was the Lynx seventh overall appearance in the finals, which is the most all time.

 Summary 

The Liberty and the Lynx faced-off in the finals as the first and second overall seeds. This is the second year in a row where the top two seeds qualified for the finals. The Lynx won the regular season series between the two teams two games to one, and defeated New York in the 2024 WNBA Commissioner's Cup. The Liberty entered the series with two extra days of rest as they wrapped their Semifinal series on October 6, while the Lynx had to play a Game Five on October 8.

Game 1

The Finals started in New York with the Liberty dominating the first quarter, winning 32–19. Minnesota trailed by as many as eighteen-points in the second quarter, but won the quarter 17–12. The Liberty took an eight-point lead into halftime. The Lynx cut the lead to seven after winning a close third quarter 25–24. The Lynx turned it up in the fourth quarter, winning 23–16 in order to force overtime. Courtney Williams had a four point play with 5.5 seconds left to put the Lynx up by one, but Breanna Stewart could only make one of two free throws with the final play of regulation. This was the first game since game two of the 2021 Finals to go into overtime. In a close frame, the Lynx stole an away win by winning overtime 11–9. The Lynx were the first team in playoff history to be down 15+ points in the final five minutes and come back to win the game.

The Lynx were led by Courtney Williams, who scored twenty-three points, and they had four players score in double figures. Kayla McBride scored twenty-two points, Napheesa Collier scored twenty-one points, and Natisha Hiedeman scored ten points, in just thirteen minutes of playing time. The Liberty also had four players score in double figures, and were led by Jonquel Jones who scored twenty-four points. Sabrina Ionescu scored nineteen points, Breanna Stewart scored eighteen points, and Leonie Fiebich scored seventeen points. Jones recorded ten rebounds to have the first double-double of the finals. Other stats revealed how close the game was with the Lynx winning points in the paint 42–36, bench points 15–10, and the turnover battle 12–15. However, the Liberty were ahead in fast break points 19–17 and rebounds 44–32.

Game 2

Game two in New York began with the Liberty coming out strong and going on a 12–0 run. They would end up winning the first quarter 31–21. The Lynx came back in the second quarter and it finished even at 18–18. The Liberty lead by as many as seventeen in the first half, and took a ten-point lead into halftime. The third quarter was low-scoring and the Lynx prevailed 14–12 to cut the Liberty's lead to eight heading into the final frame. The Lynx cut the lead to three points during the fourth quarter, but ultimately the Liberty pulled away and won the fourth quarter 19–13 and took the game by fourteen points. The Liberty evened the series at one game a piece in front of the largest crowd to ever attend a Liberty game at the Barclays Center, with 18,046 fans.

The Liberty had four players score in double figures and were led by Breanna Stewart who scored twenty-one points.

Game 3

The series moved to Minnesota for game three and the Lynx took advantage of having the home court, winning the first quarter 28–18. The Liberty's defense improved in the second quarter, and they limited the Lynx to fifteen points in the quarter, and the Liberty scored seventeen to win the quarter. The Lynx lead by as many as fifteen in the first half and took an eight-point lead into halftime. The Liberty stormed out of the halftime break and won the third quarter 26–19 to cut the lead to one-point. The game continued to be back and forth during the fourth quarter and Sabrina Ionescu hit a three-point shot with one second remaining to secure the quarter and the game for the Liberty. The Liberty won the fourth quarter 19–15 and game three by three points. The Liberty drew within one game of winning their first WNBA title in front of a record crowd of 19,521 at the Target Center.

The Liberty had four players score in double figures, and were led by Breanna Stewart who scored thirty points. Leonie Fiebich, Sabrina Ionescu, and Jonquel Jones all scored thirteen points.

Game three saw the points in the paint tied at twenty eight, the Lynx led in fast break points 11–5, the Liberty won bench points 9–8 and the Lynx won the turnover battle 10–16. The rebounding battle was much closer as well, with the Liberty winning 33–32.

Game 4 

Game four began with the Lynx facing elimination at home. The first quarter was a very back and forth affair and the quarter ended tied at 23. The second quarter did little to separate the teams and the Lynx won the quarter 23–22 to take just a one-point lead into halftime. The third quarter was a lower scoring affair, but did nothing to separate the teams, as it ended tied at 18. Defense continued to dominate a tight fourth quarter, and the Lynx prevailed in the quarter 18–17. The Lynx won game four by two points and forced a game five in New York. Defense was key for the Lynx as they held the Liberty stars Breanna Stewart and Sabrina Ionescu to a combined 10–36 shooting. The two were also 0–9 on three point attempts. Bridget Carleton was fouled with two seconds remaining, and made both shots. The Liberty had possession to end the game, but Ionescu was unable to make another game-winning shot.

The Lynx had all five starters score in double figures, and were led by Kayla McBride who scored nineteen points. Courtney Williams scored fifteen points, Napheesa Collier scored fourteen points, and both Bridget Carleton and Alanna Smith contributed twelve points. All five Liberty starters also scored in double figures and they were led by Jonquel Jones who scored twenty-one points. Rookie Leonie Fiebich scored nineteen points, Breanna Stewart scored eleven points, and both Sabrina Ionescu and Betnijah Laney-Hamilton scored ten points. Stewart recorded eleven rebounds for her second double-double of the finals. The Liberty again won the rebounding battle 40–31, they also won fast break points 12–11, and points in the paint 38–26. The Lynx won the turnover battle 12–15, bench points 10–9, and scored more points off turnovers 19–10.

Game 5

The deciding game five in New York began with the Lynx dominating the first quarter, winning 19–10. New York clawed back in the second quarter and won the quarter 17–15. The generally low-scoring half saw the Lynx take a seven-point lead into halftime. The Liberty recovered after the break and won the third quarter 20–10 to take a three-point lead into the final frame. However, the Lynx would not give up and won the fourth quarter 16–13, leaving the game tied at sixty. The Lynx led by as many as twelve points in the first half, and led in the final minute of regulation but could not hold off the Liberty. Liberty stars Breanna Stewart and Sabrina Ionescu again struggled, going a combined 5–34 from the field. The Liberty won the overtime period 7–2, during which Collier fouled out. The Liberty led the league in three pointers during the regular season, but only managed to make two in game 5, one by Ionescu in the fourth quarter, and one by Fiebich to start overtime. The Liberty won game five by five points to claim their first WNBA title in their sixth finals appearance, which also marked the first championship for a professional basketball team in the New York area since the New York Nets won their second championship in the ABA in 1976.

The Liberty had four players score in double figures and were led by Finals MVP Jonquel Jones who scored seventeen points. Leonie Fiebich, Nyara Sabally, and Breanna Stewart all added thirteen points. Stewart also had fifteen rebounds to record her third double-double of the Finals. The Lynx only had two players score in double figures and were led by Napheesa Collier, who scored twenty-two points. Kayla McBride scored twenty-one points. The Liberty led in points in the paint, 44–38. They won fast break points 4–2, bench points 15–6, and won the turnover battle 12–16. Just as in very other game in the finals, the Liberty won the rebounding battle 44–33. The Liberty got a major boost in game five from their bench, as Nyara Sabally played seventeen minutes, a playoff high. She and Kayla Thornton contributed defensively as well.

The game's officiating came under heavy scrutiny, particularly the amount of free throw attempts the Liberty got compared to the Lynx and the foul call on Lynx center Alanna Smith with 5.2 seconds left in regulation, which led to Breanna Stewart making two free throw attempts that led the game into overtime. In the post-game's news conference, Reeve claims the game was stolen from them and called for a third party that should be included in challenges going forward. Several prominent sports media figures as well as NBA and WNBA players such as LeBron James, Damian Lillard, Isaiah Thomas, Shakira Austin, and Rex Chapman all criticized the way the referees handled the game, with some pointing out on Smith's foul call that she had minimal contact and that Stewart traveled the ball up to her. Sabreena Merchant for The Athletic wrote the officiating will ""leave a stain on what was otherwise an incredible series"".

The National Society for Women's Suffrage was the first national group in the United Kingdom to campaign for women's right to vote. Formed on 6 November 1867, by Lydia Becker, the organisation helped lay the foundations of the women's suffrage movement.

Eliza Wigham, Jane Wigham, Priscilla Bright McLaren and some of their friends set up an Edinburgh chapter of this National Society. Eliza and her friend Agnes McLaren became the secretaries.National Society for Women's Suffrage. Examiner; 14 January 1871; 3285; British Periodicals pg 55 By 1870, branches in Scotland were in Aberdeen, Glasgow, St. Andrews and Galloway.

Jacob Bright, a Liberal politician, supported by a petition from Jane Taylour  of the Galloway branch and others, had suggested in 1871 that it would be useful to create a London-based organisation to lobby members of parliament concerning women's suffrage. The Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage first met on 17 January 1872.

The national society was furthered later by the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies and the Women's Social and Political Union.

652,50612,367838,12261,Biddulph,"Biddulph is a town in Staffordshire, England,  north of Stoke-on-Trent and  south-east of Congleton, Cheshire.

Origin of the name
Biddulph's name may come from Anglo-Saxon/Old English bī dylfe = ""beside the pit or quarry"". It may also stem from a corruption of the Saxon/Old English Bidulfe, meaning ""wolf slayer"", and the Biddulph family crest is a wolf rampant.

In the days of coal and iron, Biddulph was called Bradley Green, with the original site of Biddulph being the area in which the parish church, Grange House and the ruins of Biddulph Old Hall stand. It was not until 1930 that the town was marked on Ordnance Survey maps as Biddulph.

Geography

Biddulph is in a valley between the ridges of Mow Cop to the west and Biddulph Moor to the east. It encompasses the hamlets of Gillow Heath, Knypersley and Brown Lees.

Education

In common with other parts of the area administered by Staffordshire LEA, the Middle School system operates in Biddulph.

Biddulph has one high school (ages 13 to 16) with a sixth form (ages 16 to 18) called Biddulph High School, it was awarded Sports College status in 2002.  It has since gained Technology College status.  Biddulph also has two middle schools: Woodhouse Middle School (formerly Biddulph Grammar School), and James Bateman Middle School (formerly Park Middle School), serving pupils aged 9–13.  These are fed by several first schools, such as Kingsfield First School, Knypersley First School, Squirrel Hayes First School, Oxhey First School, and several more.

Local media
Television
Since the town is close to the Cheshire-Staffordshire border, local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada that broadcast from Salford. However, the town can receive BBC West Midlands and ITV Central through satellite television such as Freesat and Sky.

Radio

The town is home to Churnet Sound radio a community radio station that broadcasts in DAB across south Cheshire and North Staffordshire. 
Other local radio stations are BBC Radio Stoke, Hits Radio Staffordshire & Cheshire, Greatest Hits Radio Staffordshire & Cheshire and Moorlands Radio.

Newspapers
The Sentinel is the local daily newspaper. There is also the Biddulph Chronicle, a weekly newspaper, which is a sister publication to the Congleton Chronicle.

Main sights

Within the valley created by the ridges of Mow Cop and Biddulph Moor, the main sights of note include; ancient burial mounds; evidence of the English Civil War; the bubonic plague; the site of the former Black Bull Colliery; tombs of possible Crusader knights; an Iron Age fort; and the site of a meeting of the Methodist movement with the Wesleys.

A dominant feature on hills above the village is Mow Cop Castle, which is a folly built in the 1750s to look like a medieval fortress and round tower.

Biddulph is also home to Biddulph Grange, a house and landscaped gardens owned by the National Trust. Adjacent to and part of the original estate is Biddulph Grange Country Park.

Biddulph Town Hall was completed in 1965.

Transport
Biddulph railway station was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway in 1864. The station was on the Biddulph Valley Line that ran from a junction just north of Congleton on the Stoke-on-Trent – Macclesfield line to a junction south of Stoke-on-Trent station. Passenger traffic was withdrawn from the station on 11 July 1927, but freight traffic continued until 5 October 1964. There was also a canal rail interchange at Congleton Junction. The remains of the small dock on the Macclesfield Canal can still be seen. Parts of the station platform can still be seen, and one of the original buildings is now a private residence, the trackbed now forms the Biddulph Valley Way.

The nearest active stations are now in Congleton or Kidsgrove, which provide connections to Birmingham, Crewe, Derby, London Euston, Macclesfield, Manchester, Stafford and Stoke-on-Trent. 

Biddulph is located on the A527, which links it to Congleton in the North and Stoke-on-Trent in the south.

654,40077,76138093,8400,Altercatio Ecclesiae et Synagogae,"The Altercatio Ecclesiae et Synagogae is an anonymous Latin dialogue between Ecclesia and Synagoga, personifications of the Church (Christianity) and the Synagogue (Judaism). It was written  in the fifth century, probably in Roman Africa. Throughout the Middle Ages, it was falsely attributed to Augustine.

The fictional dialogue has a courtroom setting. It is a Christian apologia and a polemic against Judaism.

Date, authorship and sources
The Altercatio was probably written after 438, when Jews were forbidden by law from holding public office in the Roman Empire. By reference to Christian emperors, it may be argued that the text was written before the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476. This is not certain, but the text was probably written in the fifth century. The oldest known copy is from the ninth century. The text may have been known in Spain by 673. According to Jocelyn Hillgarth, Julian of Toledo used its criticism of Judaism as a model for his criticism of Gaul when writing the Insultatio in tyrannidem Galliae in the aftermath of the revolt of Paulus.. This hypothesis is rejected by .

The Altercatio was probably written in Roman Africa, as judged by its author's use of Cyprian of Carthage's Testimonia and by the use of the title Basileion for the Books of Kings, a title favourd by African authors. Biblical quotations, drawn from Cyprian, correspond to the Vetus Latina. The supersessionist theology of the Altercatio is drawn mainly from Cyprian. His view of ""the providential role of the Roman Empire in the Christianization of the world"" is taken from Ambrose of Milan.  A source unique to him is Roman law. Desiderius Erasmus first noted that the author was familiar with the law. He may have been a lawyer.

Synopsis
The Altercatio begins with a first-person introduction establishing a courtroom setting where two ladies will dispute the rightful inheritance of God's promises in the Old Testament. The rest of the work consists of the back and forth comments of the litigants, the Church (Ecclesia) and the Synagogue (Synagoga).

First, Synagoga argues that the prophets were sent to her, but Ecclesia responds that she killed them. Synagoga then argues that she is the more ancient, but Ecclesia responds that there has been a reversal of roles and the elder now serves the younger, as Esau served Jacob. This leads to a debate about the status of Jews in the Empire, with Synagoga defending her freedom and Ecclesia point to her loss of full civil rights.

Synagoga argues that even Jesus was sent to the Jews, but Ecclesia retorts that the Jews are all the more culpable for having rejected him. She does not levy the standard accusation of Jewish deicide. The text then turns to the question of circumcision versus the sign of the cross with reference to the Prophets. At the end, Synagoga admits that she did not heed the Prophets and misinterpreted them.

Language and genre
Dorothea Weber describes the Latin of the Altercatio as ""bombastic-stilted"". At times it is even incomprehensible. It contains a single hapax legomenon in pompatilis at line 64. Certain phrases are also found in the writings of Petrus Chrysologus, Cassiodorus and Ruricius. The highly rhetorical style belongs to the fifth and sixth centuries.

The Altercatios dialogue form was inspired by the contemporary Dialogue of Simon and Theophilus of . It differs from the Dialogue in giving a situation for the debate (a court of law). The anonymous Consultationes Zacchei christiani et Apollonii philosophi also has a first-person introduction, but like the Dialogue it lacks situational context. A context is given in Jerome's Altercatio Luciferiani et orthodoxi and a courtroom setting specifically in the pseudo-Augustinian Collatio Augustini cum Pascentio. The courtroom setting may reflect actual debates that took place between the Nicene Orthodox and Arians in the Vandal Kingdom in Africa in the fifth century, as recorded in the Collatio Augustini cum Maximino.

The most unique aspect of the Altercatio Eclesiae et Synagogae is its use of personifications rather than fictitious or fictionalized persons. The nearest text in terms of genre—a ""polemical dialogue between"" the personifications Church and Synagogue—is the anonymous tenth-century Altercatio Aecclesiae contra Synagogam, possibly written in England and potentially influenced by the Altercatio Ecclesiae et Synagogae.

Manuscripts and editions
The Altercatio appears to have travelled from North Africa to Spain, then across the Pyrenees to Gaul and finally across the Alps into Italy. There are at least twelve surviving manuscripts and three lost ones. The ninth, eleventh and twelfth centuries have three manuscripts each. The latest manuscripts are from the fifteenth century. The earliest known manuscript, now lost, was catalogued at the Abbey of Reichenau in 835–842. The earliest surviving copy is found in Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, CLM 15819, copied in Salzburg during the archiepiscopate of Liupram (836–859). This is slightly older than the copy found in Saint Gall, Stiftsbibliothek 132, copied during the abbacy of Grimald (850–872). All the surviving manuscripts belong to a single family (descended from a single hyparchetype of about the eighth century), with the exception of manuscript 247 from Monte Cassino, copied in Beneventan script in the twelfth century. The former manuscript family attributes it to Augustine of Hippo.

Prior to 1955, the Altercatio was printed many times, always printed with Augustine's works. The editio princeps was printed by Bonifacius Amerbach in Basel in 1506 as part of Augustine's works. It was reprinted with minor changes by Erasmus in 1528. He already recognized that it was not by Augustine. Today, it is universally regarded as pseudo-Augustinian. A critical edition based on all known manuscripts was published by Jocelyn Hillgarth in 1999. The Altercatio is usually cited by Hillgarth's line numbers.As in  and . A full English translation of Hillgarth's edition was made by Michael Brinks in 2009.",2025-04-14,['5th-century books in Latin' '5th-century Christian texts'],"['Latin' 'Ecclesia and Synagoga' 'Christianity' 'Judaism' 'Roman Africa'

655,45850,5377564,4388,Sport (botany),"In botany, a sport or bud sport, traditionally called lusus, is a part of a plant that shows morphological differences from the rest of the plant. Sports may differ by foliage shape or color, flowers, fruit, or branch structure. The cause is generally thought to be chance genetic mutations in a single cell. Sports may also arise from stable changes in gene expression due to epigenetic modifications, including histone modification, DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling and RNA silencing.DOI 10.1038/s41438-018-0062-x If the clonal descendants of a modified cell eventually form a meristem that gives rise to new plant parts, those may be of a new phenotype. Often only part of the meristem cells are affected, resulting in genetic chimerism in such sports.

Horticulture
Sports with desirable characteristics may be grown into new plants by vegetative reproduction and are often propagated as new cultivars that retain the characteristics of the new morphology. Such selections are often prone to ""reversion"", meaning that part or all of the plant reverts to its original form. An example of a bud sport is the nectarine, at least some of which developed as a bud sport from peaches.Charles Darwin, 1868: Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication Other common fruits resulting from a sport mutation are the red Anjou pear, the Ruby Red grapefruit, and the variegated pink lemon, which is a sport of the ""Eureka"" lemon.

The use of spontaneous mutations in plant breeding may avoid certain challenges associated with breeding by sexual recombination, like heterozygosity and sexual incompatibilities. Since usually only (very) few alleles are affected, most of the traits of the original cultivar are retained.DOI 10.1016/j.scienta.2022.110979",2025-02-07,['Plant morphology' 'Mutation' 'Horticulture'],"['botany' 'flowers' 'branch' 'genetic mutation' 'epigenetic'

 Biography 
She began doing rhythmic gymnastics at the age of 7 at the Vallisoletano Club in Valladolid. She remained there until 1991, having as main coaches Teresa de Isla, Sonia Conde, Marga de Isla and Virginia Manzanera. In 1989 she won a gold medal at the Spanish Group Championships held in Torrelavega, in 1990 the silver medal at the Spanish Individual Championships in Palencia, and 7th place in senior category in the Spanish Championships held in Torrevieja in 1991. At the end of the competition of the Spanish Group Championships in December 1990, her coach told her that she had been selected to go to a selection camp with the national team in Madrid.

In 1991 she became part of the national senior group, training about 8 hours a day at the Moscardó Gymnasium in Madrid under the direction of Emilia Boneva and Ana Roncero, who since 1982 had been national group coach and head coach. In 1993 her coach became María Fernández Ostolaza. Although from the summer of 1991 she was already part of the group, she was not called up to the competitions until the following year.

In 1992 they won silver in a tournament in Karlsruhe, and later they were invited to give an exhibition at one in Corbeil-Essonnes. In June, with new exercises, she was a substitute at the European Championships in Stuttgart, where Spain shared the gold medal in the All-Around with the Russian team, in addition to winning another gold in the 3 balls and 3 ropes final and bronze in 6 ribbons. Alicia did not compete in the 1992 Olympic Games because rhythmic gymnastics was an individual-only sport at the Olympics at that time, although she participated with the rest of her teammates in the opening ceremony, leading the parade of participating nations.

Shortly after, they won gold at both the Asvo Cup in Austria and the Alfred Vogel Cup in the Netherlands, where they also won silver in 6 ribbons and gold in 3 balls and 3 ropes. Fuster and Gómez were injured before the World Championships in Brussels, which took place in November 1992. They were kept on the team as substitutes, but in the competing lineup were replaced by Alicia, Cristina Martínez and Bárbara Plaza. In this competition, the team won silver in the All-Around, with their score just one tenth of a point away from allowing them to retain the world title they had won the previous year. In addition, on November 22 they won bronze in the 6 ribbons final and were 8th with 3 balls and 3 ropes.

In 1993, Ana Roncero became national head coach and María Fernández Ostolaza joined as coach of the group. After many of the previous group members retired Alicia, Carolina Borrell, Cristina Martínez, Maider Olleta, Bárbara Plaza and Pilar Rodrigo, with María Álvarez, Regina Guati, Lorena Barbadillo, Paula Cabo and Eva Velasco as substitutes, constituted the new national group. At the European Championships in Bucharest, the Spanish group won the bronze medal in the All-Around and with 4 hoops & 4 clubs, taking 6th place with 6 ropes. In September 1993 they competed at the Gymnastic Masters in Stuttgart, where they were 4th in both the All-Around and in the final of 4 hoops & 4 clubs, winning bronze with 6ropes. In the Group Masters of Alicante were silver in the All-Around and gold in the two apparatus finals. In Alicante the group was already made up of Alicia, María Álvarez, Lorena Barbadillo, Paula Cobo, Regina Guati, Cristina Martínez, Maider Olleta and Eva Velasco. At the Wacoal Cup in Tokyo they won the bronze medal.

She retired in November 1993, following the Wacoal Cup. She took the course to be a licensed national rhythmic gymnastics' coach, working as a school-level coach. Alicia graduated in speech therapy from the University of Valladolid, and in psychology from the National University of Distance Education. After working several years as a speech therapist she specialized in clinical psychology at the University Hospital of Burgos. Alicia currently works as a clinical psychologist in a public hospital in Castilla y León.

After Boneva's death on 20 September 2019, Alicia and other former national gymnasts gathered to pay tribute to her during the Euskalgym held on 16 November 2019. The event took place before 8,500 attendees at the Bilbao Exhibition Center de Baracaldo and was followed by a dinner in Boneva's honor.",2025-03-01,"['1975 births' 'Living people' 'Spanish rhythmic gymnasts'

658,34775,75981513,23496,Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam," 

Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (;  TVK) is an Indian regional political party in the state of Tamil Nadu and the union territory of Puducherry. It was founded by actor-turned-politician Vijay on 2 February 2024. The party is led by its founder Vijay as the president of the party from its date of founding. The headquarters of the party is located at Seashore Town, 8th Avenue, Panaiyur, Chennai.

History
On 26 June 2009, Vijay launched his fan club, Vijay Makkal Iyakkam (), in Pudukkottai to carry out philanthropic activities. The organization supported the AIADMK-led Alliance in the 2011 legislative assembly elections. The fan club organization contested the local body elections in Tamil Nadu in October 2021, securing victory in 115 out of the 169 seats they contested. Vijay called the Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 2019 as ""unacceptable"" as it would disrupt the social and religious harmony of the nation. 

 2024–present 
On 2 February 2024, Vijay announced the launch of his political party, Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam, and stated its intent to enter the 2026 elections. N.Anand is currently serving as the general secretary of Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam. In July, 2024, Vijay called for ban on National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), as its biased against rural students and urged the departments of education and sanitation to be moved back to the state list from the concurrent list.

In 4 September, 2024, It was reported TVK will adopt left-wing leaning political ideologies, including Ambedkarism, Marxism, and Periyarism, and will not align with right-wing positions or ideologies. The party will be opposing the current status quo ruling parties, DMK in Tamil Nadu and BJP in centre. It was announced that the party's ideology will be revealed in detail at TVK's first political conference, TVK Maanadu, on October 27, 2024.

On 27 October, 2024, TVK held its first conference in Vikravandi, which was attended by 800,000 to 1,200,000 people. Cutouts of social justice leaders and freedom fighters like Periyar, Ambedkar, Kamaraj, Anjalai Ammal and Velu Nachiyar were erected and announced that they will be TVK's ideological guiding leaders . Vijay revealed his party's ideology as 'Secular Social Justice ideologies' and stated that TVK reflects a left-leaning Dravidian stance in most aspects. He stated that the party would uphold policies such as the two-language policy, social justice, equality, secularism, socialism, egalitarianism, and democracy.  While Vijay did not directly name the BJP and DMK, but it is reported that his comments were aimed at them. He emphasized that the TVK considers any party promoting a divisive agenda, targeting BJP as its ideological opponent, while viewing the ruling DMK as its primary political adversary due to allegations of corruption and the promotion of dynasty politics in name of Dravidian model. On November 3, 2024, TVK passed 26 resolutions against BJP and DMK's rule and policies. Since the conference with massive youth presence, TVK's rise has pushed the established parties, including DMK and AIADMK, to increase their efforts to retain the youth vote ahead of the 2026 Tamil Nadu elections.

659,12047,75318446,26436,Robert E. Cavanaugh Hall,"Robert E. Cavanaugh Hall was one of the first non-medical academic buildings constructed on the IUPUI campus alongside Joseph T. Taylor Hall, known as the Blake Street Library at that time, and the Lecture Hall. Cavanaugh Hall served as an early hub for academic, administrative, and student activities which would lead to a constantly reshuffling of space usage. Competition of space for classrooms, administrative activities, and student activities would underscore the history of Cavanaugh Hall. Cavanaugh Hall currently serves as the home for the IUPUI School of Liberal Arts and various related research units.

Cavanaugh Hall is home to the Ray Bradbury Center, which holds some of Bradbury's archives and exhibits his full home office. 

 History 
Cavanaugh Hall was completed in 1971 and located on Agnes Street, later known as 925 W. Michigan Street, and designed by Reid, Thompson & Boots Associates, Inc. Cavanaugh Hall was named after Robert E. Cavanaugh, former dean of the IU Extension Campus. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on September 4, 1968. Cavanaugh Hall consisted of 69 classrooms, 15 laboratories, 150 offices, a faculty lounge on the fifth floor, and the campus bookstore located in the basement.IU School of Liberal Arts in Indianapolis, “Celebrating 50 Years of Liberal Arts,” July 29, 2021. The dedication was accompanied by a protest by the Black Student Union for better educational and health programs for inner-city communities. The student union emphasized that they were not opposed to the dedication of Cavanaugh Hall and just wanted to bring greater attention to community issues.

Cavanaugh Hall served as an academic hub for students, especially non-medical students with various facilities housed in the building. Some of these facilities included the Campus Centre Theatre Box Office which allowed students to purchase tickets to performances hosted by fellow students in IndianapolisThe Sagamore. October 19, 1971. https://archives.iupui.edu/handle/2450/10015 and the campus housekeeping services located in the basement.

Following its completion, many academic departments moved to the new building with the School of Liberal Arts making up the majority of the units. The IU Speech Department moved from the Marott Building, now known as the Turnverein Apartment Complex, to Cavanaugh Hall.IUPUI. Department of Communications Program Review, February 1997. Indianapolis, IN: IUPUI, 1992: 45. Communication Department Files, Box 1, Folder 35, Ruth Lilly Special Collections & Archives, Indianapolis. In 1972, the restructuring of undergraduate programs led to the creation of the School of Liberal Arts (humanities and social sciences).Indiana University School of Liberal Arts Mission and History, 1981, Sociology Department Files, Box 2, Folder 12, Ruth Lilly Special Collections & Archives, Indianapolis. The IUPUI (Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis) School of Social Work, previously known as the School of Social Service, moved to Cavanaugh Hall sometime between 1971 and 1973.  The IUPUI Economics Department opened the new Economic Statistics Laboratory on the fourth floor of Cavanaugh in September of 1972.“Econ. Lab Now Open.” The Sagamore. September 25, 1972. https://archives.iupui.edu/handle/2450/10016

In the 1970s, IUPUI began moving programs that were essential to student activity to Cavanaugh Hall. This included the Admissions Office, Registrar Office, Bursar Office, and Financial Aid Office which all took up residence on the first floor of Cavanaugh.Gray, Ralph D. IUPUI--The Making of an Urban University. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2003: 200-202. This led to a decrease in the total number of classrooms able to be used in Cavanaugh due to the need for administrative space. A student lounge was set up on the lower floor with vending machines, television sets, and places to socialize for students to relax while on campus. The campus bookstore was also set up on the lower floor of Cavanaugh where students could get all their textbooks for classes.  The Arts and Sciences Office was established on the fourth floor of the building to handle credit requirements for science and liberal arts programs. The Office for Scholarships and Financial Aid and the Student Services office were established on the third floor to assist students in their academic activities. The Student Senate Office on the second floor was established in the new building to create a space for IUPUI student senate members to hold meetings. In 1971, Sherry Bennett established a new campuswide paper named the IUPUI Sagamore in an office space on 38th Street.Gray, pp. 205-206. Eventually, the office was relocated to the second floor of Cavanaugh Hall, then to the basement area.“The Saga of the Sagamore.” The Sagamore. October 5, 1971. https://archives.iupui.edu/handle/2450/10015 The Student Senate established a bulletin board in the Cavanaugh Lobby to inform students of upcoming activities, furthering solidifying the building as a hub for student activity.“Senate Approve Bulletin Board.” The Sagamore. December 7, 1971. https://archives.iupui.edu/handle/2450/10015

In 1973, the School of Science and Liberal Arts programs were reorganized into separate entities which led to the dissolution of the Arts and Science Office. The School of Liberal Arts Office was established in its place, while the School of Science Office moved from Cavanaugh to the Administration Building.“File Move to 38th St. Completes Restructure.” The Sagamore. February 12, 1973. https://archives.iupui.edu/handle/2450/10047 The Student Association moved from the second floor to the basement to make room for more classrooms. In the Summer of 1977, the University Division moved to the Engineering and Technology Building to create more space for the Financial Aid Office due to growing enrollment.“University Division Moves Offices to E/T Building.” The Sagamore. June 8, 1977. https://archives.iupui.edu/handle/2450/10127

Space issues would persist throughout the 1970s, but the leasing of the Mary E. Cable Building would alleviate the need for more classroom space for the School of Liberal Arts for the next couple decades. In November of 1980, the IU Board of Trustees approved a proposal to lease the Mary E. Cable Elementary School. The Department of Communications and Theatre would move from Cavanaugh Hall to the elementary school.“IUPUI to Lease Old School 4.” Indianapolis Recorder, November 22, 1980. Despite this new space, Cavanaugh would continue welcoming new administrative and academic units throughout the 1980s.

In 1981, the School of Journalism opened spaces on the Indianapolis campus in Cavanaugh Hall on the third floor.“Journalism School Expanded to IUPUI Campus.” The Sagamore. August 26, 1981. https://archives.iupui.edu/handle/2450/10219 These spaces consisted of four classrooms and two offices. In January 1982, the School of Social Worked moved from Cavanaugh Hall to the Education building.

August 24, 1983. https://archives.iupui.edu/handle/2450/10246 The goal was to students to conduct all their administrative needs without needing to travel across campus.

The mid-1980s saw a plethora of new administrative and research units begin to occupy Cavanaugh Hall. The Institute for Humanities Research opened on the fifth floor of Cavanaugh Hall in August 1984. In 1984, Cavanaugh Hall houses the Center for American Studies, Peirce Edition Project, Journal of the Early Republic, and Center for Economic Development.“Etcetera from Liberal Arts.” February 1984, Sociology Department Files, Box 3, Folder 23, Ruth Lilly Special Collections & Archives, Indianapolis. The Center for American Studies and Journal of the Early Republic shared an office space on the fifth floor of Cavanaugh. The Center for American Studies occupied the former office of the dean of social work, whereas the Journal of the Early Republic occupied the assistant dean’s office.Gray, p. 165. Brian S. Vargus, Sociology professor, successfully proposed the creation of the Public Opinion Laboratory in the School of Liberal Arts.""Plan for a Public Opinion Laboratory.” Sociology Department Files, Box 2, Folder 8, Ruth Lilly Special Collections & Archives, Indianapolis. The goal of the laboratory was to develop internship opportunities for students interested in public opinion research as well as gather community data to be used professional development opportunities. At the end of 1984, the fourth floor of Cavanaugh was renovated to create more space for the School of Liberal Arts.“Liberal Arts Expanding.” The Sagamore. November 26, 1984. https://archives.iupui.edu/handle/2450/10255  In October 1985, the School of Liberal Arts announced the formation of the Office of Student Affairs located on the fourth floor to provide academic services for liberal art majors.“Trustee Approve Projects, OK Adult Education Center.” The Sagamore. September 15, 1986. https://archives.iupui.edu/handle/2450/10257. In 1986, the Black Student Union vacated their office in the basement of Cavanaugh and moved to the basement of the Blake Street Library. The new space was renovated for the Adult Education Center, which was created to support continuing education programs. In 1987, the Office of Women’s Research and Resources was established in Cavanaugh Hall.IUPUI Office for Women, “Creating Gender Equality at IUPUI: Fifty Years of Leadership.” The office is now currently housed in the University Library.

The construction of new buildings in the late 1980s and early 1990s on campus would allow some academic units to transfer to new locations, while those that remained shuffled into new spaces. In 1991, the Department of Geology and Biology moved from the third floor to the new Science Building. The third floor became the new home for the Departments of Anthropology, Religious Studies, and Sociology.IUPUI. Institutional Self-Study Narrative, 1992. Indianapolis, IN: IUPUI, 1992: 179 Sue Steinmetz, Head of the Sociology Department, moved the Sociology Department to the third floor of Cavanaugh.“Department of Sociology Self-Study Report.” Sociology Department Files, Box 3, Folder 16, Ruth Lilly Special Collections & Archives, Indianapolis. This included establishing the Family Research Project and the Sussman Research Library on the third floor. The Sussman Research Library was established through a contribution of the books, journals, and papers of Marvin B. Sussman. The library contains a large collection of materials on family science and sociology, with an emphasis on population, aging, family violence, sexuality, health, law, history, race/ethnicity, and deviance.

Without a dedicated campus center, Cavanaugh Hall served as one of the focal points of student activity but was constantly plagued with competition for classroom and office space. In 1996, the Student Canteen located in the basement of Cavanaugh was cut in half to create room for a new enrollment center.Aaron, Dan. “Space Split Envokes Debate.” The Sagamore. August 26, 1996. https://archives.iupui.edu/handle/2450/10787 This project created student outrage over the loss of student-dedicated space amid controversies surrounding a dedicated student center. Students expressed how the university has continued to eliminate existing student activity spaces without creating a Student Center. Administration defended its actions by stating that the university is in dire need of a new and improved enrollment center to improve student retention. Later that year, the third floor was renovated to centralize the communication studies program into a single building. Communication faculty members vacated the University Library and Mary E. Cable Building to consolidate the program space in Cavanaugh.Litten, Matt. “Faculty, Students Looking up with Move to Cavanaugh Hall.” The Sagamore. August 19, 1996. https://archives.iupui.edu/handle/2450/10787

After the new IUPUI Campus Center was completed in 2008, the Cavanaugh Hall bookstore was closed and moved to its new location in the basement of the Campus Center. In 2012, the former campus bookstore space was renovated by Rosk Group to convert the space into classrooms and student social spaces. The space had served as an informal gathering place for students in Cavanaugh, but the space continued to be underutilized until the renovation.“Cavanaugh Hall Classroom 008 Renovation.” Capital Planning & Facilities, 2012.

 Former Research Centers 

 Confucius Institute 
IUPUI was selected in 2007 to house a Confucius Institute with Professor “Joe” Xu, professor of neuroscience at the IU School of Medicine, as its first director. The Confucius Institute in Indianapolis, sometimes referred to as CI Indy, was an apolitical, non-profit organization established by IUPUI, Sun Yat-sen University in China, and Hanban (The Office of Chinese Language Council International) to promote the teaching of Chinese language and culture in central Indiana.  

CI Indy and the Indianapolis Mayor's Office established the annual Chinese Festival of Indianapolis beginning in 2010. The Lilly Chinese Culture Network, Indianapolis Chinese Community Center, Chinese American Society, and other organizations joined with CI Indy to promote Chinese culture and celebrate the Chinese who have made great contributions to the city of Indianapolis.""Chinese Classes and Activities.” Confucius Institute in Indianapolis Newsletter, Fall 2010. https://archives.iupui.edu/handle/2450/7300

The Confucius Institute at IUPUI was closed on April 3, 2019, with IU citing financial issues surrounding federal changes to Chinese language programs.Redden, Elizabeth. “Indiana Closes Confucius Institute.” Inside Higher Ed | Higher Education News, Events and Jobs, April 7, 2019. Confucius Institutes were criticized by Republic politicians for their alleged efforts to spread communist propaganda. Indiana Representative Jim Banks released a statement saying ""The Chinese Communist Party in Beijing knows that U.S. universities are home to important research, some of which involves sensitive national security information funded by U.S. federal departments. By using businesses and cultural exchanges as fronts, the Chinese government infiltrates these institutions and steal our nation’s intellectual property and secrets. Thanks to the necessary steps by IUPUI and MIT, more schools are waking up to this reality, and I suspect many more will follow their lead.”Brown, Alex. “IUPUI Closes Confucius Institute.” Inside Indiana Business, April 5, 2019.

 University Writing Center 
The University Writing Center (UWC) was founded in 1983 by IU English Professor Barbara Cambridge. The first staff members consisted of English professors and a couple of student tutors. Its initial services included 30-minute writing sessions, a grammar hotline, and writing workshops across all academic departments.“History of the UWC: University Writing Center.” University Writing Center | School of Liberal Arts Programs, October 10, 2022. In 1990, Cambridge established the Writing Fellows Program, which provided formal writing education for undergraduates. The center is part of the English program at the IU School of Liberal Arts. In 1999, the Writing Center moved from the fifth floor to the third to create more space for writing assistance and mentoring. In the late 1990s, the UWC established satellite centers in University College, now known as Joseph T. Taylor Hall, and the Ball Residence Hall. In 2007, the University Library established the Learning Commons on the second floor, and the UWC moved to occupy part of the space.

 The Public Opinion Laboratory (POL) 
The Public Opinion Laboratory was founded in 1986 by IU Sociology Professor, Brian S. Vargus, and located on the fourth floor of Cavanaugh Hall. The laboratory quickly outgrew its original space and moved to a larger space on the second floor to accommodate the increasing student workers. The lab was completely student-run and performed polling for IUPUI and private clients.

663,35467,76005687,18228,"Banque de l'Indochine Building, Shanghai","The Banque de l'Indochine Building (), is a building designed by architecture firm Atkinson & Dallas as a branch building for the Banque de l'Indochine, in The Bund, Shanghai. The building is at No.29, The Bund, and was built in the former Shanghai International Settlement. Construction began in 1911 and ended in 1914 by contractor Xie Sheng Construction Plant. It currently houses the China Everbright Bank.

The Banque de l'Indochine building is the only building in the Bund to have only 3 floors, and is one of the shortest buildings of the Bund. However, with an average floor height of 7.3 metres, out of all the buildings in the Bund, it has the highest average floor height. It is also the only building in the Bund which was completely constructed with French investment.

History

The Banque de l'Indochine established a branch in Shanghai in 1899, within the French concession.

The Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris was a major shareholder of the Russo-Chinese Bank and the Banque de l'Indochine, and when the Russo-Chinese Bank opened its branch in Shanghai in 1896, it was housed in No.29, The Bund. The original building at No.29, The Bund, was previously owned by the Bank of Hindustan, China and Japan and was a two-storey brick and timber East Indian-style house. It was bought by the Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris before the Banque de l'Indochine or the Russo-Chinese Bank established a branch in China. In 1902, the Russo-Chinese Bank bought No.15, The Bund, after the bankruptcy of its previous owner, Dent & Co. The bank was moved there (now the Russo-Chinese Bank Building). The Banque de l'Indochine subsequently moved into No.29, The Bund. The branch was mainly used for issuing banknotes, taking in deposits, and supporting French businesses in China.

In 1911, to meet increasing business demands, the Banque de l'Indochine demolished the original building and constructed the Banque de l'Indochine building at the same address, No 29, The Bund.

After the Battle of Shanghai in 1937 and the subsequent occupation of the Shanghai International Settlement in 1941, Japanese forces occupied all of Shanghai. However, the Banque de l'Indochine could continue its services because of the neutrality of Vichy France. 

During World War II, the formation of Vichy France meant that the Banque de l'Indochine was still able to operate normally.

After the Surrender of Japan, all Japanese businesses in Shanghai were cleared, and the Banque de l'Indochine's business grew as the competition decreased.

In 1949, after the victory of the Chinese Communist Party in the Chinese Civil War, the Banque de l'Indochine was made a 'designated bank' by the new government to act as a medium for foreign currency exchange.

However, in the 1950s, foreign investment and businesses gradually left China, causing business for the Banque de l'Indochine unsuitable. In 1955, the Banque de l'Indochine withdrew their branch in Shanghai.

In 1956, the vacant building was taken over by the Shanghai Municipal Housing Authority, and began to house the Traffic Department of Shanghai Public Security Bureau.

In 1989, The Banque de l'Indochine building was designated as an 'Outstanding Historical Building of Shanghai' by the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, in the first batch of such designated buildings.

In 1995, China Everbright Bank responded to the call of the Shanghai Municipal Committee and Municipal Government to rebuild the financial street on the Bund and moved from No. 2 Tianjin Road to the Banque de l'Indochine building as a trade-off. The building was again re-established as a bank.

In 1996, the Banque de l'Indochine building was mentioned in the fourth batch of Major cultural heritage site under national-level protection by the State Council of the People's Republic of China, alongside the whole Bund complex, as 'Important near-modern historical sites and representative buildings'

Architecture
The Banque de l'Indochine building is a building designed in the Renaissance, Baroque, and Neoclassical architectural styles.

 Exterior 
The east façade of the building is the main façade, with a tripartite design, a typical French classical construction. The main entrance of the building facade is the main axis, and the two sides are symmetrical. There are two Ionic columns running through the second and third floors, and a deformed Palladian motif is used for the middle span of the first floor.

The doors and windows of the main entrance on the first floor are visually enhanced. The main entrance of the building facade is the main axis, and the two sides are symmetrical. The main entrance is slightly larger than the other four window openings next to it in order to enhance it visually. Two Tuscan columns are used to support an architrave, frieze and a broken pediment. An arch is made into a niche to emphasise the scroll-shaped broken pediment. There are shield-shaped decorations on the spandrels on both sides.

The east façade, as well as the north and south façades of the building, are faced with Suzhou granite, with the surface roughened. The west façade is cement rendered. The columns at the main entrance and running through the second and third floors are made of polished Qingdao granite.

 Interior 
 

The wood decoration within the interior is teak, with a Baroque decorative style. When it was first built, the centre of the first floor was the bank's hall, a large space supported by six Ionic columns. The six columns are divided into two rows, dividing the ceiling into three sections. The beams on the left and right sections of the ceiling form a grid-shaped ceiling with exquisite moldings and dense dentil decoration. The middle section of the ceiling is covered with a rectangular arched glass ceiling. The glass ceiling is supported by fine arch ribs and is partially decorated. Low teak counters are arranged along the columns in the hall. The six columns have rectangular teak plinths at the bottom, which are connected with the counters. The walls around the hall are covered with Ionic pilasters.

The second and third floors were originally bank staff apartments. There was a lighting courtyard in the centre to provide natural lighting for the staff apartments and for the first-floor glass ceiling to provide natural lighting for the hall.

Alterations
A project to restore and protect the building was started in 2010, mostly to restore the building to what it looked like originally after multiple changes and damages to the building during its history.
Exterior
Facade
The facade was in good condition before the restoration. The main changes were cleaning the exterior wall and removing additions to it, such as exterior air conditioning units, and sorting the exposed pipes and wires. At the same time, the size of the company signage was reduced, and the material was changed from high-gloss to Matte.
Interior
Glass ceiling
The original arched glass ceiling was restored to a cylindrical curved surface from a curved rectangular surface. 

Because the lighting courtyard of the building was covered by a concrete floor on the third floor, no natural light was able to light the hall. This was restored through the addition of LED lights at the inner arches of the ceiling that shine onto an arched reflective gypsum board above the glass ceiling, using soft and homogeneous reflected light to simulate natural lighting. 
Interior main entrance
The main door on the west facade was restored to its original Baroque style, with wooden parapets and marble floor with ceramic mosaic tiles.",2025-03-10,"['Buildings and structures in Shanghai'

 Production 
 Pre-production 
Vishwambhara was announced under the tentative title Mega 156, intending to be Chiranjeevi's 156th film, on 22 August 2023, which was also his birthday. It was launched with a muhurtam pooja on 23 October 2023 in Hyderabad, and was attended by the film's crew and many other famous people of Telugu cinema. The film is being produced under the banner UV Creations. 

It was initially rumoured that the film would be a sequel to the 1990 fantasy film, Jagadeka Veerudu Athiloka Sundari, which also starred Chiranjeevi in the lead role. Thereafter, Vyjayanthi Movies announced on Twitter that only they had the rights to use the film in any derivative form, including producing a sequel. While Vishwambhara's crew was not explicitly called out by the film production house, it was rumoured that they were trying to warn them of the consequences of an unauthorised reproduction of Jagadeka Veerudu Athiloka Sundari. Vassishta clarified afterwards that his film was a new story and was completely unrelated to the film.

 Filming 
Thirteen distinct sets were created and erected in Hyderabad's Annapurna Studios, and production designer, A. S. Prakash, supervised the construction of the sets. It was reported that approximately 70% of the film will heavily incorporate visual effects, in order to showcase spiritual elements. In late 2023 and through January 2024, a few scenes that did not feature Chiranjeevi were shot in Maredumilli. He joined the sets in early February 2024. The overseas rights were purchased and acquired by film distributor Sarigama Cinemas for a price of 18 crore. As a result of the unavailability of Asin and Anushka Shetty, Trisha Krishnan was cast as the lead heroine, thus marking her return to Telugu cinema after 8 years since Nayaki. 

The crew began a filming schedule in the city of Nalgonda, but subsequently returned to Hyderabad to resume shooting in late February. During the Hyderabad production schedule, an action sequence and a few songs were shot. The crew filmed a song sequence choreographed by Shobhi Master. The song will also reportedly feature a set, which was previously used in Guntur Kaaram. Vijay Binni also choreographed another song for the film. At Ramoji Film City, an action block was shot in a constructed forest environment. The fight sequence happens while amidst water, mud, and dust. Throughout the scene, the fighters, including Chiranjeevi, were covered in mud. To give the mud a realistic appearance, it was made using real sand. Afterwards, another filming schedule commenced in late 2024 at Lingampally to film the interval action scene in a large set with a  Hanuman statue erected by A. S. Prakash. 

On 22 April 2024, the action sequence finished completion after twenty-six days, and represents the longest time Chiranjeevi has spent on a single stunt scene in his entire career.  Another schedule commenced on 22 May 2024, and the main portion of the film was shot at the Annapurna Seven Acres studio in Hyderabad.

 Music 
The film's music is composed by M. M. Keeravani. The first single titled ""Rama Raama"" was released on 12 April 2025, coinciding Hanuman Jayanti.

In April 2024, it was reported that director Anil Ravipudi might be involved in the project and that planning was underway for a release in early 2025.",2025-04-19,"['UV Creations films' 'Films scored by M. M. Keeravani'

670,56775,5404775,16182,Nandina,"Nandina domestica ( ) commonly known as nandina, heavenly bamboo or sacred bamboo, is a species of flowering plant in the family Berberidaceae, native to eastern Asia from the Himalayas to Japan. It is the only member of the monotypic genus Nandina. It is widely grown in gardens as an ornamental plant with a number of cultivars that display bright-red fall foliage in the cool months, and attractive new foliage growth in spring. Although a popular ornamental shrub, the berries are toxic to birds, especially towards the end of the winter when other food sources become scarce.

The Latin genus name Nandina is derived from the Japanese name .Gledhill, David (2008). ""The Names of Plants"". Cambridge University Press.  (hardback),  (paperback).  pp 145, 268 The specific epithet domestica means 'domesticated', or 'of the household'.

Description

Despite the common name ""sacred bamboo"", it is not a bamboo but an erect evergreen shrub up to  tall by  wide, with numerous, usually unbranched stems growing from ground level. The glossy leaves are sometimes deciduous in colder areas,  long, bi- or tri-pinnately compound, with the individual leaflets  long and 1.5–3 cm broad. 

The young leaves in spring are brightly coloured pink to red before turning green; old leaves turn red or purple again before falling. Its petiolate leaves are 50–100 cm long, compound (two or three pinnacles) with leaflets, elliptical to ovate or lanceolate and of entire margins, 2–10 cm long by 0.5–2 cm wide, with petioles swollen at their bases.

The inflorescences are axillary or terminally erect panicles with numerous hermaphrodite flowers. There are several ovate-oblong sepals of a pinkish white color, and six oblong white petals, each 4 by 2.5 mm. The flowers are borne in early summer in conical clusters held well above the foliage. The fruit is a bright red berry, 5–10 mm diameter, ripening in late autumn and often persisting through the winter.

Garden history and cultivation

N. domestica, grown in Chinese and Japanese gardens for centuries, was brought to Western gardens by William Kerr, who sent it to London in his first consignment from Canton, in 1804.Alice M. Coats, Garden Shrubs and Their Histories (1964) 1992, s.v. ""Nandina"". English breeders, unsure of its hardiness, kept it in greenhouses at first. The scientific name given to it by Carl Peter Thunberg is a Latinized version of a Japanese name for the plant, nan-ten. Over 65 cultivars have been named in Japan, where the species is particularly popular and a national Nandina society exists. In Shanghai berried sprays of nandina are sold in the streets at New Year, for the decoration of house altars and temples.

Nandina does not berry profusely in Great Britain, but it can be grown in USDA hardiness zones 6–10 with some cultivars hardy into zone 5. Nandina can take heat and cold, from . It generally needs no pruning, but can spread via underground runners and can be difficult to remove.

Nandina is extremely toxic to birds""Why birds don't eat nandina berries"" by Rett Davis, The Times News, 28 November 2014. and mammals.""Nandina Berries Kill Birds Popular garden shrub berries are toxic to birds and other animals"", by Jerry W. Davis, Audubon Arkansas, 28 January 2016. Spent berry stalks can easily be snapped off by hand in spring. Due to the naturally occurring phytochemicals (see above) this plant is commonly used in rabbit, deer, and javelina resistant landscape plantings.

Cultivars
These are some of the popular cultivars of this plant:

Blush – Slightly smaller than the above, it produces red new growth in spring and autumn, and in winter months it turns vivid red.Blush™ Nandina domestica
Fire Power – Height of 2 to 2 1/2 feet tall, is so-named for its impressive red fall and winter foliage.What Are the Different Types of Nandina Shrubs?
Gulfstream – Reaching 3 feet wide and 3 to 3 1/2 feet tall, it features narrow, diamond-shaped leaves which are orange-tinted and coppery when young that develop to turquoise in summer, then turn orange-red in fall.
Lemon Lime – Yellowish green spring foliage that transforms to chartreuse in summer.
Moon Bay – Dense and upright reaching 1m, its diamond-shaped leaves (which are similar to Gulfstream) change seasonally from lime green, red, apricot and burgundy.
Moyer's Red –  A semi dwarf type that grows 4 to 6 feet tall that features light-pink flowers.
Nana – A dwarf variety suited for a low hedge, it features foliage that turns into lime green to crimson red and scarlet-bronze tones in the cooler months.
Obsession – Related to the above, it grows 2 to 2 1/2 feet tall and wide and features scarlet spring and fall foliage.
Richmond – 1–1.5 metres tall. In summer, it bears panicles of white flowers followed by bright-red berries in winter.
Royal Princess – Reaching up to 8 feet tall, this displays blush-coloured blooms.
Sienna Sunrise – Growing 3–4 feet tall, it features glaring red foliage with red highlights in fall.

Toxicity
All parts of the plant are poisonous, containing compounds that decomposeAbrol, Y. P.; Conn, E. E.; Stoker, J. R. (1966) “Studies on the identification, biosynthesis and metabolism of a cyanogenic glucoside in Nandina domestica Thunb.”.  Phytochemistry 5(5):1021–1027 doi:10.1016/S0031-9422(00)82800-9Olechno, J. D.; Poulton, J. E.; Conn, E. E. “Nandinin: An acylated free cyanohydrin from Nandina domestica”. (1984) Phytochemistry 23(8):1784–1785 doi:10.1016/S0031-9422(00)83491-3 to produce hydrogen cyanide, and could be fatal if ingested. The plant is generally considered non-toxic to humans, but the berries are considered toxic to cats and grazing animals. Excessive consumption of the berries will kill birds such as cedar waxwings, because they are subject to cyanide toxicosis, resulting in death to multiple individuals at one time.

The berries also contain alkaloids such as nantenine, which is used in scientific research as an antidote to MDMA (ecstasy).

Status as an invasive species
Nandina is considered invasive in Texas, North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, and Florida.  It was placed on the Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council's invasive list as a Category I species, the highest listing. It has been observed in the wild in Florida in Gadsden, Leon, Jackson, Alachua and Citrus counties, in conservation areas, woodlands and floodplains.  In general, the purchase or continued cultivation of non-sterile varieties in the southeastern United States is discouraged.

It is also becoming invasive in wild areas farther north, and in May 2017 was added to the Maryland invasive plant list with a tier 2 status.

Although grown extensively in Texas because of its tolerance for dry conditions, fruiting varieties of Nandina are considered invasive there. This is primarily due to birds spreading seeds into natural areas where Nandina proliferates and crowds out native species, both through seeding and by the growth of rhizomatous underground stems.

677,36440,76024202,5162,Antônio Prado Square,"Antônio Prado Square (Portuguese: Praça Antônio Prado), formerly known as Largo do Rosário, is located in the Sé district of the Brazilian city of São Paulo. São Bento, João Brícola and Quinze de Novembro streets intersect at the square.

 History 
The square's current name is a tribute to Antônio da Silva Prado, a coffee grower, banker, jurist, journalist and politician who held several public positions throughout his life. As mayor of São Paulo, he implemented major urban improvements, such as the straightening of many streets in the city center. The square, which once housed the old Church of the Rosary of Black Men, received the city's first monument in honor of Zumbi dos Palmares at the end of 2016.

Today, the site preserves architectural influences from the 20th century, such as the wooden kiosks selling newspapers and magazines and offering services such as public telephones and shoeshine.

 Nichile's public clock 
Antônio Prado Square is home to Nichile's last public clock, which measures  and was registered in 1992 for its historical value. It was built in 1935 and, since Octávio de Nichile's death in 1986, it has been maintained by his family. There were a total of six clocks spread across the city of São Paulo in areas such as Largo do Arouche and Sé Square. Their implementation resulted from the work of executive Octávio de Nichile, who sold the advertising spaces in the structure of the poles that supported the clocks.

681,11377,5282134,12359,Frank M. Canton,"Frank M. Canton (born Josiah Horner, September 15, 1849 – September 27, 1927) was an American Old West fugitive who had a career as a deputy U.S. marshal under an assumed name. Although an ex-sheriff stock detective in Wyoming, Canton and his associates were accused of operating more by assassination than the law. Extrajudicial measures such as the lynching of Ellen Watson inflamed public opinion against the long-established big ranchers Canton worked for, and to re-establish control over grazing they funded an all-out assault on those small operators considered to be rustlers. Canton directed Frank Wolcott's imported gunmen in their planned vigilante campaign, known as the Johnson County War, which was quickly ended by a local posse. Finding himself a marked man in Wyoming, Canton considered it opportune to leave the state. He spent most of the rest of his working life in law enforcement for the court of hanging judge Isaac C. Parker.

Biography

Early life
Josiah Horner was born on September 15, 1849, in Harrison Township, Henry County, Indiana (Canton in his own autobiography, ""Frontier Trails"" though admitted he was born in Virginia, about 15 miles from Richmond and drifted into Texas working as a cowboy. In 1871, he started robbing banks and rustling cattle, which at the time was a capital offense. On October 10, 1874, Horner got into a gunfight with some Buffalo Soldiers, killing one and wounding the other. In 1877, he was arrested for robbing a bank in Comanche, Texas. He escaped from Texas Ranger custody and fled to Ogallala, Nebraska, and took up ranching under the alias Frank M. Canton.Once Upon a Time in Wyoming The Story of Stock Detective - Tom Horn - by Corey Retter, pp. 12–13.

Johnson County War
Frank Canton was hired on as a stock detective for the Wyoming Stock Growers Association at a time of escalating tension between the wealthy cattlemen, rustlers and the burgeoning population of homesteading incomers who were by sheer numbers putting an end to ""free ranging"", and altering the balance of political power. Elected sheriff of Johnson County, Wyoming in 1885, he was seen as a strong right hand of the cattle barons, and the tone of a letter from the Pinkerton Agency recommending Tom Horn to Canton confirms that he took a very hard line against rustling suspects. He served for four years, but resigned after the foreman of one of the big ranches suspiciously escaped his custody. Although still working part-time as a U.S. Deputy Marshal, rumours circulated he was as much paid assassin and intimidator as detective. The unsolved shooting dead of a law abiding homesteader who had said Canton threatened his life because he had evidence against Canton's friends as culprits in an earlier murder made him distrusted by the homesteading faction. With a mob forming, Canton was arrested, but several big ranchers stood surety for him and his lawyer got him released, whereupon he left the state. By the time further evidence against him was found he was in Illinois, and the matter was dropped.

During the Johnson County War, Canton returned as local guide for Frank Wolcott's largely Texan hirelings who were to execute a death list of alleged rustlers Canton had drawn up. On April 9, 1892, Canton led the so-called Regulators to the ""KC Ranch"", where their number one targets Nate Champion (a witness against some of Canton's friends for a murder) and Nick Ray were staying. Ray was shot and killed in the opening minutes of the ensuing gunbattle. Champion killed at least four of the Regulators and wounded others. At 5:00 p.m., Canton set the house on fire. Champion burst out of the house firing his Winchester rifle and was shot 28 times. Two days later a huge posse, led by Sheriff Angus surrounded the Regulators at the ""TA Ranch"" and only the U.S. Cavalry's arrival rescued Canton and his companions from having to surrender. With the newspapers portraying them in a favourable light due to the influence of powerful ranching interests, Canton like the other regulators was freed. He again put several hundred miles between him and Wyoming, this time for good.Once Upon a Time in Wyoming The Story of Stock Detective - Tom Horn - By Corey Retter, pp. 30–46.

Life in Oklahoma

Continuing in law enforcement, Canton traveled to what is now Oklahoma, and as a Deputy U.S. Marshal based out of Fort Smith, Arkansas, he worked with other famous lawmen such as Heck Thomas, Chris Madsen, Bass Reeves and Bill Tilghman in the Indian territories. In 1895, Canton joined a posse that tracked down Bill and John Shelley, who had escaped from the Pawnee jail and barricaded themselves in a cabin across the Arkansas River. After 5 hours and more than 800 shots fired, Canton sent a burning wagon into the cabin, and the outlaws surrendered.

On November 6, 1896 in Pawnee, Oklahoma, Canton shot dead Bill Dunn in the street.O'Neal, Bill. Encyclopedia of Western Gunfighters. University of Oklahoma Press (March 15, 1991). p. 95.  As Canton told it, Dunn said ""Damn you, Canton. I've got it in for you!"" before reaching his pistol, which got caught in his suspender while Canton drew and fired hitting Dunn in the head and killing him instantly. If this truly happened, it would be one of the very few examples of an incident resembling a Western film-style fast draw shooting actually occurring; the local law enforcement that Canton worked with ruled it self-defense.

Later life
In 1897, Canton went to Alaska to follow the gold rush, but his work as a Deputy U.S. Marshal ended in disputed circumstances with assertions he had misused public money. He returned to the states in 1907 and became Adjutant General for the Oklahoma National Guard. Canton confessed that he was Horner, and the Governor of Texas granted him a pardon. 

End of life
By 1925, age had visibly overtaken Canton. He had grown bald, his vision was impaired and light-sensitive and he had almost completely lost his hearing. Unable to perform as a cattleman or a lawman, he was then unemployed. The Texas Cattlemen's Association awarded him a small pension. His unmarried adult daughter, Ruby, helped support Canton and his wife, Annie, moved into Ruby's home. On September 1, 1927, he could not get out of bed, so Ruby summoned a doctor. After examining the patient, the doctor announced that he had terminal cancer and would have to remain in bed, since he had only a few days to live. On September 15, the family celebrated his seventy-eighth birthday at Ruby's home. Canton died on September 27, 1927, in Edmond, Oklahoma.""Horner, Joe (a.k.a. Frank M. Canton)"", in The Encyclopedia of Lawmen, Outlaws, and Gunfighters by Leon Claire Metz (Infobase Publishing, 2003), p. 122.

Dramatic representations
 Canton is played by Sam Waterston in Heaven's Gate (1980). He is portrayed, however, as a senior cattle baron, rather than a detective and lawman living in 1890.
 Canton is the basis for Jesse Jacklin in the 2002 television movie Johnson County War.
 Canton, played by Ed Nelson, is a guest character in the ""What Happened at the XST?"" episode (1972) of Alias Smith and Jones.
 After his death, Canton was proposed as Owen Wister's direct inspiration for ""The Virginian,"" though Wister's journals did not support that claim.",2025-04-16,"['1849 births' '1927 deaths' 'American bank robbers' 'American cattlemen'

Biography
Born in Ambleny on 12 November 1939, Versini-Campinchi was born in a family home in which he lived his whole life. He was of Corsican origin on his father's side, with the Versini and Campinchi families coming from villages along the . He was the grand-nephew of César Campinchi, a prominent lawyer, a member of the Chamber of Deputies, and Minister of the Navy in the French Third Republic. His mother was of Martinican origin and raised by his maternal grandfather, Robert Attuly, a magistrate and the first West Indian to serve on the Court of Cassation. Married at the age of 20, Versini-Campinchi had three daughters from a first marriage and two more children from a second. His son, François, was also a lawyer.

Versini-Campinchi first specialized in commercial and highly contentious cases before moving towards criminal law in the 1980s. His firm was made up of three partners: himself, Fanny Colin, and Alexandre Merveille. The firm mainly dealt with criminal cases and commercial disputes. He was a member of the Paris Bar Association from 2003 to 2005.

In the 1990s, Versini-Campinchi represented GIFCO in a case of financing the French Communist Party, in which he obtained recusal of the president of the correctional chamber. In the Michel Mouillot case, he defended the former mayor of Cannes accused of corruption and obtained the recusal of investigating judge Murciano de Grasse. At the end of the 1990s and start of the 2000s, he represented businessman Jeffrey Steiner at the beginning of the . He also represented Jean-Christophe Mitterrand during the Mitterrand–Pasqua affair, in which he was acquitted on charges of human trafficking.

Versini-Campinchi represented founder of Buffalo Grill , who was accused of violating the embargo on English meats allegedly responsible for Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. During the trial, Versini-Campinchi was sanctioned by the Paris Bar Association for violating the secrecy of the investigation. The case was taken up to the Court of Cassation and the European Court of Human Rights, which are studied today as case law on the interception of telephone communications between a lawyer and their client.

In the , Versini-Campinchi, alongside , defended Maurice Agnelet, who was convicted of the murder of Agnès Le Roux. However, Agnelet maintained his innocence and was eventually acquitted of the charges. He represented Prime Minister François Fillon in his opposition to Jean-Pierre Jouyet. He also represented Vinci SA following a complaint from the Association Sherpa on the treatment of construction workers in Qatar. In the Uramin affair, he represented former Areva president Anne Lauvergeon. In 2017, he became the lawyer for Bernard Laporte, president of the French Rugby Federation. In 2019, he defended , former Parquet national financier, prosecuted by the .

For many years, Versini-Campinchi campaigned to remove authorization for lawyers to wear decorations on their attire. He also refused the Legion of Honour bestowed upon him by the Minister of Justice in 2011.

Outside of his professional life, Versini-Campinchi also inspired a bill allowing parents to declare their home to be the birthplace of their children, not the hospital in which they were born. He created the Association Renaissance des Villages alongside Jean-Cyril Spinetta.

Jean-Pierre Versini-Campinchi died on 12 October 2023, at the age of 83.

It is in that sense the inverse correlate of the chief. In French heraldry, the champagne is considered an ""honourable ordinary"" (), but in English heraldry, it is frequently omitted from lists of the honourable ordinaries, and grouped, if at all, with the subordinaries. The diminutive of the base, occupying one half the height of the ordinary, is termed  in French heraldry. Another, now less common, English language term for the base is the foot, a usage the recalls the German , Danish , and Dutch .

In English heraldry, the terms base, terrace in base, and champagne are synonyms that include both charges with a straight-line upper edge running parallel to the chief and those with an upper edge curved or otherwise varied. Standard variations are the mount and trimount. In French heraldry in contrast, the terms champagne and its diminutive plaine are reserved for those with straight upper edges and the term terrasse (terrace in base) for those with curved or otherwise varied upper edges. Champagnes that take step-wise lines of division or variation are blasoned in French as . The latter (terrasse) are furthermore classed as mobile charges rather than honourable ordinaries.

691,28477,75777457,12843,Kidnapping of Mia Schem,"On 7 October 2023, Mia Schem (), a French-Israeli woman, was abducted by Hamas during the Re'im music festival massacre, part of the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel. Her abduction, a video of her in captivity in Gaza, and subsequent release on 30 November garnered international media attention, and she became a face of the hostage crisis during the Israel–Hamas war.

 Background 
Mia Schem was 21 years old at the time of her abduction, and is a French-Israeli living in Shoham. Before the 7 October attacks, she worked at the Liav Tattoo studio. She was abducted during the attack on the Nova music festival, near Re'im during the 7 October attacks.

Abduction
On 7 October 2023, Hamas militants attacked the Nova music festival near Re'im, Israel as part of the Hamas attack on Israel. During the ensuing Re'im music festival massacre, 364 civilians were killed and forty were taken hostage into the Gaza Strip. Schem attended the festival with her friend, 28-year-old French-Israeli Elia Toledano. During the attack at 7:17 am, Schem messaged a friend saying, ""They are shooting at us please come save us.""

Schem recounted that she was abducted by militants after she left her friend's burning vehicle during the attack. Schem was shot in the arm at point blank by a Hamas terrorist, and she and Toledano were both abducted and taken hostage into Gaza. Toledano's body was later discovered by the Israel Defense Forces during an operation in December. A militant reportedly began to touch her upper body inappropriately and only stopped after she screamed and the militant noticed that she had been wounded. Someone else dragged her into a car and drove her into Gaza.

Captivity and treatment
Immediately before being transported back to Israel, Schem was coerced by Hamas to give a recorded statement in English claiming she was treated with care and hospitality. Schem has been stating that everyone had been very kind and the food was very good during her time as a hostage. She later stated in an interview that she was forced by Hamas to say this into the camera.

Schem was reportedly initially held by a Gazan family with young kids who would open the door to the room where she was being held just to stare at her. During her captivity, Schem was held in a room with her captor while his wife and children were in an adjacent room. Reportedly, the man's wife would bring him food, without bringing any for Schem, and some days she would not be allowed to eat at all. At one point, Schem's captor reportedly forced her to watch her mother speaking at a news conference calling for Schem's release. She reported being taunted and emotionally abused by her captors, who would say that she would be like Gilad Shalit.

After three days of captivity, Schem was dressed in a hijab and forced to undergo surgery for her gunshot wound. For days afterward, she reportedly received no painkillers and had to replace her own bandages. The day after the surgery, she was forced to film a video which was released by Hamas. Hamas released the video of Schem on 16 October, and was the first person to appear in a Hamas hostage video. In the video, Schem says she was injured and pleads to be returned to her family. She appeared pale and had a long, fresh scar clearly visible and an injured arm.

Schem was reportedly moved between Gazan homes via ambulance. Several days before her release, Schem reported she was taken into Hamas tunnels 200 feet underground where she encountered other Israeli hostages for the first time during her captivity.

 Efforts to release 
Shortly after the release of the video showing Schem in October 2023, Schem's mother Keren reached out to world leaders with a focus on French President Emmanuel Macron to secure the release of Schem, calling her and other hostages abductions a crime against humanity. The French government condemned the video and led Schem's mother Keren to hold a press conference in Tel Aviv calling for her immediate release.

Release and aftermath
Schem was one of eight hostages freed after 54 days in captivity on 30 November as part of 105 hostages released during a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. She and Amit Soussana were handed over to the International Red Cross, and were accompanied by IDF and security service agents into Israel. French President Emmanuel Macron described her release as a ""great joy"". The Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum praised her ""fighting spirit"".

Several weeks later, Schem sat for a pair of televised interviews with Channel 12 and Channel 13 that aired on 29 December. Schem's account of her time in captivity mirrored the poor treatment recounted by other hostages and touched a particular nerve in Israel. Schem recounted that she had ""experienced Hell. Everyone there are terrorists... there are no innocent civilians, not one."" Also in December 2023, Schem planned and received a tattoo commemorating her experiences and memorializing those that were lost with the phrase ""we will dance again"" and date of 7 October 2023.

According to her family, the trauma and lack of sleep during captivity caused her to experience epilepsy after her release. Schem was a guest at Elton John's 96th Academy Awards viewing party in March 2024. At the party she wore a rhinestone pin expressing solidarity with the hostages still held and was photographed with Sarah Idan, the former Miss Iraq 2016, who wore a dress which named the remaining female hostages.

In March 2025, Schem was allegedly drugged and raped by an Israeli fitness trainer.",2025-04-10,"['Hostage taking in Israel' 'Israel–Hamas war hostage crisis'

The massacre was carried out by RENAMO rebels who ambushed a large civilian vehicle convoy which was traveling northward. Similar massacres had occurred nearby in the previous months such as the Taninga Massacres with RENAMO aiming to cut the capital of Maputo off from the rest of the country. 

Massacre
The attack occurred in the afternoon on 28 November when a large group of RENAMO rebels opened fire from both sides of the road towards a large vehicle convoy with machine guns and bazookas. The civilian convoy was accompanied by a military escort which was common due to other massacres nearby during the previous months, however the military was vastly outgunned and unable to put up an effective resistance against the rebels. It was only until the military escort called in support from the air force that the rebels dispersed. By the end of the massacre rebels had killed a total of 71 civilians and injured another 78 as well as destroying a total of 32 vehicles, including a USAID truck. The military escort lost 2 soldiers and killed 4 RENAMO rebels.  Survivors of the attack also recounted widespread looting by rebels.

693,52769,5393676,5219,Framsden,"Framsden is a village and civil parish located around  north of Ipswich and  south of the small market town of Debenham in the English county of Suffolk. The total population of Framsden in the census of 2001 was 299, with 125 households, 52 people under 16 years, 201 of working age and 46 over 65 years, increasing to a population of 357 in 137 households at the 2011 Census.

Geography
The majority of homes are situated along Framsden Street, with smaller clusters at Peats Corner, along the A1120 and St John's Row, in addition to more scattered houses towards Otley and Cretingham. The B1077 runs through the west of the Parish, and the A1120 cuts across the north of the Parish. Framsden is mostly within the Helmingham Estate, and a lot of property is tenanted.  These are traditional estate 2-bedroom cottages or large farmhouses. The estate cottages and school were designed 150 years ago by Lord John Tollemache, to provide dwellings for estate workers.  Two cottages shared a bread oven, and each had an acre of land to grow food for the family and to fatten a pig.  These cottages, once home to working families, are now described as 'quaint' and are mostly privately rented.

The village has a public house and village hall as well as Helmingham Primary School and Old Schoolhouse Nursery. The parish church is dedicated to St Mary and a Baptist chapel is also located in the parish. In the middle of the 20th century Framsden had 2 blacksmiths, 2 butchers and an abattoir, 2 windmills, a carpenter, wheelwright, pony carts and hurdle maker, brickmaker, cobbler, grocers shop, a horse-drawn cart for transport to Ipswich, a 'carrier'- taking goods to and from Ipswich and a tailor at Hill House. The village shop and post office on the street closed in the early 1990s, and the village now has few basic services. All essential services can be accessed at Debenham, including the High School.

History
Oral History about Framsden has been captured by authors such as George Ewart Evans in Where Beards Wag All, by Robert Simper in Family Fields and more recently by a 'libraries and heritage' project to record interviews of Helmingham estate workers, such as the Clerk of Works and Farm Manager who were employed over 30 years ago.  Another Framsden resident has had his reminiscences of early years as a gamekeeper published.

Webster's Mill, Framsden is a landmark in the village.

Natural environment
The village is surrounded by arable farmland, much of which is managed by the Helmingham Estate. This includes preserving veteran trees, ancient hedgerows, old ponds and ancient meadows rich in plant and wildlife diversity.  These achievements have been acknowledged by the estate farm winning the FWAG (Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group) Conservation Award for ""high level of commitment shown to the principles and delivery of conservation, combined with good farming – an innovative approach to cultivations based on minimum tillage across the whole farm"".

Fox Fritillary Meadow nature reserve and Site of Special Scientific Interest is located to the north of the village.

 Biography 
Salvador José Zapata was born on December 24, 1781 in Santa María de Guisamo, Province of A Coruña, Galicia (now Spain).

He emigrated to Cuba at the beginning of the 19th century and started working as an assistant in a pharmacy in Havana. Between 1808 and 1812, he studied in the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Havana, and obtained the title of master of pharmacy, with which he was able to open his own establishment.

Over time he earned a small fortune and when he died in 1854, in his will he left all his belongings to build schools in the city of Havana for poor and underserved children. This is how the Salvador José Zapata Schools (or Zapata Schools) began, and the first school was inaugurated in 1873. By 1876 classes were also given to adults. Afro Cuban painter Pastor Argudín Pedroso had attended one of these schools.

696,4901,360682,5750,Smooth breathing,"The smooth breathing (;  psilí; ) is a diacritical mark used in polytonic orthography. In Ancient Greek, it marks the absence of the voiceless glottal fricative  from the beginning of a word.

Some authorities have interpreted it as representing a glottal stop, but a final vowel at the end of a word is regularly elided (removed) when the following word starts with a vowel and elision would not happen if the second word began with a glottal stop (or any other form of stop consonant). In his Vox Graeca, W. Sidney Allen accordingly regards the glottal stop interpretation as ""highly improbable"".

The smooth breathing mark (  ) is written as on top of one initial vowel, on top of the second vowel of a diphthong or to the left of a capital and also, in certain editions, on the first of a pair of rhos. It did not occur on an initial upsilon, which always has rough breathing (thus the early name  hy, rather than  y) except in certain pre-Koine dialects which had lost aspiration much earlier. 

The smooth breathing was kept in the traditional polytonic orthography even after the  sound had disappeared from the language in Hellenistic times. It has been dropped in the modern monotonic orthography.

History
The origin of the sign is thought to be the right-hand half ( ┤ ) of the letter H, which was used in some archaic Greek alphabets as  while in others it was used for the vowel eta. It was developed by Aristophanes of Byzantium to help readers discern between similar words. For example, ὅρος horos 'boundary' (rough breathing) and ὄρος oros 'mountain' (smooth breathing). In medieval and modern script, it takes the form of a closing half moon (reverse C) or a closing single quotation mark:
 
 

Smooth breathings were also used in the early Cyrillic and Glagolitic alphabets when writing the Old Church Slavonic language. Today it is used in Church Slavonic according to a simple rule: if a word starts with a vowel, the vowel has a psili over it. From the Russian writing system, it was eliminated by Peter the Great during his alphabet and font-style reform (1707). All other Cyrillic-based modern writing systems are based on the Petrine script, so they have never had the smooth breathing.

Coronis
The coronis (, korōnís, ""crow's beak"" or ""bent mark""), the symbol written over a vowel contracted by crasis, was originally an apostrophe after the letter: . In present use, its appearances in Ancient Greek are written over the medial vowel with the smooth breathing mark——and appearances of crasis in modern Greek are not marked.

697,49577,76412801,2663,Daniel Kenrick,"Daniel Kenrick (fl. 1685), also called Daniel Kendrick, was an English physician and poet.

Biography
Kenrick was the son of Samuel Kenrick of Leigh, Gloucestershire. He was born about 1652, and entered as a servitor at Christ Church, Oxford, on 31 March 1666, whence he proceeded B.A. 1669, and M.A. 1674. At the age of thirty-two, when his portrait was engraved by Robert White, Kenrick was practising as a doctor at his native town of Worcester, and was much esteemed there as ‘a man of wit and a jolly companion.’ Several poems by ‘Dr. Kenrick’ appear in ‘The Grove, or a Collection of Original Poems, by W. Walsh, Dr. J. Donne, Mr. Dryden, Mr. Butler, Sir John Suckling, and other eminent hands,’ London, 1721. Kenrick's ‘talents,’ it is declared in the preface, ‘seem equal in panegyrick, satire, and lyric. There is a fire and sprightliness of thinking which runs through all his copies, and to this perhaps he owed that haste in his writing which made him sometimes negligent of Harmony both in Rimes and Numbers.’ We gather from the same source that Kenrick was on terms of intimacy with Mrs. Behn and Purcell the musician, and that he died before the publication of ‘The Grove’ in 1721. There are some verses signed by Kenrick in the fifth vol. of Dryden's ‘Miscellany Poems,’ entitled ‘Upon a Giant Angling.’ These, however, are said by Granger, ‘on the information of Dr. John Wall,’ to have been freely borrowed from a work called ‘The Mock Romans,’ London, 1653, while in Pratt's ‘Cabinet of Poetry’ (1808) these same lines are assigned to Dr. William King. The preface to ‘The Grove’ declares that Kenrick took degrees in divinity as well as physic. He may therefore be identical with Daniel Kenrick, D.D., who preached the assize sermon at Worcester in 1688.",2024-03-28,"['Year of birth missing' 'Year of death missing'

Peters research focuses on children's learning and development, and in particular transitions. She began researching transitions from early childhood education to school, but moved on to include transitions at other life stages, and other kinds of transitions, such as transitions in thinking. She also researches edges and liminal spaces in a variety of contexts, such as cultural borders. Peters and Vanessa Paki co-led the New Zealand parts of a five-country international project, which was funded from the International Research Staff Exchange Scheme, and was called Pedagogies of Educational Transition [POET].

Peters was involved in the 2017 refresh of the early childhood education curriculum Te Whāriki, and is on the Ministry of Education's Curriculum Voices Group, which advises on the implementation of the refreshed curriculum.

Peters is the anthology editor for The Bloomsbury Handbook of Early Childhood Transitions Research, along with Aline-Wendy Dunlop of the University of Strathclyde and Sharon Lynn Kagan, of Columbia University.

 History 
The department goes back to the administrative post (poste administratif) of Ayourou, which was established in 1964. In 2011, the administrative post was separated from the department of Tillabéri and elevated to the department of Ayourou. As a result of the conflict in northern Mali, the government of Niger declared a state of emergency in the department of Ayourou and six other departments in March 2017, which was subsequently extended several times.

703,9489,75239301,4945,Compound Eyes of Tropical,"Compound Eyes of Tropical () is a stop motion animated film by Zhang Xu-zhan. It was first presented at the Taipei Fine Arts Museum and had its world premiere at the Golden Horse Film Festival in the same year. The film was awarded the Best Animated Short Film at the 59th Golden Horse Awards.

 Plot 
The film was adapted from the Southeast Asian folk story The Mouse and the Deer Crossing the River (Chinese: 鼠鹿過河). It is presented from the perspective of a fly's eyes, observing how the mouse and the deer navigate through the treacherous crocodile-infested river to reach the other side.

 Production 
Compound Eyes of Tropical uses puppets made by a traditional Taiwanese paper art technique for death and funeral ceremonies and was shot by a stop motion technique frame-by-frame. The animation is around 16 minutes long and the film took three years to shoot. Through a fly's eyes, the image creates a multi-perspective montage. The film uses Taiwanese folk dance to reimagine the Southeast Asian folk story, presenting a cross-cultural interpretation with multiple viewpoints, using mirrors and shadows as metaphorical symbols for various themes. It highlights the underlying structural similarities in seemingly distinct world cultures.

704,28534,75778478,23842,Freducci map,"The Freducci map is an Italian portolan chart of the Atlantic Ocean depicting portions of both the Old and New Worlds, drafted in Ancona in 1514–1515 or in the first half of the 16th century by Conte di Ottomanno Freducci. It is regarded as the earliest map of Florida, and one of the earliest non-Amerindian maps of northern Central America. It is now held at the Archivio di Stato di Firenze in Florence.

 Background 
Details of the map's creation are not certain, other than that it was signed by Conte di Ottomanno Freducci in Ancona sometime during the first half of the 16th century. The map, thought to have been held 'for a long time' in the private archives of the Istituto de' Bardi, was in 1891 deposited in the public Archivio di Stato di Firenze. It was first brought to scholarly attention by Eugenio Casanova's 1894 monograph, La carta nautica.

 Contents 

The map encompasses parts of both the Old and New Worlds. Of the former is included Western Europe (from Gdańsk to Naples) and Africa (from Ras Amusa, in Tripolitania, to the Bight of Benin, on the Slave Coast). Of the New World are (imperfectly) charted the Atlantic coasts of North and South America between 50º N and 15º S, approximately (from Newfoundland to rio da bestrelas, past Porto Seguro, Bahía).

Toponyms are written in black, except where they were deemed to be of greater importance, in which case they were marked in vermilion ink.

The map features a 32-wind compass rose, a windrose network with a central ring of 16 vertices, two scales on a legend (no indication of the unit of measurement), and a rectilinear series of small numbered discs (through the Azores, along the Tordesillas meridian) marking the latitudes from 60º N to 15º S. The map is signed in the legend, but the date marked therein has been shorn off, and therefore lost.

 Analysis 
 Dating 
Since damage to the parchment has resulted in loss of the map's date, it has taken a bit of work to infer one. Casanova proposed to date the map by inference from extrinsic and intrinsic characteristics. Among the former is the map's author, whose birth and death would place lower and upper bounds on the map's date of creation. Among the intrinsic factors are the geographical features charted and toponyms marked in the map, which would place a lower bound before which the map could not have been created.

Freducci lived from the last quarter of the 15th to the first half of the 16th centuries, and was active as a cartographer at least during 1497–1539. One of his relatives, Angelo Freducci, produced an atlas in 1556 whose New World coastlines closely match those of this map. Casanova deems it more likely that Angelo copied Freducci rather than vice versa, thus accepting 1556 as the upper bound for the map's creation. The 1513 Ponce de Leon discovery of Florida is the latest one evident in the map, with the 1513 Balboa discovery of the Gulf of San Miguel being the earliest one omitted, according to Casanova. Assuming news of these discoveries did not take too long in reaching Freducci, Casanova proffers a creation date in 1513–1516 as acceptable, with one in 1514–1515 as probable.

Recently, some scholarship has pushed the map's probable creation date past 1515, however. For instance, of the 19 toponyms in and about Florida, Peck traces only six of them back to the 1513 Ponce de Leon voyage, noting that the remaining 13 'can easily be traced to much later voyages and later cartography.' Similarly, Peck identifies in the map geographical features of Florida which were not discovered until  1513, like Lake Okeechobee, the St Lucie River, the Thousand Islands, and Cape Canaveral.  Some historians also contend that the delineation of Newfoundland on the map is post-1519, and the toponyms are after about 1525.

 Distortion 
New World coasts and features in the northern hemisphere are shifted a number of degrees north from their true location, with an even greater northerly shift than that in contemporaneous maps. For instance, the portos de las igueas in the Bay of Honduras is placed at 28º 15' N, despite contemporaries placing it at 14º 30' N and 15º 30' N. Similarly, cavo de graba dios is laid at 21º N, whereas others placed it at 13º 30' N, 14º N, and 15º N. In contrast, New World coasts and features in the  hemisphere are shifted some degrees  from their true position.

Additional non-shift distortions evident in the map include scaling. For instance, the Antilles are enlarged by a factor of circa 1.65 relative to Europe.

 Scale 
The map's legend provides two scales, but does not indicate a unit of measurement. Casanova, with reference to the latitudes marked at the Tordesillas meridian, assuming each such degree spans 111,111 metres, calculates 1:12,044,444 and 1:6,260,106 for the coarser and finer scales provided in the legend, respectively. He further opines that the Old World was charted to the finer scale, and the New World to the coarser one.",2024-09-01,"['16th-century maps and globes' 'Historic maps of the Americas'

705,23996,75666009,7767,Late for the Sky (song),"""Late for the Sky"" is a song written by Jackson Browne. It is the opening track and title track from Browne's 1974 album Late for the Sky.

Lyrics and music
AllMusic critic William Ruhlmann describes ""Late for the Sky"" as a ""slow, piano-based ballad in [Browne's] familiar style"" that is ""a typically eloquent description of romantic discord.""  Ultimate Classic Rock critic Michael Gallucci says that while the album plays like ""one long breakup montage"" the title track is key to the story, telling of ""the moment where that tiny glimmer of hope is wiped out by cold, hard reality.""  Browne biographer Mark Bego said that it ""sets the tone"" for the rest of the album. 

The lyrics tell of a relationship that is doomed to fail because the singer's lover's expectations of him are too great. Rolling Stone critic Stephen Holden said that it ""explores an affair at its nadir."" The song starts by describing an argument in which the singer and his lover discuss their relationship from when it began until he realizes that now when he looks at her he sees ""nobody I'd ever known.""  In the second verse the singer acknowledges that ""for me some words come easy/But I know that they don't mean that much/Compared with the things that are said when lovers touch.""  In the bridge the singer notes that he has been fooling himself by imagining that he could be the one who his lover needs.  

The song ends with a restatement of the bridge in which the singer states that he is rushing to catch an early flight because he is ""late for the sky."" According to Browne biographer Rich Wiseman, ""the sky serves as the album's most striking symbol of death/salvation."" Holden similarly stated that the sky is ""the album’s symbol for escape, salvation and death.""

Both Bego and Wiseman have suggested that the song is about Browne's relationship with singer Joni Mitchell.

Bego describes the music as being ""slow and somber"".  Music critic Jon Landau said that the song ""begins with some instrumental meandering that may, at first, seem pointless"" but the song ""gathers momentum"" so that by the chorus ""the music has suddenly and surprisingly become compelling.""  The song has an unusual structure, in which there are two statements of the verse and chorus, followed by the bridge, and then another statement of the chorus before ending with a version of the bridge.

Browne praised the harmony vocals provided by Doug Haywood.  According to Browne:

Personnel
Credits are adapted from the liner notes of The Very Best of Jackson Browne.
Jackson Browne – lead vocals, piano, acoustic guitar
Doug Haywood – bass guitar, harmony vocals
David Lindley – electric guitar
Jai Winding – Hammond organ
Larry Zack – drums 

Reception
Los Angeles Times critic Robert Hilburn said that ""Late for the Sky"" was ""perhaps the album's best designed work"", describing its theme as ""the agony of discovering the reality of an incomplete relationship."" 

Gallucci rated ""Late for the Sky"" as Browne's 6th greatest song. Classic Rock History critic Brian Kachejian rated it as Browne's 9th greatest song.

Other appearances
Despite not being released as a single, ""Late for the Sky"" was included on Browne's compilation albums The Next Voice You Hear: The Best of Jackson Browne in 1997 and The Very Best of Jackson Browne in 2004.

The song was used in Martin Scorsese's 1976 film, Taxi Driver, in a scene where Robert De Niro's character Travis Bickle ""loses what's left of his loose grip on reality.""",2025-04-21,"['Jackson Browne songs' '1974 songs' 'Songs written by Jackson Browne'

 History 

Early Gap
Ancient traditions in liturgical books, of which at least one dates from the fourteenth century, state that the first Bishop of Gap was St. Demetrius, disciple of the Apostles and martyrs.A Demetrius is named in the third letter of John (3 John 12). He is first called a martyr in 1393: Albanés, pp. 439–440. Victor de Buck in the Acta Sanctorum Acta Sanctorum,October, Tomus XI, pp. 795–799. finds nothing inadmissible in these traditions,Quamobrem nil ego video in pristina Vapicensi de S. Demetrio traditione quod fidem superet (p. 798D). De Buck's remark, however, is the conclusion of an argument more than two columns long which seeks to demonstrate that a Roman road passed through Gap and that Gap existed as a civitas. His remark does not address the historicity of Demetrius, only the plausibility that Christianity could have reached Gap in the first century. In fact, he quotes the liturgical biography of Demetrius from the mid-nineteenth century (p. 796E), which states, Sanctum praesulem apostolorum Domini fuisse discipulum non constat quidem monumentis historicis, sed antiquissima est ecclesiae Vapicensis traditio. ('That the holy bishop was a disciple of the apostles of the Lord is not evident in fact from historical materials, but is an ancient tradition of the Church of Gap'). Goyau has deliberately or carelessly misrepresented De Buck's position. De Buck's elaborate argument, however, is inadvertently destroyed by Albanés' observations (pp. 433–434). while Canon Albanès defends themAlbanés' editor, Ulisse Chevalier, remarks about Albanés in his introduction to Gallia christiana novissima: ""Le public attendait avec impatience la mise en oeuvre des arguments que M. Albanés tenait pour irréfragables en faveur de l'apostolicité des églises de Provence. Quelle opinion qu'on ait à cet égard, on regrettera toujours que le représentant le plus autorisé de l'école dite légeendaire n'ait pas eu le temps de résumer des idées qui avaient mis un demi-siècle à s'elaborer dans son esprit.""  against Joseph Roman.Roman (1870), pp. 11–12. Albanès names as bishops of Gap the martyr St. Tigris (fourth century), then St. Remedius (394–419), whom Louis Duchesne makes a Bishop of AntibesDuchesne, p. 101-102, note 2, and he is never named as Bishop of Gap. and who was involved in the struggle between Pope Zosimus and Bishop Proculus of Marseilles. According to Duchesne the first historically known bishop is Constantinus, present at the Council of Epaone in 517. The church of Gap had, among other bishops, Aredius of Gap (or St. Arey, 579–610?), who had at Gap a school,Albanés, p. 457, on the authority of  Albanés says, ""Il prit un soin particulier pour instruire la jeunesse, et l'école de Gap à la fin du Ve siècle est célèbre dans l'histoire. This is a piece of grotesque exaggeration of his source. and who was held in esteem by Pope Gregory the Great. Worth mention is St. Arnoux (1065–1078), who had been a monk of the abbey of Saint-Trinité de Vendome, and was named bishop by Pope Alexander II to replace the simoniac Bishop Ripert. Arnoux became a patron saint of the city of Gap.

Medieval Gap
In 890, the bishops of Provence assembled in the Council of Valence, under the leadership of the archbishops of Lyon, Arles, Embrun, and Vienne. The bishops took note of the fact that Archbishop Bernoin of Vienne had been to Rome to complain to the pope of the increasing disorder of the kingdom since the death of Charlemagne. They singled out the invasions of the Northmen and of the Saracens, who had caused the depopulation of the entire area.J.-D. Mansi (ed.), Sacrorum conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio, edito novissima, Tomus XVIII (Venice: Antonius Zatta 1773), pp. 95–96. On 7 July 1057, Pope Victor II wrote a letter of privileges for Archbishop Winimann (Viminien) of Embrun, whom he had consecrated and to whom he had given the pallium. In the bull, the Pope took note of the invasion, occupation, and devastation of the city of Embrun by the Saracens, a city only 40 km. from Gap. Embrun had also been a place of refuge for undisciplined people fleeing from other localities. The whole of Provence, in fact, suffered from similar difficulties in the eighth and ninth centuries.Fisquet, p. 4.

On 31 July 1178, Bishop Gregory of Gap obtained a bull from the Emperor Frederic Barbarossa which made him Count of the City and territory of Gap. The bishops were still subjects of the Count of Forcalquier, which became the property of Raymond of Bérenger, Count of Provence.Fisquet, p. 3.

Huguenots
In 1561 a Protestant preacher arrived in Gap from Geneva, and on 31 July began public preaching at an old mill next to the church of the Cordeliers outside the walls of Gap. On 16 and 17 November he preached publicly inside the city, at Sainte-Colombe. The consuls of Gap reported the incidents to the Lieutenant-General of the King, La Motte Gondrin, who immediately ordered the guilty preacher to be arrested for violating the king's edict. In 1562, however, the Protestant armies defeated and killed La Motte Gondrin, and on 1 May they attacked and took control of Gap. Bishop Gabriel de Clermont abandoned his post and apostasized. The preacher was released from prison and celebrated the Protestant triumph. In October, however, the Catholics in the neighborhood came up from Tallard and attacked Gap and drove the Protestants out. In 1568 however, bands of Protestant soldiers, encouraged by the successes of the armies of the Prince de Condé, engaged in battle at Gap and massacred more than one hundred Catholics whom they trapped inside the city. They then retired to Veynes and Die, leaving what was left of Gap to the Catholics.  But in September 1576 another Protestant force, led by the Duc de Lesdiguières, having been refused entry into Gap, on the night of 2/3 January 1577 were admitted to the city by Protestants living in Gap, seized and sacked the city. The bishop, Paparin de Chaumont, fled. The episcopal palace, the residence of the canons, the cathedral, and six religious establishments were damaged or destroyed. They held the city until 1581. In September, Bishop Paparin de Chaumont was able to return, under the protection of the Duc de Mayenne and the forces of the Catholic League.Fisquet, pp. 6–10.

French revolution

In 1790 the National Constituent Assembly decided to bring the French church under the control of the State. Civil government of the provinces was to be reorganized into new units called 'départements', originally intended to be 83 or 84 in number. The dioceses of the Roman Catholic Church were to be reduced in number, to coincide as much as possible with the new departments. Since there were more than 130 bishoprics at the time of the Revolution, more than fifty dioceses needed to be suppressed and their territories consolidated. Clergy would need to take an oath of allegiance to the State and its Constitution, specified by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, and they would become salaried officials of the State. Both bishops and priests would be elected by special 'electors' in each department. This meant schism, since bishops would no longer need to be approved (preconised) by the Papacy; the transfer of bishops, likewise, which had formerly been the exclusive prerogative of the pope in canon law, would be the privilege of the State; the election of bishops no longer lay with the Cathedral Chapters (which were all abolished), or other responsible clergy, or the Pope, but with electors who did not even have to be Catholics or Christians. All monasteries, convents and religious orders in France were dissolved, and their members were released from their vows by order of the National Constituent Assembly (which was uncanonical); their property was confiscated ""for the public good"", and sold to pay the bills of the French government. Cathedral Chapters were also dissolved.Philippe Bourdin, ""Collégiales et chapitres cathédraux au crible de l'opinion et de la Révolution,""  Annales historiques de la Révolution française no. 331 (janvier/mars 2003), 29-55, at 29-30, 52-53.

The diocese of Gap and the diocese of Embrun were suppressed by the Legislative Assembly, and the territories combined into a new diocese, Hautes-Alpes, with its seat at Gap. A new bishop, to replace Bishop La Broue de Vareilles, whose seat was declared vacant since he had refused to take the oath to the Civil Constitution, was to be elected.  Ignace de Cazeneuve, a Canon of the Cathedral Chapter of Gap, was elected by special Electors in March 1791, and was consecrated in Paris on 3 April by Constitutional Bishop Jean-Baptiste Gobel. He ceased functioning after 1793, and resigned on 1 June 1798. Fr. André Garnier was named bishop in succession to Cazeneuve by the Metropolitan, Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Aubert, and was consecrated in Aix on 19 January 1800. He resigned in 1801.

In 1799, Pope Pius VI, made a prisoner by order of the Directory, was being transported from Florence to Valence, he passed through Gap on 29 June and bestowed his blessing on the crowds which had gathered to see him. He spent the night in Gap, and received some of the local notables. The Pope died in prison in Valence on 29 August 1799.Fisquet, pp. 14–15.

The diocese of Gap and the diocese of Embrun were legally suppressed by the Concordat of 1801 between First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte and Pope Pius VII.  In the Bull Qui Christi Domini of 29 November 1801,Bull Qui Christi Domini, in Bullarii romani continuatio, Vol. XI, Rome 1845, pp. 245–249 the departments of Hautes-Alpes and of Basses-Alpes were united in a single diocese with its seat at Digne.P. Guillaume, in: L'épiscopat français..., pp. 250–251. Other territories were reassigned to the restored Diocese of Avignon, Diocese of Grenoble and Diocese of Valence.Fisquet, p. 17.

The diocese of Gap was re-established at least in theory by the Concordat of 1817 between King Louis XVIII and Pope Pius VII, but its implementation was delayed by the refusal of the Chamber of Deputies to ratify the treaty. There was no diocese of Gap between 1801 and 1822. The diocese was actually restored on 6 (or 10) October 1822, comprising, besides the ancient diocese of Gap, a large part of the ancient Archdiocese of Embrun.Fisquet, p. 18.  The diocese of Gap was made a suffragan of the archdiocese of Aix. The name of the Metropolitan see of Embrun had been absorbed in the title of the Archbishop of Aix-en-Provence and Arles until 2007. In 2008, the title was reattached to the Diocese of Gap by a decision of the Congregation of Bishops, conveyed in a letter of Cardinal Giovanni Battista Ré, the Prefect.Letter of Cardinal Ré on the Diocese of Gap website The diocese was divided into two Archdeaconries: Saint-Arnoux and Notre-Dame-d'Embrun. The Major Seminary was at Gap, and the Minor Seminary at Embrun.Fisquet, p. 18. In 2017, there is no longer a diocesan seminary; students for the priesthood are sent to the Diocesan Seminary of Saint-Luc d'Aix en Provence.Guide diocesain 2016, p. 38; retrieved: 2017-07-23.

In 1947 it gained territory from Metropolitan Archdiocese of Torino (Turin, in Piemonte, Italy).

Cathedral and Chapter

The Cathedral of the Assumption of Notre-Dame was served by a chapter composed of four dignities (dignités; not dignitaries): the dean, the archdeacon, the provost, and the sacristan. There were in addition nine canons (one of whom was called the Canon Theological and another Capiscol.Fisquet,, pp. 15–16. Gap was unique among the churches of Province, in that its Cathedral Chapter was not headed by its provost, but by its dean.Albanés, pp. 545–546. In 2017, there was a Dean and ten Canons.

710,20273,5305929,20673,Palestinian General Federation of Trade Unions,"The Palestinian General Federation of Trade Unions (PGFTU), also called the Palestine General Federation of Trade Unions or Palestinian Trade Union Federation (and, briefly, General Trade Union Federation in Palestine), is a national trade union center in the Palestinian Territories. It has an estimated membership of 290,000, and is affiliated with the International Trade Union Confederation. The union in its current form is historically aligned with Fatah, but other parties have also worked within its organization.""Palestinian union hit on all sides"", al-Jazeera, 14 July 2007, 04:26, http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2007/07/2008525172856148863.html.

The PGFTU traces its modern history to 1965, and its origins to the Palestinian labour movement of the 1920s. Its current general secretary is Shaher Saed, who has held the position for many years. The PGFTU has not held open elections since 1981,Joost R. Hiltermann. ""Mass Mobilization under Occupation: The Emerging Trade Union Movement in the West Bank""; MERIP Reports, No. 136/137, West Bank, Gaza, Israel: Marching toward Civil War (Oct. - Dec., 1985), pp. 26-31Joost R.

""Anything but Workers in the Palestinian Trade Unions""; News from Within, April, 1996""Palestinian Workers Claim Their Rights in Gaza Amidst Violence and Political Chaos"" ; AdvocacyNet News Bulletin 94, March 29, 2007

A 2007 report in al-Jazeera indicates that the PGFTU receives most of its funding from Saudi Arabia, Syria and Egypt, as well as from organisations such as the Red Cross. Saed argues in the same report that his union has aided more than 250,000 Palestinians with both work and financial support.""Palestinian union hit on all sides"", al-Jazeera, 14 July 2007, 04:26.

History

Early years and the First Intifada

The early years of the PGFTU were marked by fragmentation and political division. As'ad Ghanem has written that the West Bank General Federation definitively seceded from its parent Jordanian body in 1969. A new General Federation of Palestinian Labour Unions was established in 1973, due in large part to the efforts of the Communist Party, but it was not particularly successful and split into rival factions in 1981. After this period, unions aligned with Fatah, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and Communists all claimed the name ""General Federation"" for themselves. There were also regional divisions, as separate union organizations developed in the West Bank, Gaza, and around the exiled leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).As'ad Ghanem, The Palestinian Regime: A ""Partial Democracy"", pp. 39-40.

Ghanem has argued that these rival ""General Federations"" did not function as effective labour unions during this period, and that internal elections came to an end after 1981. This situation continued into the period of the First Intifada, and several rival groups were still claiming the name ""General Federation"" in the period just before the Gulf War.Nina Sovich, ""Stifling Democracy Within Palestinian Unions"", Middle East Report, Summer 2000, pp. 2-3;Sos Nissen, ""Anything but Workers in the Palestinian Trade Unions"", News From Within, Alternative Information Center, April 1996, accessed 28 June 2008.

A movement toward unity began in 1990, as federations aligned with the Palestinian People's Party (formerly Communists) and Popular Front merged with the Fatah-aligned group. The Democratic Front joined at the end of 1993. Fatah emerged as the dominant force within the union after the merger.Nissen, ""Anything but Workers"".

In September 1990, the West Bank federation reported that 8,500 Palestinians, who were either expelled from the Gulf States or left because their work contracts were not renewed, had crossed into the West Bank from Jordan since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait the previous month. (Many Palestinian workers faced discrimination in Gulf countries in this period, after the PLO declared its support for the invasion.) Shaher Saed, described as the federation's General Secretary, complained that the problem of finding employment for these workers was compounded by the growing number of Palestinians who had lost their jobs to recent immigrants from the Soviet Union to Israel. He called for economists to develop constructive projects within Palestine, and for Palestinian workers to be allowed to return to the Gulf States. The federation reaffirmed its support for the PLO in the same period.Jon Immanuel, ""Palestinian Plight Worsens as Gulf State Expulsions Rise"", Jerusalem Post, 1990-09-11. 02. When the Gulf War began in January 1991, Sa'ad complained that many Palestinian workers were unable to purchase food due to Israeli curfews that prevented them from reaching their workplaces.Curtis Wilkie, ""Iraqi Scuds, Israeli curfew deepen rifts of intifadah"", Boston Globe, 28 January 1991.

Oslo process
Saed endorsed the Oslo Peace Process in 1993, and sent a public letter condemning violence and terror to Haim Haberfield, secretary-general of the Israeli Histadrut. In the same letter, Saed also called for Israel to return tax and pension money taken from workers in the occupied territories, which he said amounted to $27 billion. In response, Haberfield indicated that he too supported the peace process and called for an end to regional violence.""Palestinian Unionist Condemns Slayings"", Jerusalem Post, 28 October 1993, 14.

The return of the exiled Palestinian leadership to the West Bank and Gaza after the signing of the Oslo Accords brought about a change in the PGFTU's structure. Shaher Saed was confirmed as its General Secretary and led its operations in the West Bank, while Rasem Biyari became its second-in-command and oversaw operations in Gaza. Nina Sovich has argued that the PGFTU was unable to develop an effective internal organization after this period, and was hindered by a rivalry between Saed and Haidar Ibrahim, the general secretary of the General Union of Palestinian Workers.Sovich further argues that this rivalry reflected a more fundamental division in Palestinian society, between figures like Ibrahim who spent the Intifada years in exile, and those like Saed who operated from the West Bank and Gaza. See Sovich, ""Palestinian trade unions"", pp. 68-69.

The PGFTU and Histadrut reached a number of agreements during the Oslo years. In November 1994, the Histadrut agreed to transfer $6–7 million (NIS) to Palestinian unions in Gaza and the West Bank over two years.Michael Yudelman, ""Histadrut signs accord with Arab union"", Jerusalem Post, 14 November 1994, 02. In February 1997, the Histadrut and PGFTU signed an agreement to allow Palestinian workers to sue in Israeli courts for income losses caused by closures.""Histadrut signs pact with Palestinian union"", Jerusalem Post, 21 February 1997, 02. Similar arrangements were agreed to on other occasions. In 2000, Nina Sovich wrote an article arguing that the PGFTU had not succeeded in protecting the rights of Palestinian workers in Israel.Nina Sovich, ""Palestinian Trade Unions"", Journal of Palestine Studies, Autumn 2000, p. 66.

The PGFTU organized a protest against an extended Israeli blockade on Gaza in early 1996, arguing that it was unfairly targeting Palestinian workers.Ibrahim Barzak, ""Palestinians Protest Closure; Israel Says it Will Ease Blockade"", Associated Press, 16 March 1996. When the Israeli borders were closed again in late 1996 following an outbreak of violence, the PGFTU reported that the resulting unemployment had reached 55% in the West Bank and 70% in Gaza.""EXPERTS GIVE DETAILS OF IMPACT OF CLOSURE ON PALESTINIAN ECONOMY"", BBC Monitoring Service: Middle East, 15 October 1996.

Post-Oslo

Conflict with Israel

The PGFTU staged a sit-in at the Ain al-Hilweh refugee camp in February 2001, after the breakdown of the Oslo process, to promote the right of Palestinian refugees to return to Israel.""Camps show no preference between Barak, Sharon"", Daily Star, 7 February 2001. In January of the following year, Saed called on the European Union to stop importing goods from Israel until its forces withdrew from the Palestinian territories.David Cronon, ""Palestinian union boss calls for halt to Israeli imports until forces withdraw"", European Voice, 24 January 2002. A subsequent report from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions indicated that the federation's normal union activities were again suspended due to ongoing violence, and that the PGFTU was focusing its efforts on job creation strategies and providing assistance to the poor.""Union rights in the Middle East - ICFTU paints gloomy picture"", Al-Bawaba News, 23 June 2002.

In September 2002, the PGFTU accused the Israeli army of executing four Palestinian workers without provocation outside a Hebron settlement. The army said the men had intended to attack the settlement.""Union says army killed Palestinian ""workers"" in cold-blood"", Agence France-Presse, 1 September 2002. In November 2002, a representative of the PGFTU accused the Israeli government of uprooting thousands of Palestinian-owned olive trees to make way for its separation wall between Israel and the West Bank,Mark Heinrich, ""Israel probing fate of Palestinian olive trees"", Reuters News, 26 November 2002, 11:14. which the federation later estimated could cost 52,000 Palestinian jobs.Jonathan Fowler, ""Israeli barrier could cost 52,000 Palestinian jobs: Palestinian officials"", Associated Press, 9 June 2004, 09:34. In 2005, the PGFTU called for the international community to engage in a campaign of Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions against Israel.""Case for a boycott"", Morning Star Online, 29 June 2007.

The PGFTU strongly condemned Israel's military actions in Gaza and Lebanon in 2006.""Concern at escalation in Gaza, Lebanon, Israel"", Public Service International, 18 July 2006, 17:19. Two years later, the federation called for an international boycott of celebrations commemorating Israel's sixtieth anniversary.""Palestinian Appeal to International Civil Society: Boycott the ""Israel at 60"" Celebrations!"", Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, May/June 2008, p. 39.

A division of the Israeli army broke into the PGFTU's Ramallah office on July 4, 2007. Shaher Saed subsequently informed al-Jazeera that he had not been informed of the reasons for the raid, and complained that several filing cabinets and computers had been destroyed. Israeli authorities said that the raid had taken place ""in order to protect the citizens of Israel"", and denied that equipment was damaged.

Work with the Histadrut

The PGFTU sent a letter to the leader of the Histradrut in April 2007, arguing that both unions ""must emphasise our mutual need for peace in our two societies, for the benefit both of workers and because peace will reflect stability"". This occurred against the backdrop of improved conditions between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, following a split between the governments of the West Bank and Gaza.Roger Lyons, ""Israeli boycotts: gesture politics or a moral imperative?"", The Guardian, 21 April 2007, 33.

Condemnation of 9/11

The PGFTU condemned the terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington on September 11, 2001. Saed described the attacks as an ""action against humanity and peace"", and gave his ""condolences to the American people and their families, the victims of this cowardly and shocking event.""John Parker, ""Condolences"", Traffic World, 24 September 2001.

Conflict with Hamas

The PFGTU became a target in the conflict between Fatah and Hamas in Gaza in early 2007. Rasem Biyari's Gaza home was hit by a rocket attack in January 2007,""Gaza: Assassination Attempt on Union Leader"", International Trade Union Federation, 29 January 2007, 15:25. and Shaher Saed later told al-Jazeera that Hamas had made three assassination attempts against Biyari during the conflict.

Hamas-aligned militants occupied the PGFTU's Gaza headquarters in July 2007, removed all of the existing slogans and flags, and raised a Hamas flag over the building. According to a statement issued by the PGFTU, the militants then ordered the union's staff to discuss how they were going to operate under Hamas rule. Saed called for Hamas to return the building to PGFTU control, and expressed concern that the conflict could prevent 200,000 workers from receiving health insurance benefits.""Egyptian security envoy says no winners in Palestinian infighting"", BBC Monitoring Middle East, 2 February 2007, 09:29; ""Palestinian Executive Force storms trade union federation HQ"", BBC Monitoring Middle East, 9 July 2007, 5:01.

Azzam Tamimi of the London-based Institute of Islamic Political Thought questioned the legitimacy of Sa'ad's remarks in a 2007 interview, describing them as part of a ""propaganda war"" between Hamas and Fatah. He said, ""The PGFTU is a Fatah organisation ... Fatah, in the West Bank, has been destroying offices of Hamas. Now, Fatah is trying to say that Hamas is trying to do exactly the same in Gaza. Which from my sources, seems to be untrue."" Saed himself was briefly taken prisoner by militants aligned with Fatah in 2007, and was accused of supporting Hamas. A Fatah politician later said that the incident was a mistake, and that Sa'ad had received an apology.See Palestinian union hit on all sides, al-Jazeera, 14 July 2007, 04:26.

In March 2008, the five-story Gaza headquarters of the PGFTU were destroyed by F-16 missiles in an Israeli air raid.Mohammed Omer, ""Trade union building targeted in Gaza"", Electronic Intifada, 4 March 2008, accessed 28 June 2008.

Criticism

The PGFTU has been heavily criticized by insiders such as Muhammad Al-Arouri,Nina Sovich. ""Palestinian Trade Unions""; Journal of Palestine Studies, Vol. 29, No. 4 (Autumn, 2000), pp. 66-79 former head of the PGFTU legislative unit until his dismissal in 2005. The head of the GFTU in 1982, Mahmud Ziyada—a friend of Al-Arouri and a unionist imprisoned for a total of four years during the Israeli crackdown on trade unions around the time of the First Intifada—resigned in protest over the lack of democratic elections; (today Ziyada is with the Democracy and Workers' Rights Center). Bassim Khoury of the Palestinian Authority raised similar concerns over the failure of the PGFTU to represent workers, decades later in 2007.

Since 1993, independent unionists at the Democracy and Workers' Rights Center (DWRC) have asserted that many Palestinian workers regard the PGFTU as too closely aligned with Fatah and lacking in internal democracy and transparency. In a 2007 press release carried by the Advocacy Project, the DWRC noted that internal elections had not been held in decades.Independent Palestinian Unions Establish New Coalition in Drive for Worker Democracy, July 31, 2007 , accessed 28 June 2008. These critiques have been supported by scholars Joost Hiltermann, Nina SovichNina Sovich. ""Stifling Democracy within Palestinian Unions""; Middle East Report, No. 215 (Summer, 2000), pp. 2-3 and Sos Nissen, who argue that the PGFTU has long been dominated by political factions and has in turn failed to provide effective representation for workers.

Through independent labor activists' and DWRC's efforts, hundreds of independent workers' committees have conjoined into the Independent Workers' Committees Federation since 2004. In 2005 the PGFTU sent a letter to the International Federation of Workers' Education Associations (IFWEA) charging that DWRC's Gaza head Mohammad Dahman ""obtains funds from Norway and the Europeans and was arrested by the [Palestinian] Authority several times because of subversion against the [Palestinian] Authority and its leaders,"" and furthermore alleging that ""the so-called Independent Workers' Committees are coordinating with the Democracy and Workers' Rights Center headed by Mohammed Dahman2[ii] as well as Hamas movement and the Palestinian National Initiative headed by Mustafa Barghouthi."" Such charges, which could lead to Dahman's imprisonment, were heavily contested by DWRC.IFWEA archive - Dispute between the Independent Workers' Committees Federation and the PGFTU

In 2007 building criticism of the PGTFU culminated in the creation of the Federation of Independent & Democratic Trade Unions & Workers' Committees in Palestine, representing over 50,000 male and female workers in independent, democratically elected unions and workers' committees across the West Bank and Gaza.""Establishing Conference for the Coalition of Independent and Democratic Trade Unions & Workers' Committees in Palestine July 25, 2007"" ; Advocacynet, July 25, 2007 Mohammad Al-Arouri, formerly of the PGFTU, is a main coordinator of the new federation.""Unemployed workers demonstrate against poverty"" Stand Up, Take Action - UNDP site, October 17, 2007""Statements in Occasion of Workers' Boycott Call""; Stop the Wall Campaign, February 11, 2007

 Background 
The derailment occurred in the backdrop of an ""alarming"" number of derailments in 2023 in the United States.

Shortly after the derailment, the town of Livingston was evacuated. The governor of Kentucky declared a state of emergency in the entire surroundings of Rockcastle County in connection of the derailment and the chemicals, but was lifted several hours later.

A total of 15 out of the 40 cars of the train derailed, and at least only two were breached. The train spilled burning molten sulfur chemicals that created a large plumes of smoke. The derailment occurred near both Roundstone Creek and Ten Foot Hole Road, which is part of the Roundstone watershed. The chemicals released were suspected to include sulfur dioxide, which is harmful in high concentrations and as a background pollutant.

One day, their schoolmate, Nirvana (Agot Isidro) organizes a high school reunion. She went to a place where Becky and Badette reside to invite them to their reunion as their batchmates hadn't heard any update from them. Nirvana tells them they will receive an award from their alma mater and will wear colorful outfits. The batch expects them to be successful because their principal has said that they are the ones who are likely to succeed.

Becky and Badette go to the reunion. They are wearing colorful outfits, which are costumes from the bar beneath their boarding house. The whole batch ridicules them for their outfit, and worse, they ridicule them when Nirvana gives awards to every batchmate, except them. So they resort to drinking and get drunk.

While drunk, they reveal to the batch over the microphone that they are actually lovers. Their revelation is recorded on video and the video goes viral. This viral video becomes their gateway to their fame... and downfall.

The film tells of a group of criminals who must team up with each other to fight for their lives when a top-secret underworld trading post comes under attack by bloodthirsty hitmen.

The film has been marketed as the ""most violent film of Finland"". Film director Jussila has said that his film is ""a mixture of two film genres, action films with extreme horror, been practically one big love letter not only to genre classics, but also to exploitation films that could be found in the more dubious corners of video rental shops and on the prohibited lists of the film inspectorate."" According to Jussila, who has become known in underground culture for his smaller cult films, like Goremageddon (2011), Goremadeddon 2 (2017) and The Pussy with an Uzi (2021), Prisons is his most ambitious directing work. In his opinion, the film is exceptional in Finland due to its violence, effects and stunt choreography performed by the actors.

The film premiered on 9 February 2024.

726,11806,5286022,9439,Superman (comic strip),"Superman was a daily newspaper comic strip which began on January 16, 1939, and a separate Sunday strip was added on November 5, 1939. These strips ran continuously until May 1966. In 1941, the McClure Syndicate had placed the strip in hundreds of newspapers.  At its peak, the strip, featuring Superman, was in over 300 daily newspapers and 90 Sunday papers, with a readership of over 20 million. A spin-off, Lois Lane, Girl Reporter, ran irregularly between 1943 and 1944.

During the National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications court case, the District Court ruled that McClure Syndicate failed to place the copyright notice on some of the strips and thus those strips are in the public domain.

Original storylines

The daily strip was host to many storylines, unique from the regular Superman comic series. The early years consisted of Siegel-era Superman stories, many of which have yet to be republished. The strips contained the first appearance of a bald Lex Luthor, the first appearance of Mr. Mxyzptlk and of Superman's parents Jor-El and Lara. It also included the first instance in comics of Superman changing costume in a telephone booth. Other stories of note include Superman saving Santa Claus from the Nazis, World War II-era stories of Superman protecting the American home front, and Clark Kent marrying Lois Lane. The artwork includes runs by famed Superman artists Wayne Boring and Curt Swan.

Mr. Mxyzptlk was not created for, but first published in the Superman daily strip. The character was first created to appear in the story ""The Mysterious Mr. Mxyztplk"" written by Jerry Siegel and drawn by Ira Yarborough. Due to the publishing lag time, the daily strip team of writer Whitney Ellsworth and artist Wayne Boring saw the character and were able to use him first in the daily strip story ""The Mischievous Mr. Mxyzptlk"" published from February 21 to July 19, 1944. ""The Mysterious Mr. Mxyzptlk"" was published the comic book Superman #30 in September 1944.

Superman appeared in the newspapers again in 1978, with the newspaper strip The World's Greatest Superheroes, which was retitled in his name in 1982 and lasted until 1985. Between these two comic strip series, Superman appeared in almost 12,000 unique newspaper strips.

Writers and artists

Over the years, there have been a number of different writers and artists on the Superman newspaper strips. Originally, the strip was drawn by Joe Shuster. As Superman became more and more popular and the workload kept increasing, Shuster turned over many duties to his studio assistants. Paul Cassidy was the first in a line of ghost artists on the strip and took over the inking and detail work in 1939. In September 1940, Leo Nowak replaced Cassidy on the strip. Other assistants during this time included Dennis Neville, John Sikela (beginning in 1940), Ed Dobrotka (beginning in 1941), Paul J. Lauretta, and Jack Burnley (beginning in 1941). Sikela and Dobrotka often traded penciling and inking duties between each other. Lauretta primarily inked and did backgrounds on the strips. Burnley eventually left to work on his own comic book, Starman, but did return to pencil the Superman Sundays in 1943. The Superman strips during this early period of shop work was a team effort with multiple artists working on different parts of the same strip.

This early period ended with the start of World War II. Jerry Siegel, the main writer, was drafted in 1943. Early that same year, Leo Nowak and John Sikela were drafted as well. In 1943, Stan Kaye took over the inking. Wayne Boring, who had been another early assistant to Joe Shuster, left the Shuster studio in 1942 to directly draw the daily strip for DC. Boring and Kaye dominated the daily strip's artwork throughout most of the 1940s. The two also provided art for the Sunday strip between 1940 and 1966.

In the middle of 1949, Win Mortimer took over the daily strip from Boring. Stan Kaye continued inking Mortimer's work until Kaye temporarily left, and Mortimer inked his own work until he left DC in 1956 to publish his David Crane strip. Curt Swan took over the daily strip on June 18, 1956, along with Stan Kaye. Swan continued on the strip until November 12, 1960.

As for the stories in the Superman strips, Jerry Siegel originally wrote them until he was drafted in 1943.  Whitney Ellsworth, who had begun on the strip in 1941, continued until 1945. Jack Schiff began his writing on the strip in 1942 and worked on the strip off and on until 1962.

Alvin Schwartz first started writing for the Superman strip in October 1944. Between 1947 and 1951, Schwartz was the only writer on the Superman strip, and he continued on the strip until 1958. Bill Woolfolk wrote one story for the dailies in 1953.

In 1959, Bill Finger started scripting stories, and he worked through the series' end in 1966. During this final period, Jerry Siegel resumed his duties writing some stories.

Spin-off
McClure Syndicate, concerned and fearing newspapers would cancel the popular Superman strip if it could not appear regularly and on time, appealed to DC to instead create a spin-off strip, Lois Lane, Girl Reporter, for McClure to use as a filler material for newspaper syndication. Lois Lane accompanied the Superman Sunday strip in the Cleveland Plain Dealer, running irregularly between October 24, 1943, and February 27, 1944; a total of twelve Lois Lane topper strips were produced.

Reprints
In 2013, The Library of American Comics started to collect all the Superman comic strips, daily and Sundays, originally published between 1943 and 1966, so far producing thirteen volumes of hardcover collections; Kitchen Sink Press and later Sterling Publishing had already already published the 1939-1942 years in two hardcover books, one each for the Sundays and the dailies.

As of 2024, no imprint has yet to publish the Superman daily strips from 1949-1959 as no complete set of viable proofs, or private collections, of those years can be found. If and when found, this run would likely require another three or four additional volumes to be produced.",2025-03-03,"['1939 comics debuts' '1966 comics endings'

731,3367,75074572,16661,Brian Merrett,"Brian Jackson Merrett (July 28, 1945 – September 21, 2023) was a Canadian photographer and architectural activist known for his contributions to the preservation of Montreal's architectural heritage. Through his photographs and actions toward saving threatened buildings, he played an important role in the preservation of Montreal's historic structures, including the Shaughnessy House, which later became the Canadian Centre for Architecture, and the Windsor Station. He was one of the founding members of Heritage Montreal, a Canadian non-profit conservation organization.

 Early life 
Merrett was born on July 28, 1945, in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada. His father, John Campbell Merrett, was an architect and town planner whose work included the Art Deco–styled interior of the Central Station in Montreal. Merrett grew up in Senneville, a suburb of Montreal. He was introduced to photography at an early age, when he won a 35 mm camera in a contest when he was 12. By his late teens, he was processing and working with black-and-white film. Speaking later of his architect father's role in shaping his interest for photography, Merrett would say, ""His eyes shaped mine"".

 Career and activism 
Merrett started his career working as an architectural draftsman before moving over to photography in the 1960s. He started his photography career, training under Lennart Koraen, a commercial photographer. During this time he focused on urban architectural projects. Amongst some of his major works during this period was the 1969 commissioned photography of the restoration of the Bank of Montreal that he did for his father's architectural firm.

During the 1970s, Montreal faced rampant destruction of its historic buildings. The city was coming off the Quiet Revolution and the October Crisis, both bringing along social and cultural upheaval. Brian Merrett became actively involved in various organizations aimed at preserving the city's architectural heritage from large-scale urban infrastructure projects. Some of his popular series from the time included Autoroute Ville-Marie (1969–1972) and In and Around Windsor Station (1972). He played a crucial role in saving the Shaughnessy House, a historic building that once belonged to Canada's railway baron family, was at risk of demolition. His compelling photographs in 1973,https://www.cca.qc.ca/en/search/details/library/publication/80130175 of the building's interior convinced Phyllis Lambert, a prominent architect and advocate for architectural causes, to purchase the Shaughnessy mansion in 1974 and transform it into the Canadian Centre for Architecture (CCA). Merrett also worked on campaigns to save other landmarks, including Windsor Station and the Van Horne Mansion. While the Van Horne Mansion was not preserved, it served as a galvanizing force bringing together multiple citizens' groups to preserve the city's heritage. Merrett's work during this period documented threatened buildings and played a crucial role in their preservation. He served as an advocate for preserving older buildings and was a dedicated environmentalist. Earlier in 1972, he had spent more than two months on a photography expedition through Europe with his then wife, Jennifer Harper. The photographs from the period were exhibited as Holiday Pictures of Europe/L’Europe en vacances (1972). The tour was intended to be a grand tour, however, his work stood out for bringing out the odds that modernization was at with urban preservation. He continued to remain active into the 2020 working on an effort to drive awareness to save the 169-year-old Fulford Residence in Montreal from demolition in 2021. The building was later designated as a heritage site and subsequently preserved,  a fitting posthumous conservation project resulting from Merrett's photography, combining architectural heritage with social purpose.https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/allison-hanes-happy-ending-for-fulford-residence-as-chez-doris-acquires-landmark

Merrett captured photographs for many organizations including Westmount Action Committee, Heritage Montreal, and SOS Montreal. He was also one of the founding members of Heritage Montreal, a Canadian non-profit conservation organization, and its predecessor organization Save Montreal. In his activism focused on urbanism and preservation of heritage buildings, Merrett was among a group of photographer activists that included Clara Gutsche, Melvin Charney, and David Miller.

Through his career, Merrett published several books, collaborating with Dane Lanken and, extensively, François Rémillard, that focused on Montreal's heritage architecture. He also served as the staff photographer at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts between 1983 and 2001. Merrett donated a portion of his photographic archive to the McCord Museum to preserve his decade-long documentation of Montreal's past. The donation consists of roughly 40,000 negatives, most of which have never been printed or publicly exhibited.https://www.musee-mccord-stewart.ca/en/blog/brian-merrett-presence-past/ These negatives capture a meticulous record of Montreal's evolution, featuring elements that are now lost or significantly altered, and serve as a record of Montreal's transformation over the years.

 Personal life 
Merrett married Jennifer Harper, also a photographer and daughter of J. Russell Harper, in the 1970s and had a son and a daughter, Toby and Hannah Harper-Merrett. The couple divorced and Merrett later married Lucinda Lyman who had two children from an earlier marriage. In his later years, Merrett spent his time in Montreal and North Hatley, Quebec, often with his grandchildren, and where he actively participated in local causes including activism against a condo development. He was also a member of the Strategic Planning Committee of North Hatley.

Merrett died on September 21, 2023,https://www.ledevoir.com/culture/798928/1945-2023-photographe-brian-merrett-est-eteint at his home in North Hatley. He had been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and had lost his ability to speak. He was 78.

Merrett was memorialised in publications by the institutions he was associated with, as well as local and nationalhttps://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-photographer-brian-merrett-fought-to-preserve-montreals-architectural/ media, and in a statement in the House of Commons of Canada the 8th of November, 2023, by Member of Parliament Anna Gainey.https://parlvu.parl.gc.ca/Harmony/en/PowerBrowser/PowerBrowserV2/20231108/-1/40219?mediaStartTime=20231108140840&mediaEndTime=20231108140957&viewMode=3&globalStreamId=31

732,34281,75966485,100233,Timeline of the 1993 Pacific hurricane season,"The 1993 Pacific hurricane season consisted of the events that occurred in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation over the Pacific Ocean north of the Equator and east of the International Date Line. The official bounds of each Pacific hurricane season are dates that conventionally delimit the period each year during which tropical cyclones tend to form in the basin according to the National Hurricane Center, beginning on May 15 in the Eastern Pacific proper (east of 140°W) and on June 1 in the Central Pacific (140°W to the International Date Line), and ending on November 30 in both areas. However, tropical cyclogenesis is possible at any time of the year. The first system, Hurricane Adrian, developed on June 11; the final system, Tropical Depression , dissipated on October 14.

A total of eighteen tropical depressions formed during the season; fifteen of these developed into named tropical storms, of which eleven became hurricanes and nine became major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson scale). The number of tropical storms was near the long-term average; the number of hurricanes was slightly above average, and the number of major hurricanes was more than double the average of four. As with many active Pacific hurricane seasons, El Niño conditions greatly influenced this season's high activity levels. Several long-lived and powerful hurricanes contributed to an overall Accumulated Cyclone Energy value of 201.8 units, the eighth-highest on record for a Pacific hurricane season as of February 2024.

The most impactful storm of the season was Hurricane Calvin, which made landfall near Manzanillo in the Mexican state of Colima as a Category 2 hurricane; it killed more than 30 people, mainly due to significant flooding, and damages amounted to $32 million (1993 USD). Two months later, Hurricane Lidia came ashore at a similar intensity farther to the northwest along the coast of Sinaloa, where it caused considerable damage and multiple fatalities. In conjunction with a cold front, Lidia's remnants generated severe weather in Texas, including a tornado that caused $8 million (1993 USD) in damage. Earlier in the season, Tropical Storm Beatriz killed 6 people in Mexico when it struck the southern portion of the country, while Tropical Depression  produced heavy rainfall that amounted to nearly a foot (12 in; 30.48 cm) in Acapulco despite remaining offshore. Hurricane Hilary made three landfalls in Mexico – twice on the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, and then on the Mexican mainland as a tropical depression – but caused no loss of life and little damage. Hurricanes Dora, Eugene, and Fernanda produced minor impacts in Hawaii; Eugene made landfall on the Big Island as a tropical depression, while Fernanda prompted the issuance of a hurricane warning, though this was discontinued when the storm turned away.

Prior to 2015, two time zones were utilized in the Eastern Pacific basin: Pacific east of 140°W, and Hawaii−Aleutian from 140°W to the International Date Line. For convenience, each event is listed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) first, using the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight UTC), with the respective local time included in parentheses. Figures for maximum sustained winds and position estimates are rounded to the nearest five units (knots, miles, or kilometers) and averaged over one minute, following National Hurricane Center practice. Direct wind observations are rounded to the nearest whole number. Atmospheric pressures are listed to the nearest millibar and nearest hundredth of an inch of mercury. This timeline documents the formation of tropical cyclones as well as the strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released while the storm was active, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center is included.

733,59184,76704932,22874,Loom (Imagine Dragons album),"Loom is the sixth studio album by American pop rock band Imagine Dragons, released through Kidinakorner and Interscope Records on June 28, 2024. The standard version comprises nine tracks, the fewest on an Imagine Dragons album to date. Produced by the band and longtime collaborators Mattman & Robin, it follows their two-part studio album Mercury – Acts 1 & 2 (2022). The album marks the band's first release as a trio, due to drummer Daniel Platzman announcing an indefinite hiatus from the band in March 2023, later departing from the band in August 2024.

The album received generally positive reviews from music critics, and peaked at number 22 on the US Billboard 200.

 Background and concept 
In an interview with the Associated Press, lead singer Dan Reynolds described the creative process behind the album and its cover:

 Singles and promotion 

On March 10, 2024, the band began teasing new music on their social media. In the following days, a sand clock was displayed on the official website. By the end of March, the website started showing four doors. The four doors consisted on three different groups competing to get points on multiple mini games; the three groups were Croyants (Believers), Guerriers (Warriors) and Rêveurs (Dreamers), divided according to previous music preference of the users. Each of these groups were referencing a song from the band: ""Believer"", ""Warriors"" and ""Dream"".

Each week, a new door was revealed, showing a new game and some clues about the release date or some of the new songs' lyrics. On April 1, with the opening of the second door, they announced a new song titled ""Eyes Closed"" would be released on April 3. On April 22, after all four doors were opened, a fifth door –referencing the ""Eyes Closed"" music video– was revealed, which finally confirmed the new album's name to be Loom. Additionally, a new world tour was announced to begin during the summer.

For the winning team of the four doors, the Croyants, a video was shared with snippets for three songs from the new album, titled: ""Fire in These Hills"", ""Nice to Meet You"" and ""Wake Up"".

On April 25, a post on social media from the band's official accounts teased a new collaboration. On April 30, their official account announced a new version of ""Eyes Closed"" featuring Colombian singer J Balvin. It was released on May 3.

The official track list, along with the song lengths, were unveiled on May 8.

A second single ""Nice to Meet You"" was released on May 24.

The band released a music video for ""Wake Up"" on July 2.

A remix of ""Take Me to the Beach"" featuring Baker Boy was released on October 11.  Another featuring Ernia was released on October 18. A third remix with Jungeli was released on November 1, followed by a fourth with Ado on December 16.

Critical reception

Loom received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 67, based on 4 reviews, which indicates ""generally favorable reviews"". This is the first time one of the band's albums received a positive score.

Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic gave the album a positive review, stating ""longtime fans of their aggressive empowerment anthems will delight in this pseudo-'return to form' from the Vegas quartet"" and described it as ""one of their most satisfying and immediate sets to date"". Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone said that the album ""finds the band piloting some musical and personal transitions"" and later concluding that ""Such kind-vibes moments show that within the vast spaces these guys work in, there's always room for growth"". Tom Carr of The Arts Desk remarked that ""[Loom] may not be challenging to listen to, but it can't be denied that Imagine Dragons have a knack for bringing together various textures, and condensing them into something that goes down smooth"" and said that ""Overall, Loom pleases without blazing any new trails"". Robin Murray of Clash gave the album a mixed review, summarizing that it was a ""succinct if somewhat unfulfilling return"".

 Commercial performance 
Loom debuted at number 22 on the US Billboard 200 with 28,000 album-equivalent units. It is the band's first album to not peak in the top ten of the chart, as well as their first to not have a song chart on the Billboard Hot 100.

Mark Deming of AllMusic found it to be similar to Acoustic Space in that it is ""built around the percussion of Burnett's longtime associate Jay Bellerose and the clouds of sound conjured by keyboardist Keefus Ciancia, generating slowly roiling sonic backdrops of rhythm and carefully sculpted noise, with Burnett chanting his verse over it all"". Lee Zimmerman of American Songwriter said that it ""veers sharply"" from Acoustic Space as it ""consists almost entirely of songs marked by didactic rhythms and ominous overtones"" and a ""heady fusion of trance, electronica, tribal and global music"".

PopMatters Steve Horowitz wrote that ""Burnett and company go high tech to attack high tech"" as ""the lyrics offer whip-smart criticisms of technology and its users"" and ""the instrumentation and arrangements can be primal, martial, or formal then mixed with more contemporary electronic effects"". Shawn Donohue of Glide Magazine commented that Burnett ""continu[es] his avant-garde style, furthering his sense of desolation, end of times despair, and unflinching pessimism"" with an album that ""feels as if it was sonically inspired by the Talking Heads' Remain in Light track 'The Overload' with humming uncertainty, bleak windswept soundscapes, and a sense of percolating anxiety"".

735,59189,76705138,18370,Italian destroyer Turbine (1901),"Turbine (""Vortex"") was an Italian  destroyer. Commissioned into service in the Italian  (""Royal Navy"") in 1902, she served in the Italo-Turkish War and  She was sunk during the latter conflict in May 1915 on the day after Italy entered the war.

Construction, commissioning, and modernization
Turbine was laid down at the  () in Naples, Italy, on 20 August 1899. She was launched on 21 November 1901 and completed on 28 August 1902. She was commissioned in August 1902. Turbine and the lead ship of her class, , had their armament modified in 1905, with each having her Cannon 76/40 (3 in) Model 1916 gun removed and two additional  torpedo tubes installed, giving them the same armament as that of the following three Nembo-class ships.Nembo destroyers (1902 - 1905) - Regia Marina (Italy).

At various times between 1909 and 1912, each of the Nembo-class destroyers underwent a radical modernization; Turbine′s took place in 1909. Her coal-fired boilers were converted into oil-fired ones, and her original two short, squat funnels were replaced with three smaller, more streamlined ones, profoundly altering her appearance. Her armament also changed, with her original five QF 6 pounder Nordenfelt 57 mm/43 guns replaced by four Cannon 76/40 (3 in) Model 1916 guns, and her original four  torpedo tubes replaced by four  tubes.Marina Militare. In 1914–1915 Turbine underwent additional  modifications, receiving equipment that allowed her to lay 10 to 16 mines.

Service history
Italo-Turkish War
Turbine participated in the Italo-Turkish War, which began on 29 September 1911 with the Kingdom of Italy′s declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire. She was assigned at the time to the 4th Destroyer Squadron along with her sister ships , , and . InternetArchiveBot. On 17 April 1912 she suffered damage in a collision with Nembo, but not enough to prevent her from joining Nembo, the armored cruisers , , , and , the torpedo cruiser , and the torpedo boats , , , and  in a bombardment of the Ottoman forts of Gum-Galesch and Sed Ul Bahr in the Dardanelles on 18 April 1912. The war ended on 18 October 1912 in an Italian victory.

World War I
World War I broke out in 1914, and the Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. At the time, Turbine, under the command of Capitano di corvetta (Corvette Captain) Luigi Bianchi, as well as Aquilone, Borea, Nembo, and their sister ship  made up the 5th Destroyer Squadron, based at Taranto. On the afternoon of 23 May 1915, the day Italy declared war, Turbine and Aquilone got underway to patrol in the Adriatic Sea along the Italian coast as far north as Manfredonia.L'affondamento Del C.t.turbine-la Prima Nave Sacrificatasi Per La Patria- - Betasom - XI Gruppo Sommergibili Atlantici.

While Turbine and Aquilone were on patrol, numerous Austro-Hungarian Navy ships left port during the night of  to carry out previously planned bombardments of military targets and coastal cities along Italy's Adriatic coast. At 04:10 on 24 May Aquilone sighted the Austro-Hungarian light cruiser , which was bombarding Barletta. Aquilone steered to attack Helgoland, but soon found herself having the worst of the clash as Helgoland interrupted her bombardment and pursued the smaller and less-heavily armed Aquilone. At around 04:30, Turbine arrived on the scene, having identified Helgoland from a range of  and closed at high speed to distract Helgoland both from her pursuit of Aquilone and from her bombardment of Barletta. As Aquilone pulled away, Helgoland shifted fire to Turbine and maneuvered to prevent Turbine from interposing herself between Helgoland and the Italian coast.

Outgunned by Helgoland, Turbine took advantage of her greater speed to pull away from the Austro-Hungarian cruiser in an attempt to lure her northward in the direction of the Palagruža (known to the Italians as the Pelagosa) archipelago, where Italian warships that could come to Turbine′s assistance were conducting an amphibious landing. The distance between Turbine and Helgoland increased to over , although with the first light of dawn Turbine had to turn toward the east to avoid running aground on the promontory of Gargano.

At 05:30 Turbine sighted the Austro-Hungarian destroyers  and  — larger, more modern, faster, and better armed than Turbine — off her port bow. As the ships passed Vieste on Gargano, the northbound Turbine was substantially surrounded, with Csepel  off her port quarter, Tátra  astern, and Helgoland  abeam to starboard. The Austro-Hungarian ships opened fire at 05:48, damaging Turbine and wounding some members of her crew, including Bianchi. Turbine returned fire and hit Csepel′s mainmast, wounding some of Csepel′s crew.

At 05:50 the ships temporarily ceased fire after sighting another ship to the north-northeast, but they resumed fire at 06:00, when Tátra was about  from Turbine and Csepel was  away. At 06:10, Turbine′s crew identified the ship sighted at 05:50 as the Austro-Hungarian destroyer , which by then was  from Turbine. At 06:30 Lika, which had closed with Turbine to a range of , opened fire, quickly scoring two hits, a  shell which hit Turbine′s forward boiler, causing a violent explosion that damaged her bridge, and shortly after that a  shell that hit Turbine′s aft boiler and the starboard side of her wheelhouse. Turbine′s engines shut down, and her inertia carried her only for a short distance before she went dead in the water.

The Austro-Hungarian ships closed to a range of , then ceased fire and ordered Turbine′s crew to abandon ship. Turbine′s crew began scuttling procedures, then took to the lifeboats. After destroying secret documents, Bianchi remained aboard the sinking Turbine until the chief helmsman took him onto one of the lifeboats at 06:51. Reduced to a riddled and burning wreck, Turbine sank shortly afterwards.

Turbine′s 53-man crew suffered 10 killed in action. The Austro-Hungarian ships rescued 32 survivors, including Bianchi, and took them as prisoners-of-war. Informed by radio at 06:17 of the clash, the Italian protected cruiser  and auxiliary cruiser , which were supporting the amphibious landing at the Palagruža archipelago, rushed to the scene and engaged in a brief, indecisive clash with the Austro-Hungarian ships before the Austro-Hungarians withdrew. Libia recovered a sailor who had jumped overboard from an Austro-Huungarian ship to avoid becoming a prisoner, while Città di Siracusa rescued eight men and recovered the bodies of two others. Città di Siracusa transferred the survivors and corpses to Libia. Meanwhile, the Austro-Hungarians transported the Italians they had rescued to Sebenico, where an Italian stoker died of burns he had suffered in Turbine′s sinking.

Crew awards

Bianchi received the Silver Medal of Military Valor. The second chief mechanic and two stokers also were decorated ""in memory of"" Turbine. Posthumous Silver Medals of Military Valor went to the stoker who died in Sebenico and one of the men whose bodies Città di Siracusa recovered. The other man whose body Città di Siracusa recovered received a posthumous Bronze Medal of Military Valor.

Commemoration

On 24 May 1932, a marble plaque commemorating Turbine was placed at the entrance of the ravelin of Castle of Barletta on the 17th anniversary of her loss. It reads:

Another plaque commemorating Turbine was placed in Manfredonia.

On 24 May 2019, a monument in memory of the men killed in the sinking of Turbine was dedicated in the gardens in front of the Castle of Barletta.",2024-10-26,"['Nembo-class destroyers' '1901 ships' 'Ships built in Naples'

736,36741,76038939,4291,Un Año Más,"""Un Año Más"" () is a ballad composed by . It was recorded as a Chilean cumbia song in 1977 by the Coquimbo group , then later in the same genre by Sonora Palacios (in 1978) and  (in 1992). Internationally, the piece was recorded in the son style by the Venezuelan group Billo's Caracas Boys, in 1981.

The danceable version of this song has become extremely popular in Chile, especially around New Year celebrations. It is considered Chile's ""New Year's hymn.""

 History 
In December 1977, ahead of New Year's 1978, the professor and composer Hernán Gallardo Pavéz of Coquimbo, Chile, composed the song ""Un Año Más."" It was originally structured as a ballad, evoking the sense of nostalgia that starting a new year brings, and inspired in part by the recent deaths of his parents. Gallardo first offered the song to the popular artist Luis Tirado, to record with the group Los Cumaná, but the group wasn't interested, and the arrangement fell through. Another, danceable version, arranged as a salsa, was done by the group Macalunga, but it was not until Los Vikings 5 recorded it in 1977 as a cumbia song that it more or less settled in its definitive form.

While Gallardo was working as a pianist at the piano bar of the restaurant Alcázar, Marty Palacios, the trumpet player for the tropical orchestra Sonora Palacios, heard him play ""Un Año Más."" Six months later, in 1978, Sonora Palacios recorded the song, resulting in the well-known version that brought ""Un Año Más"" to a wide audience and gave it its continuous popularity. The 1992 cover by La Sonora de Tommy Rey is another popular version.

The song is one of the country's most popular cumbias and is frequently played during New Year's festivities in Chile, particularly as the clock strikes midnight.",2024-12-17,['1977 songs' 'Chilean cumbia' 'New Year songs' 'Chilean songs'],"['Chilean cumbia' 'Coquimbo' 'Sonora Palacios' 'son'

740,38507,76092446,13826,Johnson Bayou High School,"Johnson Bayou High School is a senior high school (grades PK–12) in the community of Johnson Bayou, Louisiana. It is a part of the Cameron Parish School Board and serves the communities of Johnson Bayou and Holly Beach.

Johnson Bayou has the third-smallest enrollment of any high school in the state of Louisiana with 24 enrolled students in grades 9–12.

History
Cameron Parish was formed in 1870 from portions of old Imperial Calcasieu Parish and Vermilion Parish. Education in this rural corner of Southwest Louisiana was challenging for early settlers, made especially so by the marshlands and waterways that make up the bulk of Cameron Parish's geography. By the 1890s there were at least ten public school houses in Cameron Parish in addition to several private schools held in homes dotted throughout the area.

Students who wished to attend high school in Johnson Bayou were bused to school in Hackberry, 35 miles away in northern Cameron Parish, until 1956, when a combined elementary/high school was built at its modern-day location on Gulf Beach Highway. The school's first mascot was the Wildcats, but around 1960, the school's sports teams became known as the Rebels. In 1984, a statue designed by a local artist commemorating General Robert E. Lee was erected on the front lawn of the high school. Representatives of the parish school board and a state senator attended the statue's dedication and members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans presented the Confederate flag.

Though very few Black families lived in Johnson Bayou during Jim Crow, any Black student in Cameron Parish seeking an education was forced to attend one-room schools held in churches scattered throughout lower Cameron Parish. Even then, those schools were centered around the communities of Cameron and Creole, some 25 miles and a ferry ride away. There was no education option for Black students beyond tenth grade at the time. In 1957, the Cameron Parish School Board established the Cameron Consolidated School in Creole though this school would be destroyed just months later by Hurricane Audrey. A replacement school was built and dedicated as Audrey Memorial High School to honor the memory of the more than 400 lives lost in the storm. Audrey Memorial High School closed its doors in 1969 with the advent of school integration in Louisiana and Black students of Johnson Bayou and Holly Beach were able to attend Johnson Bayou High for the first time.

Hurricanes
On June 27, 1957, Hurricane Audrey made landfall just west of Johnson Bayou between the village and Sabine Pass with winds in excess of 125 miles per hour. Audrey was the deadliest hurricane in Louisiana history until Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and, though the community suffered severe damage, the Johnson Bayou school experienced only minor damage and was able to reopen by September 1957 in time for the beginning of the school year.

Four years later, Hurricane Carla sideswiped lower Cameron Parish and caused damage to the JBHS gymnasium floor.

Hurricane Rita made landfall in nearly the same location as Hurricane Audrey on September 24, 2005, bringing storm surge heights to as much as 18 feet in parts of lower Cameron Parish, including Johnson Bayou. Damage to the school, most notably a wall blown out by wind and storm surge, forced students to once again attend school in Hackberry. Donations from local industries helped the school get back on its feet, providing temporary buildings, classroom furnishings and audio-visual equipment, including a 30-station mobile laptop lab, as well as new bleachers and a new gymnasium floor to replace the ones destroyed by the storm.

Repairs were made to the school plant following Rita, but an even worse disaster for the school lay ahead. Three years later, Hurricane Ike made landfall on the Texas Gulf Coast and devastated the school once again with storm surge heights reaching at least 12–15 feet from Sabine Pass to Calcasieu Pass, including Johnson Bayou. Roughly 80 percent of the school's building was destroyed by the storm, leaving students in Johnson Bayou without a permanent school facility for almost seven years. Groundbreaking on the new school building, elevated now on storm piers, took place in January 2013. It was the last of four schools in Cameron Parish to begin the rebuilding process.

""This community has suffered a great deal including loss in population and loss of enrollment, so this is actually commitment of the school board to the future of this community that it will thrive and that's why a school needed to be again the heart of this community of Johnson Bayou,"" Cameron Parish Schools Superintendent Stephanie Rodrigue said at the groundbreaking. ""We hope that it can endure anything that Mother Nature puts in its path.""

Construction was completed on the new 64,000-square foot, $17 million facility in August 2015 and students returned to the rebuilt Johnson Bayou High School on August 12, 2015, almost seven years after Hurricane Ike.

The new school was put to the test in 2020 when the southwest Louisiana coast was slammed by a pair of intense hurricanes. In the early morning hours of August 27, 2020, Hurricane Laura, the most powerful hurricane to strike Louisiana since the 1856 Last Island hurricane made landfall at Cameron causing immense destruction across lower Cameron Parish. Fortunately for Johnson Bayou, the focus of the most intense damage was centered some 30 miles east of the town, sparing it the worst of the storm surge. Just six weeks later, Hurricane Delta made landfall just 12 miles east of where Hurricane Laura did, becoming the fourth hurricane to landfall in Louisiana that year. Yet despite hurricane-force winds causing some minor damage, Johnson Bayou was the first campus to completely reopen following the storms.

Academics

743,27162,5324126,5540,MLK (song),"""MLK"" is a song by Irish rock band U2, and is the tenth and final track on their 1984 album, The Unforgettable Fire. An elegy to Martin Luther King Jr., it is a short, pensive piece with simple lyrics (""Sleep/Sleep tonight/And may your dreams/Be realized/If the thundercloud/Passes rain/So let it rain/Rain down on me""). It was because of this song and ""Pride (In the Name of Love)"", another tribute to King, that lead vocalist Bono received the highest honor of the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change, an organization founded by Coretta Scott King.

Writing and recording
""MLK"" originated from a melody and set of lyrics composed by lead vocalist Bono while listening to the pitched hum of his vacuum cleaner. According to guitarist the Edge, the band ""failed miserably"" to find a musical arrangement that suited the melody and that the results ""always sounded far too traditional"". When the group decided to revisit the song, they started with just the vocal melody and a drone note to see which musical direction it would take them. The resulting arrangement sounded complete to them, convincing them not to refine it any further.

Live performances
Its live debut was on 18 October 1984, as an intro to ""The Unforgettable Fire"", and the two songs were performed together at almost all Unforgettable Fire Tour shows and most Joshua Tree Tour shows. However, by the end of the Joshua Tree Tour, the band started to use ""MLK"" to precede other songs, especially ""One Tree Hill"", and it continued in this capacity on the Lovetown Tour. It failed to appear on the Zoo TV Tour but returned to the set list on the PopMart Tour, especially after the deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales and Michael Hutchence. It went into another hiatus after PopMart, missing the entire Elevation Tour, but was notably performed as the intro to ""Where the Streets Have No Name"" at U2's appearance during the Super Bowl XXXVI halftime show in 2002. After the death of Rosa Parks, it made five Vertigo Tour appearances; in all five instances, it was sung after ""One"" to conclude the main set. ""MLK"" was a part of the main set list for the U2 360° Tour, as the prelude to ""Walk On"". The song was dropped midway through the tour and was replaced with ""Scarlet"". It was not played live again until The Joshua Tree Tours 2017 and 2019, during which it was played on opening night before being replaced by ""Bad"" the following night.

 In popular culture 
""MLK"" was director Richard Kelly's original choice for the soundtrack to the final sequence of the 2001 film Donnie Darko. After difficulties licensing the song, it was decided to use Gary Jules' rendition of the Tears for Fears song ""Mad World"" instead.""Out of the realm of imagination"", Geoff Edgers, The Boston Globe, March 21, 2004.

In Stephen Chbosky's 1999 novel The Perks of Being a Wallflower, ""MLK"" is mentioned as one of Charlie's favorite songs, along with ""Blackbird"".

744,53048,5396711,7400,Savage Islands (film),"Savage Islands (also known as Nate and Hayes in the United States) is a 1983 swashbuckling adventure film set in the South Pacific in the late 19th century. Directed by Ferdinand Fairfax and filmed on location in Fiji and New Zealand, it starred Tommy Lee Jones, Michael O'Keefe and Jenny Seagrove.

It was one of several 1980s films designed to capitalize on the popularity of Indiana Jones, but Savage Islands was a flop at the box office.

Plot
The film tells the story of missionary Nathaniel ""Nate"" Williamson, taken to an island mission with his fiancée Sophie. Their ship, the Rona, is captained by the roguish William ""Bully"" Hayes, who also takes a liking to Sophie. When Sophie is kidnapped by slave trader Ben Pease, ""Nate"" teams with Hayes in order to find her.  The two men enjoy a friendly rivalry for Sophie's affections, and she is to some extent torn between them, though committed to Nate.

Production
The story was based on the adventures of real-life blackbirders Bully Hayes and Ben Pease. The character of Hayes was much softened in the film and Pease turned into a villain. The script was rewritten by John Hughes.

The director was Ferdinand Fairfax, an Englishman most recently notable for his direction of the television series, Churchill — The Wilderness Years. Fairfax described the film as a tongue-in-cheek adventure in the style of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. ""I'm not making Carry on Pirates or anything like that, but I think it will be a very funny film"", he said.

The film was entirely financed with New Zealand money but achieved distribution in the US. Producer Phillips raised money in part on the back of the success of his short film, Dollar Bottom.

The film was shot in Fiji, Rotorua and Urupukapuka Island. At Urupukapuka, the producers built a set reconstructing the Port of Samoa.

Release and reception
The film has a cult following which seems to have encouraged the release of the film on Region 1 and Region 2 DVD, in June and November 2006 respectively.

Reception
In his review, Roger Ebert gave the film one star and called it 'inexplicable', criticizing the tone and plot. The New York Times gave plaudits to the performances, but felt the film was 'no fun at all', criticizing the inconsistent action and production values.

Colin Greenland reviewed Savage Islands for Imagine magazine, and stated that ""Savage Islands doesn't have quite the pace or panache of Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it is first-class nonsense.""

Legacy
Sir Richard Taylor of Weta Workshop said Savage Islands kick-started the New Zealand filmmaking boom of the 1980s.

Savage Islands inspired Lawrence Watt-Evans to write the 1992 novella The Final Folly of Captain Dancy.'How I Came to Write ""The Final Folly of Captain Dancy""' at Watt-Evans.com; by Lawrence Watt-Evans; published December 2008; retrieved 4 June 2013",2024-12-04,"['1983 films' '1980s New Zealand films' '1983 drama films'

745,50530,367524,22461,The Idle Race,"The Idle Race were a British rock group from Birmingham who in the late 1960s and early 1970s had a cult following but never enjoyed mass commercial success. In addition to being the springboard for Jeff Lynne, the band holds a place of significance in British Midlands' pop-rock history as a link between the Move, Electric Light Orchestra, the Steve Gibbons Band and Mike Sheridan & The Nightriders.

Band history
The Nightriders (1959–1966)
The band was initially formed in 1959, under the name Billy King and the Nightriders, and consisted of the core members Dave Pritchard on rhythm guitar and Roger Spencer on drums, along with vocalist Billy King, bass guitarist Brian Cope, and lead guitarist Al Johnson. In 1962, King departed the band and was replaced by Mike Tyler, who changed his surname to Sheridan for performance purposes. This change coincided with the band's rise (as Mike Sheridan and the Nightriders), culminating with a record deal with EMI in 1964. By this time Cope had been replaced by Greg Masters, and Johnson by lead guitarist and composer Roy Wood, in 1963 and 1964, respectively. Wood, who went on to find greater success in his subsequent bands, had his first commercially released composition with The Nightriders, ""Make Them Understand"", which appeared as the B-side of a 1965 single.

By December 1965, Wood had joined forces with other musicians to form the Move, leading to his departure from the Nightriders in January 1966, when the Move started touring. Wood's place in the Nightriders was filled by Johnny Mann, who had previously performed with Wood's new bandmate in the Move, Carl Wayne, in Wayne's previous band the Vikings. Sheridan, feeling that the band had come full circle, decided to depart the group shortly thereafter—although Sheridan later toured with various musicians using the Nightriders' moniker. The losses of Sheridan and Wood led the band to change direction. The band shortened their name to the Nightriders (dropping Sheridan's name), reflecting the fact that the band was now going to lack a dedicated frontman and would feature various members performing lead vocals. Shortly after signing a new recording contract with Polydor Records, Mann departed and was replaced by Jeff Lynne, who at the time was an unknown guitar prodigy from the Birmingham district of Shard End. Their time at Polydor was short, and they recorded only one single, ""It's Only The Dog""/""Your Friend"", released in November 1966, with Lynne on lead guitar. Spencer sang lead on the A-side while the B-side was written and sung by Pritchard.

The Idle Race (1966–1972)
Eager to showcase Lynne's vocal and guitar skills as well as his growing cache of catchy Beatlesque songs, and wishing to embrace the new psychedelic movement, the group changed its name again, first to the Idyll Race and then to the Idle Race. Wood, now a major star as the Move became a successful chart act, helped arrange a partnership with pop producers Eddie Offord and Gerald Chevin for the Idle Race. In 1967, the band were the first major signing by the new British arm of Liberty Records. Only their first single (not issued in the UK) and their first album got released in the US on Liberty.

The group were well received by the music press for their melodies, whimsical lyrics, and inventive production. They often appeared on the same bill with such bands as the Spencer Davis Group, the Who, Small Faces, Pink Floyd, the Moody Blues, Status Quo, Tyrannosaurus Rex, Yes, Free, and the Move. In addition to original material, their set list included extended covers of Steppenwolf's ""Born to Be Wild"", the Jimi Hendrix Experience's ""Purple Haze"", Moby Grape's ""Hey Grandma,"" The Lemon Pipers' ""Blueberry Blue,"" The Doors' ""Love Me Two Times"", and an electric version of ""Debora"" by Tyrannosaurus Rex.

BBC disc jockeys such as John Peel and Kenny Everett were big boosters of the group. But despite critical respect and famous admirers such as The Beatles and Marc Bolan, Idle Race failed to catch on with the public.

Bad luck sabotaged efforts from the start. Their debut single on Liberty, a cover of Wood's ""Here We Go 'Round the Lemon Tree"", was scheduled for release and heavily promoted in September 1967. When the Move's version began getting national airplay around the UK as the B-side of the hit ""Flowers In The Rain,"" Liberty abruptly pulled the single in the UK. It was, however, released by Liberty in the US. The record company replaced it in the UK with Lynne's ""Impostors of Life's Magazine"" in October.

""The Skeleton and the Roundabout"" (February 1968) and ""The End of the Road"" (June 1968) suffered similar fates. Work continued throughout the year on the Idle Race's debut album, the group commuting in from Birmingham to London on Sundays, when they were granted free studio time at Advision. The resulting album, The Birthday Party, was released in October of that year.

Lynne and Wood's mutual respect and friendship deepened. The demo for the Move hit ""Blackberry Way"" was recorded in Lynne's front room and borrowed motifs from the Idle Race; the chorus of Lynne's 1969 song ""Days of the Broken Arrows"" lifted part of a riff from the Move's ""Wild Tiger Woman"".

Lynne received an offer to replace Trevor Burton in the Move in February 1969 but declined with hopes of steering The Idle Race to commercial success — and producing the band's second LP for Liberty.

The self-titled Idle Race was released in September 1969 in the UK with sleeve photography and design by Michael Hasted. The two Lynne-penned and produced singles that preceded the LP, ""Days of the Broken Arrows"" (April 1969) and ""Come With Me"" (July 1969) also failed to chart. Idle Race, the first album to be produced by Lynne, flopped.

In January 1970, Lynne accepted a second offer by Wood to join the Move, on condition that they would eventually retire that band and concentrate on a new venture, Electric Light Orchestra.

Lynne made two albums, Looking On and Message from the Country, and a handful of singles with the Move, including the first version of ""Do Ya"", as work on the first ELO album continued in the studio throughout 1970 and 1971. The Move, now comprising just Wood, Lynne and drummer Bev Bevan, ceased touring in 1970, and adopted the name ELO permanently in 1972.

Meanwhile, Mike Hopkins (guitar) and Dave Walker (vocals) were hired to replace Lynne in the Idle Race. A cover of Mungo Jerry's ""In the Summertime"" on Liberty in 1970 finally got them into the top 10 in Argentina. A cover of Hotlegs' ""Neanderthal Man"" did not fare as well. In 1971 the band produced their final album, Time Is, for Regal Zonophone (UK only); despite this, the band collapsed shortly thereafter with the departures of remaining founding members Pritchard and Spencer (who later became comic ""Ollie Spencer""), along with Hopkins and Walker. Sole remaining member Greg Masters built another version of the band with guitarists Dave Carroll and Bob Wilson and drummer Bob Lamb, with Steve Gibbons being recruited later as front-man. Ultimately, this lineup was short-lived: Masters himself departed in February 1972 and was replaced by Bob Griffin, whose tenure in the band was brief and who was replaced by former the Move member Trevor Burton. The Idle Race then, finally, disbanded, with the final lineup becoming the founding lineup of the Steve Gibbons Band.

749,44225,76250590,18821,Red PAT,"PAT (Periodistas Asociados Televisión, literally Associate Journalists Television), also called Red PAT, is a Bolivian over-the-air television channel founded as a production company in August 1990 by the politician and journalist Carlos Mesa. It became a channel in 1998.

History
As a production company
On August 1, 1990, Carlos Mesa, Mario Espinoza, Amalia Pandohttps://www.historia.com.bo/biografia/amalia-pando-vega Amalia Pando and Ximena Valdiviahttp://www.bibliotecavirtualcarlosdmesa.com/curriculum/curriculum/2 created the PAT company, initially as a news producer. The idea originated when at Telesistema Boliviano, Pando, Mesa and Espinoza, agreed to establish their own news production company (the first of its kind in Bolivia); Valdivia provided the loans. The independent news production company produced two newscasts: 2nd Edition at noon and 3rd Edition at night. The name 1st Edition was reserved until the birth of the channel. The first channel was Canal Once, under the direction of René Meyer, broadcasting began on September 15 of the same year. In 1990 it was broadcast on América Televisión (channel 6 in La Paz); and in 1997 to Bolivisión when it was just beginning its broadcasts, its headquarters were on Av. Saavedra in Miraflores and the production company had no problems since its birth, it won the 1992-1997 tender of the ADN-MIR alliance (being the only bidder), the 1997-2001 tender of the MNR Government. Apart from the newscast, the PAT production company produced three more programs: De Frente, hosted and directed by Amalia Pando, focused on investigative reporting; Behind the News hosted by Mario Espinoza with a documentary format and focused on historical events and De Cerca hosted by Carlos Mesa, but broadcast from the ATB network studios. Carlos Mesa's production company was also involved in the production of a national film: Jonás y la ballena rosada, a joint production with Mexico.[ in 1995. Between September 1983 and March 1998, one of its main programs, De Cerca, conducted 472 interviews, statistically more than half were given to 81 personalities, with Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada appearing a record fifteen times.

In 1998, when PAT was setting up its own network, Bolivisión ceased carrying its newscasts and started producing its own.

Crisis as a production company and creation of Red PAT
In August 1997, Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada handed over the presidential sash to Hugo Banzer Suarez. Its main partner is the MIR, the conflict arose when PAT (through the bidding of the then TVB) denounced the so-called narco-links, emphatically denounced by PAT. This time, the anti-gonism that was in the government would not make any more concessions. With Carlos Mesa leaving TVB, he founded his own channel, with the same name as his production company, PAT. In October 1998, PAT moved a few meters higher and inaugurated its new building. The list indicated the three main shareholders and two minor shareholders: Barbery, Mesa and Valdivia.

With the corporate participation of the owner of El Deber, the airing of PAT was financed. To make it a reality, 100,000 US dollars were deposited in the Telecommunications Superintendency (current ATT) to obtain the license. Another development was the creation of Ítaca on August 1, 1998, with four new shareholders. PAT moves from its former two-floor facility to a new five-floor building. In September 1998 PAT became a national network. The network was also able to send its newscasts and sports programs to Sistema Unido de Retransmisión in the United States and other parts of the world.RED - PATbolivia

The channel initially pledged not to broadcast telenovelas, but eventually started airing a Brazilian one. In this period, Red PAT won three Best UHF Channel awards from independent surveys in 1998, 1999 and 2001.RED - PAT

Espinoza era (2002-2007) and sale to Daher (2007-2012)
Once Carlos Mesa left the direction of PAT, Abdallah Edmond Daher Bulus, a shareholder of Aerosur, bought his shares and the identity of the channel changed and the Santa Cruz branch became more important. In the 2002 general elections, the MNR, the party for which Mesa was running, won by a small margin. The time was turbulent and just a few months later Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada resigned the presidency and Carlos Mesa assumed office. In 2003 Mario Espinoza created a program called El Pentagono where the future vice president Álvaro García Linera regularly attended as a panelist and also Verónica Larrieu,http://www.bolivia.com/noticias/autonoticias/DetalleNoticia12261.asp Verónica Larrieu a model from Santa Cruz. Amalia Pando resigns due to differences between her and the other shareholders of the network.

The government of Evo Morales was constantly criticized in No Mentirás and focused on the economic and legal suffocation of the Aerosur airline, pointing to one of its shareholders Abdallah Daher, who as owner of Red PAT made these criticisms. Finally, in 2012, after years of economic and legal problems, Aerosur closed and Abdallah Daher had to sell his shares in PAT, making it a condescending media outlet for the ruling party.

According to a 2011 survey conducted by Revista IN, PAT was the fourth most watched national network in Bolivia, with 8% of the audience share, up from 4% in 2008.

2012 to 2019
Between 2012 and 2019, the PAT network had adopted a different editorial line. The programming is based on newscasts, talk-shows, reality-shows and some self-produced documentaries. The main newscasts are broadcast from Santa Cruz de la Sierra and La Paz. Also since 2015, it begins to pay licenses from Televisa, Telemundo, Grupo Imagen and Nickelodeon, among others.

PAT had become a parastatal outlet since 2011 and was partial to the Government of Evo Morales. The channel is accused of evading taxes in exchange for being the third channel to receive advertising and government sponsorship (behind Bolivia TV and Red ATB, first and second respectively), in addition to being managed by businessmen related to former vice president Álvaro García Linera. In return for this, the company that owns it begins to produce documentaries that, according to its editorial line, favor the government party.

In 2015, the channel premiered an adaptation of the Peruvian format Esto es guerra, which in the middle of that year was renewed for a second season. The network announced in February 2018 that it would install a new HD-ready master control facility in Santa Cruz, which would be used to connect with the Túpac Katari satellite (TKSAT-1), which was already delivering PAT's signals in HD. It was expected that digital terrestrial broadcasts for the network would start in November 2019.Carlos Aguilera de la Red PAT de Bolivia: Instalaremos un nuevo master control en Santa Cruz In April 2018, during its 2018 screening, it unveiled a new brand identity, accompanied by a new slogan, Vive todos los colores (live all colors), reflecting its new vision to Bolivians and emphasizing its commitment to national productions.PAT te ofrece los colores de la vida By February 2019, installation of the new master controls from Ross and Harmonic were underway, first in Santa Cruz and later in La Paz, as well as the digitization of the PAT stations in the trunk axis (Santa Cruz, La Paz, Cochabamba)Carlos Aguilera de red PAT de Bolivia: Con Ross y Harmonic estamos instalando master control en Santa Cruz

Since 2019
On November 10, 2019, derived from the Bolivian political crisis that led to the renunciation of Evo Morales, and the succession by Jeanine Áñez, the Ministry of Government inisiated a series of penal lawsuits against the network's administrators, as well as ATB's executives, and the national newspaper La Razón, accusating them of illicit economic acts with the government party and Evo Morales.

In this case, Marcelo Hurtado was implicated in the irregular purchase of PAT, which led to his arrest and being charged on January 3, 2020, by the Bolivian Prosecutor's Office. Hurtado is released, and then he is detained again, this time, by ATB. Months later he reported being extorted by prosecutor Marco Cossió to give up shares and control over ATB.

Unlike ATB and La Razón, PAT did not take up an editorial line favorable to the MAS-IPSP and the government of Luis Arce.

The former executives, with former minister Hector Arce Zaconeta as lawyer, begin a legal battle against Daher to regain financial and editorial control of the outlet. However, on November 17, 2021, Judge Angela Patricia Hira restored PAT's shares in favor of Daher.

Controversies
Usage of footage from Lost claiming as footage of the Air France crash
On June 18, 2009, PAT's news service ran a report showing supposed footage of the Air France crash that happened nineteen days earlier. It was revealed that the footage came from the pilot of Lost. The photos were supposedly attributed to supposed passenger Paulo Muller, which was non-existent, and the supposed Air France plane was from the fictional airline Oceanic Airlines, name used in a variety of TV series and movies, to prevent allusions to real-life airlines and their accidents. The camera supposedly came from Serra do Cachimbo in Brazil.

In an interview on the program No Mentiras, hosted by Jimena Antelo and produced by José Pomacusi, the then Commander of the Army, Juan José Zúñiga, was interviewed, where he accused Evo Morales of instigating polarization and of obtaining the nomination at all costs. to the presidency. These events preceded the attempted coup d'état in Bolivia.

From next season it would become the fourth highest tier. The 1. Liga is and remains the highest tier in Swiss amateur football, but many teams at that time had professional or semi-professional players.

Format
The 1. Liga in the 2011–12 season was divided into three regional groups, each with 16 teams. Within each group, the teams would play a double round-robin to decide their positions in the league. Due to the creation of the 1. Liga Promotion that was due to commence the following year, this season would see the number of teams in the groups reduced from 16 to 14 and it would be renamed as 1. Liga Classic. The new Promotion League would serve as the semi-professional link to amateur football. Six clubs could achieve promotion to the new third division, if they had applied for the semi-professional status. Due to the bankruptcy of Xamax in January 2012 it resulted that seven clubs were promoted. The four best U-21 teams would receive a wild card and advance as well. This reconstruction was done to decrease the competitive gap between the professional two top tiers and the amateur leagues.

The mixtape was released by Young Money Records and Republic Records on September 29, 2023. It consists of 10 tracks, including the single ""Kat Food"", and features guest appearances from Jon Batiste, Euro, Cool & Dre, and Fousheé.

 Promotion and release 
The mixtape's first and only single ""Kat Food"" was released on September 1, 2023. It charted at number 4 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100. On September 20, 2023, he posted a link to pre-save the album on his Instagram and Twitter pages, as well as revealing the cover of the album. The cover is reminiscent of his 2011 mixtape Sorry 4 the Wait. He then revealed the album's track list on September 27, in which he also announced that the album was going to release on September 29, 2023.

 Critical reception 

Tha Fix Before Tha VI received negative reviews from critics.

AllMusic stated that his discography ""includes some of the most incredible music to ever grace the rap genre, but if Tha Fix Before Tha VI is any indication of where he's going next, it might usher in the sad realization that the days when Wayne could confidently proclaim himself the ""best rapper alive"" are behind him.""

Robin Murray of Clash said that the album ""contains numerous experiments, collaborations, and drafts, indicating his willingness to continually step outside convention – yet it doesn’t always land.""

HipHopDXs Alec Siegel said, ""It’s impressive that Wayne’s storied recording schedule has evidently remained consistent three decades into his career."" But he then called the album ""a potent reminder that some music is best kept stashed in the vault""

HotNewHipHop said ""Wayne is clearly a gifted rapper, but his songwriting is still inconsistent and the project is tainted by lazy choruses and poor production selection. Let’s hope that Lil Wayne is saving his best material for Tha Carter VI.""

 Commercial performance 
""Tha Fix Before Tha VI"" debuted at number 40 on the US Billboard 200 chart, moving 19,000 units.

754,25959,75715002,7263,House of Representatives Practice,"The House of Representatives Practice is an Australian parliamentary authority published by the Australian House of Representatives. The first edition was published in 1981 edited by John Athol Pettifer CBE, Clerk of the Australian House of Representatives from 1976 to 1982.

Currently in its seventh edition, published in 2018, the text is the comprehensive and authoritative guide to the procedure and practice of the Australian House of Representatives. The equivalent guide in the Australian Senate is Odgers' Australian Senate Practice.

Background
The Australian Constitution provides that the houses of the Australian parliament can make rules relating to the conduct of its proceedings ""separately or jointly with the other house"". Standing Orders were first agreed during the first parliament in 1901 and continued to be used and amended from that time, however, in situations where Standing Orders were silent Erskine May's Parliamentary Practice, and the rules and procedures of the House of Commons served as a guide to the procedures of the House. Over time standing orders became more complete and the organic procedure of the House had developed so that, by the 1970s, Only in matters of privilege was the house referring to Erskine May with any regularity.

In 1975 the Speaker, acting on a recommendation of the House Standing Orders Committee, agreed to the preparation of the publication that became the House of Representatives Practice. It was envisioned, accurately so it turns out, that this book would become the domestic equivalent of Erskine May.

An official book launch for the first edition was held on 10 December 1981 by the Speaker, Mr Billy Snedden, in the presence of the Governor General, Sir Zelman Cowen and the Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Harry Gibbs.

Biography
Born Jeanne de La Saulcée at the end of the 15th century, on an unknown date. In 1516, she married the Lyon printer-publisher Barnabé Chaussard and brought him as a dowry of half a house located “rue Mercière, near Notre-Dame-de-Confort,"" situated between the bookseller Aimé de La Porte and the printer François Fradin. Chaussard set up his printing house there. The couple had six children, four daughters and two sons.

Barnabé Chaussard died at the end of 1527 while Jeanne's two sons, heirs to the business, were still minors, so she took over as head of the printing operation, publishing house and bookstore, under the name of her late husband.

After her remarriage to her workshop manager Jean Lambany at the end of 1528, she left the company's management to her new husband, who published under his own name. Widowed again in December 1529, she changed the company name to: “Veuve de Barnabé Chaussard” (Widow of Barnabé Chaussard). 

In June 1533, she married for the third time, this time to her former protege, Jean Cantarel, known as “Motin” who managed the business from 1533 to 1552 under the name “In the house of the late Barnabé Chaussard.” In 1552, when Barnabé's two sons, François and Benoît Chaussard, came of age, Jeanne de La Saulcée left the management of the printing company to them. 

Unlike Charlotte Guillard, the printing press did not directly bear Jeanne's first name but instead it reflected her married name and her status as a widow, committing to paying her taxes and employing a man for tasks falling within the male domain she was however one of the rare female figures of the Lyon humanist printing press with seven other widows.

She died in Lyon in 1559.

Selected works
Notably, Jeanne's company published Les Grandes et Inestimables Chroniques du grand et enormous giant Gargantua, by François Rabelais, printed in 1532 in a small format of which only four copies are known.

This herbaceous perennial plant is native to Southern Europe and grown throughout the world as an ornamental garden plant. It grows  tall, with leaves that are palmately veined, with a scalloped and serrated margin. The stipules are noteworthy in that they are fused together and leaf like. The chartreuse yellow flowers are held in dense clusters above the foliage. A. mollis has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. The plant self-seeds freely and can become invasive.

According to some accounts, lady's mantle has been used for centuries as a herbal remedy. According to other authorities, however, it has never been used medicinally, but has been confused with two species that have a history of medicinal use: A. alpina (Alpine lady's mantle) and A. xanthochlora.

The plant is often grown as groundcover, and is valued for the appearance of its leaves in wet weather. Water beads on the leaves due to their dewetting properties. These beads of water were considered by alchemists to be the purest form of water. They used this water in their quest to turn base metal into gold, hence the name Alchemilla. The Latin specific epithet mollis means ""soft"", referring to the hairs on the leaves.

764,23198,75641398,9633,"Church of Saint John the Baptist, Busto Arsizio","The prepositural collegiate basilica of San Giovanni Battista is a Catholic church in Busto Arsizio, dedicated to one of the patron saints of the city. Like the church of San Michele Arcangelo, this building also stands on the remains of a small Lombard chapel about eight metres wide.

In 1948 the church was elevated to the dignity of minor basilica. The bell tower was constructed from 1400 to 1418, and is the oldest part of the church.

History

It is one of the most important baroque works in the province of Varese. Built to a design by Francesco Maria Richini., the foundation stone of the new basilica was laid on 26 May 1609, but the first service was not held until 1614, when the work was not yet completed, on the occasion of the patron saint's feast day. From the registers of the Fabrica di S. Giovanni and on the basis of the chronicles of the curate Pietro Antonio Crespi Castoldi, we know that from 1609 to 1613 the bones of the old cemetery near the church bell tower were removed and the perimeter foundations were laid, followed by the construction of the chapel dedicated to Sant'Ambrogio. The apses of the old church were demolished in 1610 and the main chapel was built between 1611 and 1612. The transept was completed in 1614 and its chapels were immediately used for the celebration of religious services. The foundations of the new façade were laid in March 1616 and in the same year, the chapel of St. Charles and the chapel of the Relics were built.  Work continued at a slow pace for various reasons, including the plague of 1630, and the dome was completed in 1635, 26 years after work began.

The basilica was consecrated in 1640 or 1646 by the bishop of Bobbino, Monsignor Francesco Maria Abbiati.

Architectural Design
Exterior

Façade
The imposing façade consists of a lower order of coupled Ionic style pilasters, a prothyrum with an arched pediment, doors made of copper and bronze with bas-reliefs depicting the life of St. John the Baptist (work of Enrico Astorri from 1908), statues of St. Ambrose, St. Charles Borromeo, Faith and Charity and countless other works from various eras. However, the façade was still incomplete: the upper part was completed between 1699 and 1701 by Domenico Valmagini, who inserted a large oval window, a double-curved broken pediment, the statues of St. Peter St. Paul and four prophets (all works by Giovanni Pozzi), and the central statue of St. John the Baptist (by Siro Zanelli), which represents the highest point of the façade.

Bell Tower

Built in the early years of the 15th century, the basilica's bell tower was built for two reasons: one was obviously religious since in 1400 the town of Busto Arsizio was experiencing a period of plague that increased religious commotion to the point of building a concrete work that symbolised the devotion of the people of Busto Arsizio. The second was military: the construction of the bell tower was, in fact, partly financed by the municipality, as it could have been used as a watchtower for defensive purposes since the church was located not far from the centre of the rectangle of fortifications. Inserito in  In 1409, the main bell was cast and placed on the bell tower, while the construction was completed in 1418, the year Pope Martin V came to Milan for the consecration of the high altar of the Duomo.

Interior

Inside, the church is covered with barrel vaults and ribbed vaults, the three naves are separated by rows of Ionic style piers and columns. Under the arches hang large canvases depicting the life of St. John the Baptist, painted between the end of the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th century by unknown artists, with the exception of Jesus with the disciples of the Baptist and Herodias and Salome with the head of the Baptist, attributed to Carlo Preda. The left transept hosts, instead, two frescoes of the 17th century (Rest during the Flight into Egypt and Nativity), attributed to Antonio Crespi Castoldi. More recent (between 1904 and 1923) are the decorations with pinkish grit and variegated marble (by Giuseppe Cerami and Pirro Bottaro) and the frescoes of the dome (Glorification of the Baptist), the pendentives (Evangelists) and the vaults (Blessed Juliana and Blessed Bernardino, Immaculate Conception, The Eucharist and The Pope) and the minor transept (Four Prophets) all works by Carlo Grossi, as well as the Way of the Cross in bronze and the portals by Enrico Astorri (1908). On the other hand, carved wooden works such as the pulpit, the choir and the compass date back to the 18th century. Over a period of eight years, between 1757 and 1765, Biagio Bellotti realised the frescoes of the apsidal area of the church. On the vault of the chancel is depicted the Glory of St. Sabinus, in the apse basin Paradise and on the wall of the apse The Baptism of Jesus Christ in the waters of the Jordan''.

 ""Mortuary"" 

Outside the church, on the right-hand side, is the ""mortorio"", a small temple by an unknown author, painted between 6 September 1689 and 2 November 1692, which was meant to remind passers-by of the mystery of death by displaying skulls, still visible today from Via Milano. Inside, there are paintings of angels and symbolism on the Passion. Paintings were also visible outside, works by the brothers Ambrogio Gelli, Francesco and Biagio Bellotti (the latter grandfather of the Bustocco painter of the same name), depicting the ages of man, the various aspects of death, virtues, purgatory and weeping angels, removed in 1975 and transferred to the Church of San Gregorio Magno in Camposanto.",2024-11-11,['Churches in Lombardy' 'Catholic churches dedicated to John the Baptist'],"['Catholic church' 'Busto Arsizio' 'church of San Michele Arcangelo'

765,45862,5377658,11818,Tackley railway station,"Tackley railway station is on the Cherwell Valley Line in Oxfordshire, England, serving the village of Tackley and its surrounding area. Great Western Railway operates the station and all but one of the trains serving it. The exception is a weekday late night service to  operated by Chiltern Railways.

Measured via  the station is  from .

History
When the Oxford – Banbury section of the Oxford and Rugby Railway opened in 1850 the nearest station was Woodstock Road, which was at Enslow  south of Tackley. In the 1930s, in response to increasing competition from bus services, the Great Western Railway opened a number of new halts. One of these was Tackley, which was opened on 6 April 1931.

Services
Most services at Tackley are operated by Great Western Railway, with a very limited service operated by Chiltern Railways.

The typical off-peak service is one train every two hours in each direction between  and , operated by Great Western Railway. Additional services call at the station during the peak hours. The station is also served by a single late evening service from  to Banbury, operated by Chiltern Railways on weekdays only.

On Sundays, the station is served by three Great Western Railway services in each direction between Oxford and Banbury during the summer months (between May and September) only. No services call at the station on Sundays during the winter months.

Level crossing

The GWR sited Tackley halt just north of a level crossing on the road linking Tackley with the village of Kirtlington. This had a crossing keeper on duty 24 hours a day and the gates were interlocked with the railway signalling system. However, the route later ceased to be a through road between the two villages, so the railway company withdrew the crossing keeper and redesignated the crossing to be operated by its users.

It was then made an occupation crossing and the only vehicles allowed to use it were those authorised to have access to Tackley Estate. It had large gates for vehicles and small ones for pedestrians. This was still the case in 2009, but by 2012 the large gates had been replaced by fences and the surface for vehicles to cross the tracks had been removed (see photo).

The crossing is used by a bridleway linking Tackley and Kirtlington, which is now also part of National Cycle Route 51. The crossing is also the only passenger access to and from the ""up"" platform (i.e. for trains from Banbury or to Oxford, Reading and London). As of 2009 Network Rail had 165 unprotected level crossings related to its stations, 26 of which were defined as ""user-worked"" or ""footpath crossings"". However, Tackley crossing is the only one that combines station access with a public bridleway.

Bridge and subway proposals

In 1999 Railtrack plc launched its Reading – Birmingham Cross Country Route Modernisation Project, which was to increase maximum speeds from  to  ready for Virgin CrossCountry's plan to introduce its new Voyager trains in 2002 (Operation Princess). Higher train speeds would increase the risk of a train colliding with someone on a user-worked level crossing, so in 2000 Railtrack asked West Oxfordshire District Council (WODC) for planning permission to build a footbridge. The bridge would serve passengers and other pedestrians but not vehicles, so the level crossing would have to remain.

In 2001 WODC refused planning permission for a footbridge purely because of its appearance. The council declared ""that the proposed footbridge will, by reason of its size, design and use of materials represent an alien, incongruous and overtly urban feature in this rural location"". In 2002 Railtrack responded by requesting planning permission for a subway under the railway for pedestrians, equestrians and cyclists. Railtrack and the Tackley Estate agreed an alternative route for vehicular access, and thus it would be possible to close the crossing completely. Because of the topography of the site, the subway would have to be  south of Tackley station. WODC again refused planning permission, this time asserting ""the design's failure to make safe and convenient provision for horses, their riders, pedestrians, cyclists, the elderly and disabled people; and that the subway would appear as an unduly prominent and intrusive feature in the rural scene"". Oxfordshire County Council supported WODC's refusal.

At the same time the Department for Transport removed Railtrack from controlling Britain's rail network. The DfT created a new company, by Network Rail (NR), which revised the subway proposal and lodged a planning appeal against WODC's refusal of planning permission for it.  A planning inspector visited the crossing and, unlike WODC, commented that the subway would improve access to and from the ""up"" platform for passengers with some types of disability. In July 2003 the inspector upheld NR's appeal and granted planning permission for the subway.

However, in September 2002 Virgin CrossCountry had already introduced its accelerated timetable and by July 2003 NR had nearly finished the CrossCountry Route Modernisation, but without increasing train speeds through Tackley station. NR was drawing the project to a close and it did not implement the plan for a subway at Tackley. The planning permission was valid for five years and lapsed, unused, in July 2008.

Fatality and near miss

On 31 March 2008 Margaret Evans, an 82-year-old Tackley resident, was struck and killed by a CrossCountry Voyager train while she was crossing to the up platform to catch a local train to Oxford. On 16 February 2009 another CrossCountry Voyager train had a near miss with someone using Tackley crossing.

The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) found that the immediate cause of the 2008 fatality was that Mrs Evans stepped into the path of the express train. However, the RAIB also identified a problem with the ""decision point"", i.e. the place at which a user would decide where to cross relative to the track and identified WODC's refusal of planning permission for an alternative, safer crossing as an ""underlying factor"" in the accident.

Closure of crossing
The crossing was eventually closed in April 2020, replaced by a temporary footbridge at the Banbury end of the platform.",2024-11-21,"['Railway stations in Oxfordshire' 'DfT Category F2 stations'

773,27810,75749684,15076,Danish–Hanseatic War (1361–1370),"The Danish–Hanseatic War (1361–1370) was both a trade and territorial conflict mainly between the Kingdom of Denmark, led by King Valdemar IV, and the Hanseatic League, the latter of which was led by the rich and powerful merchant city of Lübeck. Though the first few years of the war resulted in several Danish victories, and even led to a beneficial truce for Denmark in 1365, the Hanseatic League, furious at the terms of the truce, resumed hostilities along with several allies and managed to defeat the Danes.

Though initiated by the Danish conquest of Gotland, the war quickly spread to encompass all territories where Denmark and the Hansa had conflicting claims. Scania and the Oresund, along with several coastal ports belonging to the Danish ally of Norway, were attacked and raided, and even the Danish capital of Copenhagen was ransacked. The resulting treaty, signed at Stralsund, secured the Hanseatic League's position as a great power in Northern Europe.

The Danish–Hanseatic War is split into two parts, one part starting with the Danish conquest of Gotland and ending with the Treaty of Vordingborg, which secured a tenuous truce between the combatants. The second part starts with the Hanseatic League's resumption of hostilities against Denmark and ending with the Treaty of Stralsund in 1370.

 Background 
By 1361, the Hanseatic League had been the uncontested hegemon over the Baltic Sea for several years. German settlers colonized various parts of Prussia and Livonia, establishing settlements such as Riga. These towns and cities controlled trade through various means, and profited off of the lucrative Baltic trade. They also collectively worked together to eliminate piracy throughout the Baltic as well, which previously made trade in the region difficult.

Also important to the Hanseatic League were the fisheries of Scania. According to French Crusader Philippe de Mézières, there were around  300,000 people fishing throughout Scania. The region was also an important distribution center for goods transferring from the Baltic to the North Sea, for the Oresund passed between Scania and the Danish island of Sjælland.

The Hanseatic League had been granted several privileges in Scania by the Kingdom of Sweden, and as such the region was extremely profitable for the League. Lots of German merchants lived in Scania and multiple cities in the area were settled by those willing to fish.Skånemarknaden Archived 2013-04-18 at archive.today. Terra Scaniae, 2007. In Swedish. Retrieved 27 August 2008. In 1360 however, Valdemar IV reconquered Scania, securing the region under Danish rule instead of Swedish rule. Though Valdemar IV allowed the Hanseatic League to keep their privileges in the region, it came at a high cost.

 First Phase (1361–1365) 

Valdemar, who had just managed to stabilize his kingdom after the catastrophic reign of Christopher II, had ambitions to further expand his Danish realm to become a new northern great power. In 1361, Valdemar launched an invasion on the island of Gotland.

Gutnish militia attempted to fend off the invasion, but they stood little chance against Valdemar's experienced army of mercenaries. On July 27, 1361, the Danish army crushed the Gutnish army in the Battle of Visby. Visby, the largest and most prominent city on the island, surrendered to Valdemar, paying a huge sum of tribute in order to prevent a sacking. With Visby under Danish control, the entire island was de facto under Danish rule.

The city of Visby, which had been for many years one of the most important trading posts in the Baltic Sea, was one of the most important Hanseatic ports there was at the time. Though Valdemar IV was willing to renew the cities Hanseatic charter, his expansion was still nonetheless viewed as aggressive by the Hanseatic League, and a diet of both Wendish and Pomeranian cities decided to suspend diplomatic and commercial relations with Denmark, and eventually declared war on the Danes, along with their allies of Sweden and Norway

However, many members of the Hanseatic League did not fully participate in the war effort. Though the League was attempting a blockade on Denmark to stifle their economy, many members of league still traded with Denmark. The Dutch and Teutonic cities in particular were guilty of this, as despite providing financial subsidies to the Hansa, still continued trade with the Danish. As a result, the Hanseatic blockade proved ineffective, and the burden of the war fell upon the Wendish towns.

In April 1362, the commander of the Hanseatic fleet, Johann Wittenborg of Lubeck, landed his fleet of around 50 ships, 27 of which being cogs, in Helsingborg. His army went on foot to siege the city, but this proved to be a major mistake. Valdemar took the opportunity and attacked the Hanseatic navy, and succeeded in capturing 12 ships in the ensuing Battle of Helsingborg. Wittenborg successfully secured an armistice and fled, though he was eventually executed for his failures.

With this defeat, the Hanseatic League was seriously crippled. Though plans were made about a potential second expedition to attack Denmark, they resulted in nothing concrete. Three years of uneasy peace followed, and many of the Wendish towns who were still in the war bickered with one another over funding. It seemed like the Hanseatic League could potentially collapse at this very moment.

 Second Phase (1367–1370) 
Despite multiple setbacks, the Hanseatic League managed to stay together. In 1366, a Hanseatic diet convened in Lubeck managed to keep the Kontores under control by granting the citizens full control over them. This kept most Hanseatic ports under control. More importantly, Valdemar IV, despite his successes in the beginning of the war, proved inept at ending the conflict. Instead of sowing discord between the Hanseatic states, Valdemar instead harassed Prussian vessels and merchants in the Oresund. Valdemar also adopted a hostile attitude towards the Dutch cities as well. These actions helped create an alliance between the Wendish cities, the Prussian cities, and the Dutch cities. Multiple other Hanseatic towns from various regions agreed to a formal military alliance, known as the Confederation of Cologne.

The Confederation, bolstered by alliances with Sweden, Mecklenburg, and Holstein, resumed hostilities against Valdemar, who now also had to deal with rebellious nobility. The Danish king fled Denmark in an attempt find potential allies, while Henning Podebusk was appointed drost of Denmark in the absence of Valdemar, yet Valdemar was unable to find any allies. Wendish ships raided the Danish and Norwegian coasts (Norway had joined the conflict on Denmark's side as King Haakon VI was the son-in-law of Valdemar), and the blockades on Norwegian ports in particular led to Norway's withdrawal from the war. Copenhagen was sacked by the Hanseatic fleet, with its port damaged beyond use for the remainder of the war. Swedish armies were sieging down Scania, being mostly successful except at Lindholmen. The Count of Holstein meanwhile marched his men throughout Jutland. When Helsingborg was captured in September, 1369, the Danish council sued for peace, and the Treaty of Stralsund was negotiated in the following year.

 Legacy 
The treaty that concluded the war greatly benefited the Hanseatic League. Though the League had the chance to push for harsher terms, they instead were content with confirming charters that were already set. German merchants in Scania were no longer to be tolled, and free trade was to be enforced. More important was the acquisition of four key forts (Malmo, Helsingborg, Skanor and Falsterbo), which granted the Hanseatic League complete de facto control over the Oresund. The Hansa was also granted two-thirds of the revenue from the forts, and the Hanseatic League would also be granted the privilege of having a say in the Danish royal election.

The war proved that the Hanseatic League was capable of militarily challenging foes by raising its own armies and navies. It had directed much of the war's operations on their own and had shown that it was a force to be reckoned with. In the aftermath of the war, the Hanseatic League became the one of the most powerful groups in Northern Europe, and despite not being a united entity in any way, it was united in their defense of trade and their mercantile hegemony.

The Cologne Confederation would last under 1385, and the Hanseatic League itself would continue to be a major player in Northern European affairs. However, Denmark would not forget its defeat in the war. Along with Sweden and Norway, both of which worried of the growing German influence pushing into Scandinavia, Denmark would go on to ratify the Kalmar Union, which itself would be a major competitor of the Hanseatic League and a major factor in its eventual decline by the 17th century.",2025-04-03,"['Wars involving the Hanseatic League' 'Wars involving Lübeck'

774,31216,5335253,5558,Intervertebral foramen,"The intervertebral foramen (also neural foramen) (often abbreviated as IV foramen or IVF) is an opening between (the intervertebral notches of) two pedicles (one above and one below) of adjacent vertebra in the articulated spine. Each intervertebral foramen gives passage to a spinal nerve and spinal blood vessels, and lodges a posterior (dorsal) root ganglion. Cervical, thoracic, and lumbar vertebrae all have intervertebral foramina.

 Anatomy 

 Structure 
In the thoracic region and lumbar region, each vertebral foramen is additionally bounded anteriorly by (the inferior portion of) the body of vertebra (particularly in the thoracic region) and adjacent intervertebral disc (particularly in the lumbar region).

In the cervical region, a small part of the body of vertebra inferior to the intervertebral disc also forms the anterior boundary of the IVF (due to the fact that the junction of the pedicle with the body of vertebra is situated somewhat more inferiorly on the body).

 Contents 
A number of structures pass through the IVF: spinal nerve roots, a recurrent meningeal nerve, radicular arteries (where present), segmental medullary arteries (where present), intervertebral veins, and lymphatic vessels.

The posterior (dorsal) root ganglion is situated within the IVF. The adipose tissue of the spinal epidural space extends into the IVF. The spinal dura mater extends laterally with each departing spinal nerve, reaching into the IVF. Transforaminal ligaments (when present) extend through the IFV.

775,28307,75767744,137880,George Leonard Chaney," George Leonard Chaney (1836-1922) was a Boston Unitarian minister who served the city's Hollis Street Church for 15 years. In 1882, at the American Unitarian Association's (A.U.A.) request, he moved to Atlanta to organize the first Unitarian church in that city. As the A.U.A. Southern Superintendent, he was a leader in expanding Unitarianism across the South. He later moved to Richmond, Virginia and established another Unitarian church. In 1895, he retired from his superintendent and ministerial duties and returned to Massachusetts.

Early life
George Leonard Chaney, born in the Massachusetts coastal city of Salem on December 24, 1836, was the fourth and last child of James Chaney (1797-1884) and Harriet Webb Chaney (1803-1900). His siblings included Harriet Webb (1828-1896), Mary Webb (1830-1917), and James Henry (1832-1862).

Chaney's father was a distant descendant of Scottish immigrants who settled in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in the 1600s. The senior Chaney owned a general store that sold a variety of beverages and foods, including rum, brandy, spices, meat, coffee, butter, and general household goods.

In 1823, the senior Chaney briefly partnered with Stephen Haradan in a mercantile enterprise that sold goods to the general public and sailing vessels. After the partnership ended in 1824, he continued in the dry goods business, achieving a degree of success that led him to sell his business to William B. Ashton, an associate, in 1853. Chaney continued in the mercantile business at a reduced scale, now as a wholesaler.

Education
George Leonard Chaney was educated at Salem High School and the Latin Grammar School. Afterward, he continued his education at Harvard College, graduating in 1859 with a Bachelor of Arts. In his senior year, Chaney competed for a Boylston Elocution prize for delivering a five-minute memorized talk in English, Greek, or Latin, placing second in his category. He belonged to several college societies, including the Phi Beta Kappa academic honor society.

Following his graduation, he left Boston and moved to Meadville, Pennsylvania, where he was employed as a tutor. He later entered the nearby Meadville Lombard Theological School, a Unitarian seminary, and graduated with a divinity degree in 1862.

Marriage and Children

In January 1871, Chaney, 35, married Caroline Isabel Carter, 26 (1845-1925) from Leominster, Massachusetts. She was a distant descendant of Rev. Thomas and Mary Carter, early Puritan settlers who arrived in New England in the early 1600s. Over the generations, the Carter family settled throughout New England and New York. One relative, Captain Joseph Oliver Carter (1802-1850), settled in Honolulu. He was a seafaring captain of merchant ships that traded with China, Hawaii, Mexico, Alaska, and California.

The Chaneys had one son, George Carter Chaney, born in November 1871. He was an attorney who married Evadne Hubbard Jewett in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1901. They lived in Salem and had two children, Constance Jewett and Oliver Carter.

Northern Ministry
Chaney's Northern Ministry spanned the years 1862 to 1882.

Hollis Street Church

Not long after he graduated from Meadville Theological Seminary, Boston's Hollis Street Church called the 26-year-old Chaney to their pulpit in 1862.,  This call to the Hollis Street pulpit was Chaney's first pastorate. Reflecting on this period, an 82-year-old Chaney noted, ""A minister's first parish is his real school of preparation for the ministry.”  The imprint of this first pastorate is seen in his future endeavors. Chaney served the Hollis Street Church for 15 years, from 1862 to 1877.

Historic Church
Founded in 1732 as a Congregationalist church, in 1800, the Hollis Street Church realigned with the newly emerging Unitarian movement. Chaney followed notable Unitarian ministers such as Horace Holley (1809-1818), Rev. John Pierpont (1819-1845), and Rev. Starr King (1848-1860). King, a forceful and tireless orator, left Boston to become the pastor of the First Unitarian Church in San Francisco, California. King died unexpectedly at age 40 in 1864.

Chaney was the recipient of the church's gravitas and the prestige of its former ministers.  Boston's most distinguished Unitarian ministers performed his ordination ceremony in October 1862. Attending ministers included Rev. H.W. Foote of King's Chapel, who offered Chaney the Right Hand of Fellowship, Rev. F. H. Hedge from Brookline, who delivered a sermon, Rev. William Newell of Cambridge, who gave the ordination prayer, and Rev. Edward E. Hale of South Congregational Church who charged the incoming pastor.

Chaney's circle of influential Unitarian ministers grew during his Hollis Street ministry. In August 1864, two years after his ordination, Chaney offered the Right Hand of Fellowship during the ordination of another new minister, Rev. Francis E. Abbott. Again, Rev. Edward E. Hale and Rev. Henry W. Foote were present. Other Unitarian ministers, including Rev. James Freeman Clarke and Rev. William P. Tilden, also participated.

Later that same year, in December, Chaney again joined Tilden and Hale at the ordination of Rev. Horatio Alger, Jr., when he became the pastor of the Unitarian Church in Brewster, Massachusetts.

Later, Alger became a famous author of popular “rags-to-riches” young adult novels.

Challenges to a New Ministry
Chaney faced three challenges at the start of his Hollis Street ministry. First, he was filling a pulpit that his predecessor, Rev. Starr King, had vacated two and a half years earlier. His society needed “shepherding” to a new ministry—a shepherding made difficult by his second challenge. Some at the church hoped that the beloved Starr King would soon return and attempted to preserve his church customs and practices. The third challenge was the American Civil War (1861-1865), which drew the church into an unfolding national tragedy. Chaney noted that the war changed the church's primary concern from its members to “the soldiers and the freedman.”

Civil War Years
In October 1863, Chaney hosted Rev. Rufus Stebbins, the president of the American Unitarian Association (1862-1865), at his Hollis Street Church. Rev Stebbins described the Association's missionary work to the U.S. Federal army, which consisted of distributing thousands of religious tracts and visits by Unitarian ministers.

Two months later, in December 1863, under the auspices of the United States Sanitary Commission, Chaney served as a minister in an army hospital following the Battle of Fredericksburg.  The Sanitary Commission, created at the start of the war to care for sick and wounded Federal soldiers, was led by a fellow Harvard graduate and Unitarian minister, Rev. Henry W. Bellows.

Chaney joined other Boston Unitarian ministers in the 1864 U.S. presidential election, delivering supportive sermons for the Union and Abraham Lincoln. The Boston Evening Transcript reported that the sermons “may rightly be classed in the front rank of ministerial efforts. As in the day of the Revolution, the pulpit thunders against traitors and oppressors.” A few months later, in April 1865, Chaney delivered an impassioned eulogy for the assassinated U.S. President Lincoln from the same pulpit from which he had endorsed him.

Chapel Dedicated
In December 1864, Chaney was joined by Rev. Edward Hale, Rev. William Tilden, Rev. G.H. Hepworth, and other Boston Unitarian ministers in the dedication of the newly erected Hollis Street Chapel. The two-story brick chapel provided seating for 300 people on the lower floor, a minister's office, a committee room, and a large hall for church programs on the upper floor. One such program was the church's sewing circle. This room would later be utilized for Chaney's woodworking manual education program.

National Conference of Unitarian and Other Christian Churches
Also in 1864, Unitarian leaders sought to bring about a foundational change to the organizational structure of the American Unitarian Association. Chaney's participation in this reorganization further positioned him as an influential denominational leader.

The American Unitarian Association, formed in 1825, was an association of individuals and thus exerted limited influence over Unitarian churches. As a result, churches had little interest in the A.U.A.’s operations or missionary work.

However, the American Civil War caused leading Unitarians in Chaney's circle of ministerial colleagues, such as Rev. Henry W. Bellows and Rev. Edward Everett Hale, to reconsider the potential missionary impact of the Association. They concluded that the Association needed to broaden its organizational structure beyond just ministers.

The initial steps of that restructuring took place on December 7, 1864, at Chaney's Hollis Street Church.  At that meeting, the A.U.A. Executive Committee proposed creating an organizational structure involving Unitarian churches in the denomination's decision-making body. Known as the National Conference of Unitarian and Other Christian Churches—churches would be the legislative body operating under the control of the A.U.A.’s Executive Committee.

Five months later, in April 1865, a convention was convened in New York City. Churches were represented by their pastor and two lay delegates. Chaney attended as the Hollis Street cleric representative.

Although designated as a “national conference,” only 11 clusters or conferences were initially organized in just five states: Delaware, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.  The Boston-based Suffolk Conference held its organizational meetings at the Hollis Street Church. Hale was the president and Chaney was the conference secretary for several years.

""What is a Unitarian?"" Controversy
The formation of the National Conference sparked an unexpected and heated debate over the question, “What did it mean to be Unitarian?”

The debate achieved no broad consensus, resulting two years later, in 1867, with the organization of the Free Religious Association (FRA). The FRA sought to go beyond the boundaries of Christianity to which mainstream Unitarians were closely tied. The Free Religious Association existed until 1917. Chaney aligned with the mainstream ministers and remained committed to the Christian core of Unitarianism.

Hollis Street Retains Chaney as its Minister
The Hollis Street Church proprietors, known today as the Board of Trustees, recognized the growing influence of the young minister they had called to the pulpit three years earlier. In October 1865, they increased Chaney's ministerial salary by $500.

Chaney's rising profile within Unitarianism did not go unnoticed. In May 1866, the First Parish Unitarian Church in Providence, Rhode Island, extended an offer to Chaney to fill the pulpit recently vacated by the late Rev. E.B. Hall.

First Parish Unitarian Church offered Chaney a yearly salary of $6,000, which was $2,000 more than his current remuneration. Chaney nonetheless declined the offer. His decision gratified the Hollis Street Church parishioners and his “many friends” in Boston. The Boston Evening Transcript reported “that he cannot be spared from the position of great usefulness which he now so acceptably fills.”

Chaney's decision to decline the First Parish call may have been related to his planned trip to Europe the following month. However, it may also be reasonably speculated that Chaney's decision was influenced by his long-term career aspirations within the Unitarian denomination.

A move from Boston to Providence, only 50 miles south, would remove him from the center of Unitarian denominational decision-making. In just a few years, he had gone from a newly ordained minister to a well-connected and valued member of Boston's Unitarian leadership. He was only 30 years old and had much of his career ahead of him.

Trip to Europe
At the American Civil War's end, Chaney traveled to Europe in June 1866 for a three-month vacation. During his absence, the Hollis Street Church was closed for renovations. No information on his itinerary or traveling companions, if any, has been found.

Charitable Work
In an era before government-supported social programs, churches played a significant role in aiding the indigent. Boston's Unitarian ministers considered charity work as part of their broader ministry. Noting that Christian charity was “less Sunday work than the work of everyday life.” Chaney reflected this ethic.

Flower Mission
Chaney's church had a central role in a charitable program called the Flower Mission.  Started in England, the Flower Mission was adopted in Boston in 1869. Per the tradition, people gathered flowers and fruit for the sick and poor. Chaney offered the Hollis Street Church as a distribution hub. The Flower Mission was an ecumenical effort among Boston's churches.

Hollis Street Church Board of Charities
In 1867, Chaney instituted an assistance program overseen by the church's Board of Charities. Per the program, if church members encountered an individual seeking alms, they were to direct that person to the church where they would be registered and receive needed support. Chaney remarked that “he did not know of any better system than this for the distribution of aid.”

Benevolent Fraternity of Churches
Chaney's Hollis Street Church was a member of Boston's Benevolent Fraternity of Churches. Organized in 1834 by Boston's Unitarian ministers, it coordinated charitable work among its members. It was also a mutual support structure for the ministers of the participating churches.

As the Hollis Street Church minister, Chaney was the president of his church's delegation from 1871 to 1878. Upon leaving his pastorate, his successor, Rev. Henry Bernard Carpenter, became the president of the church's delegation in 1879.

Hospital Sunday
In February 1874, Chaney was among those who advocated that the Unitarian Suffolk Conference of Churches adopt a collective charitable giving program called Hospital Sunday. Hospital Sunday originated in Birmingham, England in 1859. The Boston churches modeled their program on its English antecedent. Churches designated one Sunday a year to collect funds for local hospitals.

Other Charitable Work
Chaney personally participated in other charitable organizations.
He served on the Executive Committee for Boston's Discharged Soldiers’ Home. The home operated as a private charity from 1862 to 1869, providing housing for Union veterans. 
He was the keynote speaker at the 1865 annual Seaman's Widow and Orphan Association meeting. He would have been familiar with this association, organized in his hometown of Salem, Massachusetts, in 1834.  
He served on committees for the Boston Soldiers’ Memorial Society, organized in 1865 to honor Massachusetts's Union soldiers. 
He was on the Board of Instruction for the Boston School for the Ministry, organized by Rev. George H. Hepworth in 1867. This group encouraged young men “of ability but no means” to enter the Christian ministry. 
He was on the Executive Committee for the Suffolk Union for Christian Work. Organized in Boston in 1868, the Union provided charitable services to the city's “needy and destitute.”

Industrial Education
Aside from his charitable work, Chaney was well-recognized for his advocacy of industrial education. He considered industrial education essential for the “development of body, mind, and soul.”  For Chaney, charity's focus was not only on providing immediate sustenance but also offering the means for individuals to support themselves. Speaking at his Hollis Street Church in 1869, Chaney explained his philosophy on charity and education.

Whittling School - Initial Program
Around 1866, Chaney inaugurated his Hollis Street Chapel woodworking school for boys. The woodworking school was designed to showcase the benefits and cost-efficiency of a manual training program. Since acceptance into the woodworking classes required prior attendance at a Sunday School class, the workshop provided further church engagement with lower-class youth, often referred to as newsboys or street urchins.

Frank T. Roswell, a local business owner, was the school's supervisor. The school consisted of 24 boys working on movable benches with glue, brads, and jack-knives to carve or whittle empty wooden cigar boxes into “pretty wooden panels.”  Publicly, the program was derisively known as the Hollis Street Whittling School—a name Chaney adopted.

Chaney and Roswell understood that the whittling school was not an industrial educational program. It was a vehicle to demonstrate the benefits of low-cost manual training instruction, a precursor to the formal training of skilled artisans.  The strategic aim of the Whittling School was to secure funding for introducing such programs in the public school system.

Whittling School - Later Program
Five years later, in 1871, a revamped woodworking program was unveiled. The school upgraded its equipment to fixed benches, a more extensive array of woodworking tools, and facilities for each student to secure their tools. Frank Roswell continued as the school supervisor.

The Whittling School also formally revamped its organizational structure. The school was organized under the guise of the Industrial School Association. The Association was composed of “public-spirited” individuals who shared Chaney's vision of adopting such training in the public school system. Chaney was the Association's president.

Chaney had created what would now be called a “turnkey” solution for a public school to adopt. The program included a manual of woodshop lessons, a new location, and an offer to public schools to defray expenses if they adopted the program.

At a special meeting of the Boston School Board in April 1878, Chaney, along with other supporters, presented this industrial school model, sharing that the Industrial School Association had “perfected a plan for educating boys in the use of mechanical tools.”

Two principals from Boston schools offered their endorsement. Professor Whittaker from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, established in 1861, also spoke approvingly. The special school board committee indicated that they would consider the “matter” and report at a later date.

Four years later, in 1882, the Boston School Board approved Chaney's petition that $500 be appropriated to adopt “hand-training” in one of its schools.

Florida Travel
In March 1870, Chaney received permission from the Hollis Street Trustees to temporarily vacate the pulpit for health reasons. He resided in Florida until his health was restored. He returned to the pulpit in May.

Chaney Attempts to End his Pastorate
In 1875, thirteen years into his Hollis Street ministry, Chaney shared with the church's proprietors that he wished to end his pastorate. Citing the area's changing demographics, Chaney concluded that it was no longer possible to maintain Hollis Street as a family church.  The proprietors persuaded Chaney to continue his ministry. They, however, made a substantial concession to Chaney, granting him a ten-month leave of absence starting in December so that he could travel, including a visit to the Hawaiian Islands, then known as the Sandwich Islands.

Hawaiian Travel
In January 1876, Chaney, his wife Caroline, and their five-year-old son traveled to the Hawaiian Islands for a four-month visit. Upon their arrival in Honolulu, they were hosted by Caroline's cousin, Henry Alpheus Pierce (HAP) Carter. HAP Carter was the son of Captain Joseph Oliver Carter, the family's Pacific seafaring merchant captain.

Chaney memorialized this Hawaiian visit four years later in his book Alo’ ha! A Hawaiian Salutation. The book was a travel log, including commentary on Chaney's interactions with locals, expats, and Christian missionaries.

His reflections on the impact of 50 years of Christian missionary work on the local Hawaiian population revealed the centrality that Chaney positioned Christianity as the desired social and moral foundation for society.  He wrote
Since Chaney's steamer ship, the Granada, served Sydney, Honolulu, and San Francisco, it is reasonably assumed that he visited San Francisco's Universalist church and the gravesite of Rev. Starr King on the church grounds. Upon the Chaneys' return to the United States, they visited the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. Little else is known of their travel itinerary.

Chaney resumed his Hollis Street pastoral duties in October 1876.

End of Hollis Street Church Pastorate
A year later, in October 1877, the Hollis Street Church proprietors formally accepted Chaney's resignation. The proprietors thanked Chaney for his 15 years of service, expressed their “admiration of his Christian character,” and their regret for the circumstances that “could not be controlled” that compelled his departure.

Chaney's earlier observations about the viability of Hollis Street as a family church were prescient. In 1884, seven years after his resignation, the final religious service was held in the church. The church was sold and converted into the Hollis Street Theatre. The theater operated until 1935 when it was closed and demolished.

After Hollis Street Ministry
After resigning from his Hollis Street pastorate, Chaney did not pursue a full-time church ministry. He occasionally preached at various locations.  His longest ministerial engagement lasted six months when he filled the pulpit of Massachusetts's First Parish in Cambridge while its minister, Rev. Francis G. Peabody, traveled in Europe.

He continued to attend annual meetings of the Middlesex Conference and the New York and Hudson River Conference. He published another young man's book, Tom, A Home Story.

In 1879, he spent the summer on his wife's farm in Leominster.

American Unitarian Association's Southern Strategy
In the post-Civil War years, the A.U.A. turned its attention to Southern missionary work. Chaney spent the last half of his career implementing the A.U.A. Southern strategy.

Director on A.U.A. Board of Trustees
From 1872 to 1883, Chaney served on the A.U.A.’s Executive Committee.

The mission of the A.U.A. was to produce union among liberal Christians, publish and distribute literature, and supply missionaries “especially in such parts of the country as are destitute of a stated ministry.”

The Association was organized with an Executive Committee and various standing committees such as Finance, Publication, Theological Education, and other committees with geographic responsibilities such as New England, Middle and Southern, Western and Pacific Coast states, and Foreign Missions.

Chaney served on the Middle and Southern States, Foreign Missions, and Theological Education committees.

A Return to the “What is a Unitarian” Controversy
Chaney was only a witness to the 1865 controversy over the definition of Unitarianism following the formation of the National Conference of Unitarian and Other Christian Churches. Nearly a decade later, Chaney, now a Director of the A.U.A., was a central participant in this resurrected debate.

Due to his responsibility to publish the 1875 Unitarian Yearbook, Chaney was directly involved in the debate on how to define a Unitarian. A standard feature of the Yearbook was a list of Unitarian ministers. Compiling the yearly list of ministers due to its self-reporting feature offered its own challenges. The omission of one minister's name from the previous year's roster re-ignited the debate.

The minister at the center of this debate was Rev. William J. Potter of the First Congregational Society of New Bedford, Massachusetts. Potter, a founder of the Free Religious Association, had made known his position to those preparing the 1874 list of ministers. 

Based on this communication, the preparers of the ministerial list, without Potter's approval, removed his name from the 1874 Yearbook.

As noted earlier, Chaney held a conservative view that Unitarianism was intrinsically tied to Christianity. At the A.U.A. May 1874 business meeting, Chaney offered a motion to establish a standard for inclusion on the annual list of ministers.

Rev. Edward E. Hale seconded Chaney's motion.

The substance of the debate touched on profound issues on the nature of Unitarianism. Was it Christian? Was Unitarianism merely a branch of the Free Religious Association? It was offered that if the Association had stood on its principled position of being Christian, there would never have been a Free Religious Association. There was also a challenge for anyone to bring forth a definition of “Christian” on which all could agree!

A question also arose on jurisdiction. Who had the authority to decide who to include or exclude a name? Did that authority reside within the American Unitarian Association? Some argued that congregationalism gave the Unitarian church, which called a minister, the right to have their minister listed.

After extensive debate, Rev. Hale declared that consensus had been achieved—“Unitarian minister” meant “Unitarian Christian minister”—just as Chaney asserted. Despite this declaration, Potter's name was returned to the list of Unitarian ministers.

The decision to return Potter's name rested on the very liberty offered by Unitarianism. It was observed that Potter had committed no inappropriate offense. He expressed only a different opinion of the nature of Unitarianism. Rev. Dr. John Cordner, an influential Unitarian leader from Montreal, Canada, argued that examining a minister's opinion would be “trampling individual liberty of opinion underfoot.”

Chaney himself opened the door to this decision. The Christian Register reported Chaney's openness to the liberty of an individual to be seen by their actions. “A man who illustrates the temper and spirit of Christianity should be regarded as a Christian.”

Rev. Shippen later offered a lecture entitled “What is a Unitarian?” in which he shared an 1860 quote from Rev. Samuel J. May from New Bedford, Massachusetts
 
In his Southern ministry, Chaney emphasized that he brought a message of authentic Christianity, defined as Unitarian Christianity.

A.U.A. Southern Missionary Efforts
By the mid-1840s, the A.U.A. had decided that its new missionary efforts would be more productive in the West. Subsequently, for decades, scant resources were devoted to Southern missionary efforts. The issue of slavery was also an obstacle that lessened any chance of developing a Boston-based Southern denominational strategy.

That did not mean there were no Southern Unitarian churches.

Independent Antebellum Unitarian Societies
There were a handful of Unitarian societies in the Antebellum South, but they considered themselves independent from the Boston-based A.U.A. These societies saw the Unitarian Church in Charleston, South Carolina, as the center of their home-grown Southern Unitarianism.

The Unitarian Church in Charleston was established in 1817 as the Second Independent or Congregational Church of Charleston. The church was based on English Unitarianism, expressed by Joseph Priestley, and not New England Unitarianism, which emerged from Calvinistic Puritanism. Fifteen years later, in 1832, the church changed its name to the Unitarian Church of Charleston. Rev. Samuel Gilman led the church for four decades.

The Unitarian societies in Augusta and Savannah, Georgia, were founded through Gilman's missionary work and understandably considered Charleston as the locus of their denominational activity.

Boston claimed the Unitarian Society in Mobile, Alabama as one of its auxiliary societies based on 1835 organizational work by Rev. James Freeman Clarke, a Boston-based Unitarian minister. However, Clarke only gathered together Unitarians who had previously been gathered together into a nascent society. This society considered itself to be within the scope of the Charleston-based association.

The Unitarian society in New Orleans, Louisiana, organized by the energetic and fiercely independent Rev. Theodore Clapp, was its own center of Unitarian and Universalist thinking. The church was founded in 1823 initially as a Presbyterian church with Clapp as its pastor.

A decade later, the Presbyterians convicted Clapp of heresy, but his church continued with him. With Clapp in the pulpit, the church underwent a series of name changes, eventually known as The Church of the Messiah in 1855.

Post-War Southern Focus
After the American Civil War, the A.U.A. began having aspirational hope of extending its missionary work to the South. However, funding remained modest. In 1880, three years after the conclusion of Southern Reconstruction, only $270 was allocated for Southern missionary work. In contrast, the A.U.A., in that same year, provided over $6,000 for missionary work in the Western states.

The A.U.A.’s first significant Southern expenditure of several thousand dollars was not a planned investment. Instead, it was an unexpected opportunity to revive the church in New Orleans.

The New Orleans society survived Clapp's resignation in 1856, a series of Unitarian and Universalist ministers, and the Civil War. However, it emerged at the end of Southern Reconstruction heavily in debt. When the mortgage was put up at a public auction, the A.U.A. took advantage of this situation and secured the debt at a reduced rate.

Seed of Chaney's Southern Missionary Work
In early 1881, the A.U.A. started more intentional investment in Southern missionary work by funding two Southern exploratory efforts. Rev. Enoch Powell, who recently served a congregation in New Hampshire, was allocated $100 “for missionary work in Atlanta.” Rev. John W. Heywood was allocated $500 for a more general missionary tour of the South.  Six months after Rev. Powell's initial Atlanta trip, the A.U.A. directors allocated $1,000 for further Atlanta missionary work and requested that Rev. Chaney lead that effort.

Years later, in a personal reflection, Chaney shared,

Southern Ministry
Chaney's Southern Ministry spanned the years 1882 to 1894.

Early Southern Missionary Work
On January 12, 1881, at the start of Powell's Atlanta missionary work, he placed an advertisement in The Atlanta Constitution reading, “Prominent citizens of Atlanta having expressed a desire to organize a Unitarian church.”(bold added) It has been assumed, but not yet documented, that a request from Atlanta initiated this Atlanta Southern missionary work.

Although the Unitarians had no presence in Atlanta, a Universalist church had been organized a year and a half earlier in July 1879. This Universalist society was started by W.C. Bowman, a recent convert to Universalism and later aided by Rev. D.B. Clayton, a seasoned South Carolina Universalist preacher.

By the time Powell arrived in Atlanta, the Universalist church was unraveling. Bowman had resigned, and Clayton considered the continuation of the church to be unsustainable. It has been assumed those seeking to continue the presence of a liberal church in Atlanta reached out to the Boston A.U.A. Directors for assistance.

Unlike Bowman and Clayton, who arrived as itinerant preachers, Powell had the support of Georgia's political elite (to be explained later). He preached his first service in the senate chamber in Atlanta's capitol building, courtesy of Georgia's Governor Alfred Colquitt. Clayton also offered Powell the Orphans’ School Hall, where the Universalists had been holding their services.

Powell may have expressed skepticism about establishing an Atlanta presence, but the A.U.A. Directors were more optimistic. Following Powell's departure, the A.U.A. ran an article in the Atlanta paper indicating it would continue efforts to organize a Unitarian church in the city. The article noted the “distinguishing characteristics” of the denomination included freedom from creeds, its belief in progressive religious life, and devotion to philanthropic endeavors.

After Powell's departure, Rev. John W. Heywood traveled to Atlanta on his more extensive Southern missionary tour and continued conducting services at the Universalist Hall.

Chaney Arrives in Atlanta
Chaney arrived in Atlanta in February 1882. His advertisement in the local paper encouraged Atlantans to hear him preach on “Unitarian Christianity.”  Like Powell, Chaney was offered the senate chamber in the city's capitol building. He preached his first public sermon on Sunday, February 19, 1882, “Man: How Much is the Worth?”  

Even before his Sunday sermon, Chaney's reputation proceeded him. Atlanta's elites welcomed Chaney based on earlier business relationships established between Boston Unitarians and Southern business and political leaders.

Two years earlier, in August 1880, a Boston economist and Unitarian, Edward Atkinson, published a letter in the New York Herald discussing the inefficiencies in Southern cotton production. He offered that formal cooperation between Southern growers and Northern manufacturers could remedy this situation.

Henry W. Grady, the influential editor of The Atlanta Constitution, reprinted the New York Herald's comments. He encouraged others, such as Hannibal Kimball, the Atlanta Cotton Factory president and Georgia Governor Alfred Colquitt, to follow up on Atkinson's ideas. The result was Atlanta's 1881 Cotton Exposition. The Exposition included Aktinson's recommendation to house a 720-feet-long and 400-feet-wide model cotton factory in the main exhibition hall.

Chaney positioned his initial introduction to Atlanta as a continuation of the industrial uplifting begun by Atkinson.

In early February 1882, an article in the Atlanta paper emphasized Chaney's background in industrial education, his interest in schools for whites and freedmen, and his relationship with Atkinson. The article noted that Chaney planned to tour and inspect Atlanta's schools and industries.

Four months later, in June 1882, an interview published in The Atlanta Constitution entitled “Hand Education” further cemented Chaney's public image as an industrial educational advocate. Referred to as the “president of the Industrial Education League” (a.k.a. Industrial School Association), Chaney spoke of his efforts to introduce industrial education in the North and the benefits awaiting the Southland if such schooling was adopted.

Thus, Chaney entered Atlanta society with a degree of “celebrity status.” He was highly educated, well-connected in influential circles in Boston, and welcomed into Atlanta's ruling class.

In 1885, three years after he arrived in Atlanta, Chaney was elected as a Director of Atlanta's Young Men's Library Association (Y.M.L.A.). This paid subscription library association, established in 1867, was initially open only to white men. The policy was updated in 1873 to admit white women. Chaney served on the board of the Y.M.L.A., holding various positions, retiring from the board in 1890 as president.

Having made his introduction to the Atlanta community through his advocacy of industrial education, Chaney then turned his attention to his mission, which was to raise a Unitarian church in the city.

Church of Our Father
Despite his reception by Atlanta's elites, Chaney's initial gathering of his flock was slow and, at times, dispiriting. After a diligent and hopeful search for supporters, only five people attended his first gathering in the small parlor at his Kimball House hotel. Two Sunday services were then held at the Georgia State Senate chambers, attracting crowds of up to seventy people. Chaney attributed the increase in attendance to a mixture of the limited number of his faithful and the “curiosity” of many who came to hear him.

Afterward, services were held for six months in the reception parlor of Concordia Hall, a venue for theatric performances and general meetings. Chaney described this location as a testing ground for his faithful. Located up “two long, wearisome flights of stairs,” attendees were invited into song with the uncertain support of a pianist.

Chaney described this time as “one crying in the wilderness and awakening few responses.”

In the summer of 1882, Chaney returned to Boston. At the request of the American Unitarian Association, he returned in the fall with a determination that if Unitarianism could not find acceptance in Atlanta, the South may be closed to liberal religion.

Services were then held in the U.S. District Courtroom. The fine appointments of the courtroom were a welcomed change from the austerity of the Concordia Hall reception hall. Attendance remained small, but a core fellowship developed.  

In March 1883, approximately a year after he had arrived in Atlanta, 12 people gathered in Chaney's hotel room in the Kimball House, where Chaney announced

With that pronouncement, Atlanta's first Unitarian church,Church of Our Father, was organized.

The mission of the church was 
Shortly afterward, a building committee recommended the purchase of a lot at the corner of Forsyth and Church Streets. With $7,000 in financial assistance from the American Unitarian Association, the lot was purchased from Professor T.E. Means. The lot contained his school building, which Chaney's members used as a temporary meeting location until the construction of their chapel was completed. As Chaney declared, “It was a work of love and faith.”

In April 1884, a chapel was dedicated.  Reflecting Chaney's influential connection to Boston's Unitarian leadership, the church visitor list included Rev. Edward Everett Hale, Rev. R.R. Shippen, Rev. George Thayer, Rev. James Freeman Clarke, and others with whom Chaney had personal and ministerial connections.

Chaney remained pastor of the Church of Our Father until November 1890.

Chaney's November 1890 farewell address reflected the Unitarian Christianity he brought to the South. Unlike orthodox Southern Christianity, which embraced a judgmental God, for Chaney, God was loving. “And the God of love and peace shall be with you.” He added, “In building this church, we have named it the Church of Our Father for Him who went about doing good.”

Chaney's pastorate at the Church of Our Father was diligent but unremarkable. Membership modestly grew. Chaney made no apologies for the relatively small size of his flock, stating

Charitable Work
Also, in his farewell sermon, Chaney preached that as a “church or individuals, we have had a hand in many of the most useful humane enterprises.”

Woman's Exchange, established in early 1884, provided a venue where women could directly sell their wares to the public. This program was closely connected with the Women's Industrial Union.  As Chaney remarked, “alleviating poverty without sacrifice of their just pride.” 
Women's Industrial Union, located near the church and also organized in early 1884, serviced poor white “factory and shop girls” who earned 15 to 20 cents a day. By acquiring basic sewing, cooking, and other skills, these young women could “earn up to 50 to 75 cents a day with really less work.” Chaney's wife, Caroline, served on the executive board of this organization.  
Industrial Home, located just two blocks from the church, was also established in 1884 as a social program to uplift poor white “street girls” by teaching them practical skills in sewing, cooking, washing, and “various arts of housewifery.” The girls were paid in tickets worth two to eight cents a day, which they could redeem at the end of the week at the program's commissary.  
Home for the Friendless, established in 1888, this organization maintained a building to “furnish a home and support to destitute and friendless women and children.”

Industrial Education
Chaney also reprised the industrial education efforts that he had doggedly pursued in Boston. In February 1884, the Artisans’ Institute was established, with several members from the Church of Our Father serving on the board of directors or as instructors.   Unlike Chaney's Whittling School, the Artisans’ Institute had a multi-discipline curriculum, including metal working, mechanical drawing, and woodworking. Forty men, who typically had daytime employment, enrolled in the second evening term of instruction.  It appears the school ceased operations in early 1886.

However, Chaney's Southern missionary work was not to establish charities or grow a single Unitarian church. His more ambitious agenda was establishing a Boston-centric Unitarian presence throughout the Southland.

Southern Conference of Unitarian and Other Christian Churches
Chaney, as he had planned, took advantage of the attendance of Southern and Northern ministers at the dedication of the Church of Our Father in April 1884 and chaired an organizational meeting of the Southern Conference of Unitarian and other Christian Churches. With this work, Chaney replicated the conference structure he had helped establish in the mid-1860s during his pastorate at the Hollis Street Church.

The Southern Conference's constitution stated its purpose.

Chaney provided the leadership for Unitarianism Southern extension work and access to his network of influential individuals from the American Unitarian Association in Boston. Rev. Rush R. Shippen, with whom Chaney served on the board of the American Unitarian Association, attended the dedication and organizational meeting.

Eight months later, in January 1885, the Southern Conference held its first post-organizational meeting in Charleston, South Carolina. Chaney represented Atlanta along with other Southern ministers from Charleston and New Orleans. Reflecting Chaney's standing within the A.U.A., Rev. Grindall Allen, the Secretary of the A.U.A., traveled from Boston to attend.

The conference was well covered in the Charleston News and Courier. The paper, maybe reflecting hometown pride, correctly asserted Charleston's historical significance in Unitarianism in the pre-Civil War era when it wrote, “The mother church at Charleston entertained the younger churches with characteristic hospitality.”  (bold added)

The annual conference rotated to different cities where local newspapers exposed Unitarianism to the public. Rotating the venue allowed Southern ministers and visiting ministers an opportunity to build personal relationships.

In 1916, Chaney reflected on the formidable odds he faced in the formation of the Southern Conference. Success, he confessed, required “more make-believe than reality at the start.” Charleston and New Orleans exited but were “a continent apart.” Louisville, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. were already associated with other conferences. “What was the wherewith,” Chaney lamented,” to make a Southern Conference?”

Though Chaney's 1916 reflection outlined the broad obstacles the expansion of Unitarianism faced in the South, a contemporary 1895 account by Rev. Henry A. Westall, a conference circuit rider, observed the sobering obstacles Unitarianism faced in the South. He commented on the 
“harsh and stony ground” Unitarian ministers faced, adding, ""Nowhere is it a holiday task to plant a Unitarian church in the South.”

Southerners were raised on a religious orthodoxy grounded on an angry God, a fallen man, and an ever-waiting inferno of eternal damnation. For Southerners, Unitarianism was “exotic” and “not native” to the Southland. For these reasons, Chaney's liberal religion, despite its compelling gospel of two commandments, “love to God and love to man,” was to be avoided.

Despite headwinds, the Southern Conference grew of 14 Unitarian societies extending from Virginia to Florida and stretching westward to Texas. Many of these societies had branches of the Southern Alliance Association. A women's organization within the Southern Conference designed to “quicken the life of Unitarian churches” and bring women together for “missionary and denominational work.”   The Alliance also maintained a Post Office Mission to distribute Unitarian literature.

Southern Superintendent
In 1890, the A.U.A. appointed Chaney as its Southern Superintendent, a position he held for six years until he resigned in 1896.

Chaney traveled widely in the Southern states, first from his home in Atlanta and later from Richmond, Virginia.

Chaney's annual reports to the A.U.A. provided a snapshot of Southern Unitarianism in the closing decade of the nineteenth century. Chaney reported that the Unitarian Church in Charleston, South Carolina, which had survived the Civil War, had just built a new parish home for its minister. His church in Atlanta, beset by unexpected taxation for city improvements, would benefit from an infusion of $2,000. The Asheville church was looking for a new minister after Rev. F.W. Sanders took a position on the editorial staff of the Unity periodical in Chicago.

Chaney expressed optimism about the extension work in Texas, noting the organization of a society in San Antonio by Rev. W. Schultz. There was additional progress in the state, with Rev. E. M. Wheelock increasing his flock in Austin and Rev. F. Preston preaching regularly in Galveston.

Chaney also commented on obstacles and setbacks. Work in Florida was hampered by the recent retirement of Rev. J.C. Gibson due to the reduction of financial support for his missionary work. Chaney noted opportunities in Pensacola, Tampa, and Jacksonville awaited “a Unitarian ministry.”

Cheney traveled throughout his Southern region to help cultivate new societies. He visited Highlands, North Carolina, and Greenville, South Carolina, “where Unitarian circles have been formed.”  He also offered Southern churches counsel, advice and, when needed, temporarily supplied the pulpit for churches that lost their minister through illness or retirement.

Chaney concluded his 1893 report with optimism and a warning of missed opportunities.
  
A year later, in 1894, Chaney noted the progress in forming new societies and the health of existing societies, citing Unitarian churches in Baltimore, Chattanooga, Louisville, St. Louis, New Orleans, and Richmond, where Chaney was also serving as the local minister. Chaney added that the “germ of a Unitarian Church” could be found in Memphis.

He again lamented that progress was impeded by lack of funding and ministers.

Two years later, in 1896, Rev. George Batchelor, Secretary of the A.U.A., attempted to allay concerns about the future of the overall superintendency system. He insisted that the superintendency system “has not failed” but conceded that financial assistance to dependent churches would be “gradually and judiciously discontinued” due to the lack of funds.   He went on to report that recent vacancies created by resignations would not be filled. Among those resignations was Chaney's. Chaney alluded to this lack of funding for his Southern-dependent churches as a factor in his resignation.

The Southern Unitarian Journal

In 1893, soon after being appointed as the Southern Superintendent, Chaney began publishing a monthly journal entitled the Southern Unitarian. The journal, printed in Atlanta, was the official publication of the Southern Conference of Unitarian and Other Churches.

The Conference president, John Y. Dixon, wrote in the January 1893 inaugural edition that this monthly journal was not “strictly speaking” a business adventure but was primarily dedicated to uniting the widely scattered Southern churches.

The editorial staff included Chaney, Rev. William Roswell Cole, who had assumed the pulpit at the Church of Our Father upon Chaney's resignation, Rev. H.A. Whitman from Charleston, South Carolina, and lay members including John Dixon and Arthur Jones. Chaney's wife, Caroline, contributed monthly reports on the activities of the women's Southern Alliance, of which she was president.

The paper ceased publication in December 1895 after publishing three complete volumes.

Richmond
In response to a request from Richmond residents for assistance in forming a Unitarian church, in late 1892, Chaney moved from Atlanta to Richmond, Virginia. Chaney, still the Southern Superintendent, started to conduct services in the parlors of supporting members. By November 1892, services were held in Belvedere Hall, a well-known entertainment center.

Within a year, steps were taken to organize a Unitarian society in the city. On December 31, 1893, after Sunday service, a business meeting was held where Chaney called upon interested individuals to step forward and sign the membership book. Eighteen members did so.

Chaney continued serving the newly formed society as its pastor until the fall of 1894. At that time, Rev. Joseph M. Seaton, a recent graduate of the Meadville Theological Seminary, assumed the pulpit. Although both Seaton and Chaney were listed as the church's pastors, Chaney significantly reduced his pastoral duties and refocused on his duties as the Southern Superintendent.

Although contemporary accounts stated that Chaney's society was the first Unitarian presence in Richmond, those accounts were not entirely accurate. As early as 1824, several Northern Unitarian ministers had visited and preached in Richmond. Six years later, in 1830, John Bovee Dods, a Congregationalist pastor from Levant, Maine, organized local Richmond citizens into the Unitarian-Universalist Society of Richmond. Members asked Dobs to become their minister, but he declined and returned to Maine.

Rev. John Budd Pitkin, also from Maine, accepted the offer to become the church's pastor.   Pitkin was more Universalist than Unitarian but ministered to his mixed flock. The church later changed its name to the First Independent Church of Richmond.

Growth was stymied by financial pressures and a succession of transient ministers. In early 1835, Pitkin moved to Florida in an unsuccessful effort to recovery health. Rev. Edwin Hubbell Chapin from New York State served the church form 1838 to 1840. The Richmond City Directory listed the church building as empty form 1850 to 1851. The American Civil War further accelerated the church's decline. By 1874, the First Independent Church ceased to exist as a church.

Tuskegee Institute
Shortly after he arrived in Atlanta in 1882, Chaney established a relationship with Booker T. Washington, the principal of the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. Within a year, in 1883, Chaney was on the Institute's Board of Trustees.

Founded in 1881 by an act of the Alabama state legislature, the Tuskegee Institute was then known as the Negro Normal School for Colored Teachers in Tuskegee. The mission of a normal school was to train teachers. Washington was educated at Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute. Upon graduation, Samuel C. Armstrong, the school's founder and principal, recommended the then 25-year-old Washington for the position in Tuskegee.

Chaney's initial appointment to the board resulted from a recommendation made by J.F.B. Marshall, the long-time treasurer of the Hampton school.  Marshall's recommendation noted Chaney's philanthropic interests and influential standing in the American Unitarian Association. Washington, who was required to be a prolific fundraiser, would have recognized Chaney as a valuable asset.

Chaney had long been acquainted with Marshall and the Hampton school. In 1870,
during Chaney's pastorate at Hollis Street and his involvement in industrial education, Marshall invited Chaney to visit the school in Hampton.  Chaney said of his visit that “as an industrial school, it was a model one in every respect.”

Chaney's relationship with Washington and his institute took on many forms. At the school's second anniversary, Chaney delivered the dedication address for Porter Hall, a multi-purpose building housing a chapel, recitation rooms, a library, and a men's dormitory.  Chaney frequently accompanied Washington at his fund-raising events in Boston, delivered commencement addresses, and attended other events at the school.

Chaney continued his relationship with Tuskegee long after he retired from ministry and returned home to Massachusetts. He served on the board of trustees from 1883 to 1904.

Atlanta University
Chaney also established a relationship with Edmund Asa Ware, the President of Atlanta University. Atlanta University, since 1988 known as Clark Atlanta University, was started in 1862 by James Tate and Grandison Daniels, two ex-slaves, to provide education to Atlanta's African American children. It was formally organized in 1865, with Ware becoming president two years later.

Chaney was elected to the University's Board of Trustees in 1885.  He resigned in 1888.

In an 1882 interview with The Atlanta Constitution, where Chaney emphasized his industrial training expertise, he mentioned Ware and the work of the University to educate the South's freedmen. His comments reflected his educational expectations of formerly enslaved people in the closing decades of the 19th century.  

Also, in that interview, Chaney reinforced his public perception of being a conduit to “Northern money.” Remarking on Ware's desire to implement a department for “practical education,” Chaney added

A decade later, in 1898, when W.E.B. DuBois joined the faculty of Atlanta University, this singular focus on manual education was challenged. Dubois's advocacy for higher educational expectations sharply contrasted with Washington's and Chaney's manual training vision. DuBois called for higher education opportunities for the “Talented Tenth” of his race and argued that Washington's “doctrine has tended to make the whites, North and South, shift the Negro problem to the Negro's shoulders . . . when in fact the burden belongs to the nation.”

By the time of this debate, Chaney had already returned to his home in Massachusetts.

Retirement
Following his resignation as the A.U.A. Southern Superintendent in 1896, Chaney and his wife Caroline retired to Salem, Massachusetts, Chaney's hometown. Though they lived in Salem, they frequently spent a part of the winter in Florida or Jamaica and the summers on his wife's farm in Leominster, Massachusetts.

Chaney only occasionally preached and appeared content to tend to his garden and writings.

In 1915, Chaney and his wife traveled again to Atlanta to attend the dedication of the third Unitarian church built in that city. The dedication was most poignant for the Chaneys. The new building included a large stained-glass window known as the Founders’ Windows.   On the windows was a dedication inscription that read, “In honor of George Leonard Chaney . . . Caroline Isabel Chaney.”

This Unitarian church building changed owners several times and was finally razed in the 1970s. However, the stained-glass windows were preserved. Sections of the Founders’ Windows are now on display at the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Atlanta and the Northwest Unitarian Universalist Congregation in Sandy Springs, Georgia.

Theology
George Leonard Chaney considered himself a Christian and believed that Unitarianism embodied Christianity. Unitarianism, he declared, was “the new Protestantism” as it was a reform from within Christianity, not a revolt from outside Christianity.  However, Chaney's Christianity differed significantly from orthodox Southern Christianity.

Unitarianism was “pure Christianity"", the Christianity taught by Jesus and his apostles. The contours of this “pure Christianity” were explained by Rev. Rush R. Shippen, the American Unitarian Association's Board Secretary, in his 1875 Executive Summary delivered at the 15th annual meeting of the Association.  

Chaney's Unitarianism was an affirming faith holding an optimistic view of humankind that was capable of failing to achieve its spiritual aspirations but equally capable of rising up and trying again.

Chaney's Unitarianism believed in a loving God. Rev. H.A. Whitman, the minister in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1896, described the contrast between the God of orthodox Christianity, the “God of Moses,” and the God of Unitarianism, the “God of Jesus.”  “One is a despotic tribal deity, jealous, and cruel; the other is the loving Father of all.”

Unitarians rejected several tenets of orthodox Christianity:
The Trinity
God as a despot 
Humankind's total depravity 
That mortal life was merely a probational preparation for the afterlife
That Jesus was a sacrificial substitute for the payment for our sins 

Chaney's theology reflected these observations.

Nature of God
Chaney's concept of God was not a judgmental external deity but a spiritual presence found within the consciousness of individuals. The awareness of “God within,” Chaney argued, was through virtuous “moral constants” that resided within the consciousness of individuals

Unfortunately, Chaney's erudite argument for a “God within” is challenging to follow and, at times, complicated by his listing of alternate “moral constants” from “law, right, spirit, and personal identity” or “the principles of mathematics, morals, spirit, and personality.”

What is clear is that Chaney believed in a loving God who resided within us.

Christology
Chaney was well aware that Unitarian beliefs in Jesus were widely criticized in the South. Orthodox Southern Christianity was firmly based on the belief that Jesus was a member of the Godhead. Chaney's preaching that Jesus was a man was considered outright blasphemy. Chaney responded to his detractors, saying that Jesus was not “merely a man” but a “pure man.”

This “pure man,” called Jesus, revealed to humankind the nature of a spiritual life.

Other points on Chaney's views of Christ include
The son of God in spirit, the son of Abraham and David and Joseph and Mary in body, such I believe, was Jesus. 
God doing mighty works in and through a man; that is the Apostolic presentation of Jesus. I accept it. I believe it. 
And when Jesus comes to his own, ""a man approved of God""—son of David as to his body, son of God in spirit.

Atonement
Chaney emphatically rejected the widely held Christian tenet that Jesus's death by crucifixion was an act of substitutionary or vicarious atonement. He observed that the very notion that “Jesus suffered and died for sinners . . . in their place, has emptied the doctrine of truth and efficacy.”

Jesus's death was not to render payment required by “some unseen power, either God or Devil.” Instead, Jesus's death illustrated God's love for his creations.

In Chaney's theology, love created a unique burden upon those who loved when the shortcomings of a beloved are seen. “It is the penalty of all true love to suffer in all that is faulty in its beloved.”

That is, God so loved humankind that our shortcomings (i.e., sin) imposed a penalty upon God. Thus, God suffered “the consequences of caring so much for the sinner that [God] could not leave him (humankind) in his sin without protest, entreaty, and prostration even unto the death of the cross.” 

Chaney reasoned that 

The Trinity
Chaney did not believe in the central Christian doctrine of the Trinity, which defined one God that existed as three equal and eternal coequals of God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and God the Holy Spirit.

For Chaney, the Trinity was a “bewildering statement of creed.” The Trinity, Chaney taught, was not part of original Christianity. “We believe in the Bible statements about God and Christ and the Holy Spirit, and not in creed statements” formulated centuries after Jesus's death.

Chaney added that Unitarians “believe in ‘one God the Father’ and in ‘Jesus Christ, his Son’ and in ‘the Holy Spirit’ as a divine influence proceeding from the Father.” 

Succinctly, Chaney believed that “unity, not trinity, is the symbol of the real deity.”

Nature of Man
Chaney's faith in humankind's capacity for good stood in contrast to the orthodox Calvinist doctrine that rendered humankind as innately depraved due to Adam's fall; predestined by a sovereign God to either eternal damnation or heavenly bliss.

Chaney deconstructed the story of “the fall of Adam” on various levels.
Did the Hebrew scripture provide a veritable account of what happened to the first man? Chaney observed, “It seems to me improbable.” 
Did Adam's fall account for the presence of evil in the world? Chaney noted, “I do not believe it is true as a fact of history.” 
Chaney, who did not eschew mingling scripture with science, observed that given the “immense antiquity of the earth, and the presence of death long before Adam lived or sinned,” concluded Adam's origin story was neither “history nor science.” Adding that there were “many Adams;” and that humanity “is not all descended from a single pair.”

Chaney saw in man a battle between “brute” and “angel.” A battle in which the “angel” could win. Seen through his ministerial lens, humankind's moral character, the angel character, emerged when man obtained a “consciousness of sin.”

In his sermon on “Man,” Chaney summarized his view of man (i.e., humankind)

Original Sin
Consistent with his optimistic view of humankind, Chaney rejected the orthodox Christian dogma of original sin. Chaney observed that the concept of Adam's fall and its consequential generational sin rested upon the unquestioned acceptance of a few lines of scriptural texts.

Chaney's biblical criticism was more demanding and eschewed the literal reading of Genesis scripture.

Personal Sin
Central to Chaney's teaching on sin was that the consequence of sin was not borne by one's eternal soul but upon the living who suffered a sinner's transgression. That is, Chaney repositioned sin's consequence from one felt in an afterlife experience to one that had an immediate impact on the here-and-now

Hell
In the closing decade of the 1890s, disturbing images of eternal damnation of hell would have resonated with Southerners. Rev. F.W. McClesky, a Georgia Methodist minister, for example, preached that “hell fires have all power to burn terribly, inflecting fearful bodily torture.” 

Chaney rejected such depictions of hell. “It is monstrous, untrue, maddening; no lover of God will believe it of him.”   For Chaney, retribution for sins is incompatible with the infinite love and fatherhood of God.

Chaney observed

Biblical Authority
Chaney's Southern missionary efforts repeatedly faced criticism that Unitarians did not “believe in the Bible as the word of God.” Chaney offered that a literal reading of the Bible would make God responsible for all the “imperfections in chronology” and “obvious inequalities of moral and spiritual insights.”

Chaney declared that the Bible was a body of rich religious literature of “unequal value,” providing a record of the evolution of religious beliefs. Although providing religious insight, the Bible should not be considered a “final authority” on religious interpretation. Instead, Chaney stressed that Unitarianism gave individuals permission to use their “own reason and conscience in the discovery of truth and the practice of righteousness.”

Chaney cautioned that the truth in the Bible is offered like a precious ore. It must be worked to reveal its value.

Death
Rev. George Leonard Chaney died in Salem, in the house in which he was raised, at age 86 on April 19, 1922. His wife, Caroline Isabel Carter Chaney, outlived her husband by three years, dying on December 26, 1925, at her family farm in Leominster, Massachusetts.

They are buried in the Harmony Grove Cemetery in Salem, Massachusetts.

Myths
Although Chaney's ministerial and administrative careers were well documented in contemporary periodicals, three myths have persisted.

Associated Charities
Myth One: Chaney founded the Associated Charities in Boston.	

In 1867, Chaney instituted an assistance program overseen by the church's Board of Charities. Per the program, if church members encountered an individual seeking alms, they were to direct that person to the church where they would be registered and receive needed support. Chaney remarked that “he did not know of any better system than this for the distribution of aid.”

This program was remarkably similar to a broader and more formal approach instituted twelve years later in 1879 called the Associated Charities. The Associated Charities was an umbrella structure that coordinated the charitable work of Boston's church and non-church organizations.  Under the Associated Charities program, indigent persons were required to register on the Associated Charities rolls. Once registered, they would receive support and access to training to develop self-supporting skills.

The similarities between the two programs may account for an inaccuracy in some historical reports in which Chaney helped establish the Associated Charities.  Instead, Unitarian minister Rev. Edward Everett Hale, pastor of the South Congregational Church, was instrumental in forming the Associated Charities.  Chaney is not mentioned in contemporary reports at the formation of this uber-charitable organization.

Library Open to Whites and Blacks
Myth Two:  Chaney established a free lending library for women and African Americans at the Church of Our Father. 

The source of this myth has not been identified, but it has persisted in scholarly papers and other online references. For example, a well-researched 1982 paper, Unitarian Universalism: The First Hundred Years in Atlanta, stated that Chaney “started the first free lending library which was also the first library open to women and blacks.”

The Church of Our Father did have a small library during Chaney's pastorate (1882-1890). Known as the Parish Library, it was open only to members. It was also a vehicle to lend out Unitarian literature to prospective converts.

A free public library was established during the pastorate of Chaney's successor, Rev. Roswell Cole (1891-1895). At that time, there was a larger effort to “rebuild” the church membership and finances. To that end, male church members had been organized into a “working committee” known as the Liberal Church League.

It was under the guise of the Liberal Church League that the free, public lending library was launched to raise the profile of the church and attract new members. The church ran a month-long advertising campaign in the Atlanta papers to that end.  Though the newspaper campaign did not mention any restriction on who could use the library, given the norm of Atlanta's highly segregated society, a “membership program” that desegregated church membership would have sparked highly visible public and intense church debates.

There was no mention in the church's meeting minutes or articles in local Atlanta press alluding to the opening of a segregated library

Georgia Institute of Technology
Myth Three: Chaney's Artisans’ Institute was the forerunner in the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) organization.

This myth is found in Chaney's obituary notices published in various newspapers and then, based on those references, repeated in scholarly papers and other online references. The source of this myth has been traced to Chaney himself.

In his November 1890 farewell address to the Church of Our Father, while recounting accomplishments, Chaney affirmed “the Artisans’ Institute which led the way for the School of Technology.”  The following day, when the paper printed a letter from Chaney in which he pointed out errors in the earlier reporting of his farewell address, Chaney did not amend his remarks about the Artisans’ Institute.

In an 1894 article penned by Chaney in the Southern Unitarian entitled “A Decade of Church Building in Atlanta, GA,” Chaney again attributed the Artisans’ Institute as the seed “out of which grew the interest which culminated in Georgia's grand School of Technology.”

Years later, in 1916, Chaney's recollection of his time in the South was read into the record at a Southern Conference in Richmond. In those remarks, Chaney again noted, ""The Artisans’ Institute, which began in our church, laid the foundation for the Georgia Institute of Technology, now the pride and reliance of the State.”

Unfortunately, contemporary reporting and verifiable information do not support Chaney's assertions.

The Artisans’ Institution, founded in 1885, was a short-lived school and unlikely to have made an impression on the general public. The Georgia Machinery Company that housed the school declared bankruptcy, and its assets were sold at a public auction on May 4, 1886.    After that date, no further advertising for the Artisans’ Institute is found in the local papers.

Chaney did not participate in any of Georgia Tech's key organizational activities. In October 1885, the Georgia legislature established the school, then known as Georgia School of Technology.  The legislation did not, however, establish the location of the new technology school, sparking petitions from Macon, Columbus, Athens, Milledgeville, Atlanta, and other cities to be selected.

Chaney was mostly absent from Atlanta during this period of active lobbying. When in town, his sermon topics gave no hint that Chaney was engaged in the debate. As debate on the school's location intensified, Rev. Chaney departed Atlanta for his summer vacation and to attend a Unitarian conference in Saratoga, New York.

The supporters of this new Georgia technology school would not have sought out Chaney for his New England-based funding-raising prowess. Unlike the education of “colored people” promoted by Rev. Chaney, the new technology school would serve a white Southern population and find a ready base of Southern support. Rev. Chaney, in his 1891 “The New South Atlanta” article in The New England Magazine, confirmed that funding for the Atlanta technology school was secured by “munificent contributions of its (Atlanta) citizens.”

Finally, in a review of the news accounts on the opening of the technology school on October 6, 1888, there is no mention of the Artisans’ Institute or Rev. Chaney. The same is true two years later, in June 1890, at the first commencement, which was extensively reported in local papers.

It remains an unexplained chapter in Chaney's otherwise well-known and honorable career why he inflated the role his Artisans’ Institution played in the organization of the Georgia Institute of Technology.",2025-02-04,['American Unitarians' '1836 births' '1922 deaths'],"['Hollis Street Church' ""American Unitarian Association's"" 'Atlanta'

776,36416,76023812,14207,Artificial intelligence in architecture,"Artificial intelligence in architecture describes the use of artificial intelligence in automation, design and planning in the architectural process or in assisting human skills in the field of architecture. Artificial Intelligence is thought to potentially lead to and ensue major changes in architecture.  

AI's potential in optimization of design, planning and productivity have been noted as accelerators in the field of architectural work. The ability of AI to potentially amplify an architect's design process has also been noted. Fears of the replacement of aspects or core processes of the architectural profession by Artificial Intelligence have also been raised, as well as the philosophical implications on the profession and creativity.

 Implications 

 Benefits 
Artificial intelligence, according to ArchDaily, is said to potentially significantly augment the Architectural profession though its ability to improve the design and planning process as well as increasing productivity. Through its ability to handle a large amount of data, AI are said to potentially allow architects a range of design choices with criteria considerations such as budget, requirements adjusted to space, and sustainability goals calculated as part of the design process. ArchDaily said this may allow the design of optimized alternatives that can then undergo human review. AI tools are also said to potentially allow architects to assimilate urban and environmental data to inform their designs, streamlining initial stages of project planning and increasing efficiency and productivity.

The advances in generative design through the input of specific prompts allow architects to produce visual designs, including photorealistic images, and thus render and explore various material choices and spatial configurations. ArchDaily noted this could speed the creative process as well as allow for experimentation and sophistication in the design. Additionally, AI's capacity for pattern recognition and coding could aid architects in organizing design resources and developing custom applications, thus enhancing the efficiency and the collaboration between both architects and AI.

AI is thought to also be able to contribute to the sustainability of buildings by analyzing various factors and following recommended energy-efficient modifications, thus pushing the industry towards greener practices. The use of AI in building maintenance, project management, and the creation of immersive virtual reality experiences are also thought as potentially augmenting the architectural design process and workflow.

Examples include the use of text-to-image systems such as Midjourney to create detailed architectural images, and the use of AI optimization systems from companies such as Finch3D and Autodesk to automatically generate floor plans from simple programmatic inputs.

Architect Kudless in an interview to Dezeen recounted that he uses AI to innovate in architectural design by incorporating materials and scenes not usually present in initial plans, which he believes can significantly alter client presentations. He told Dezeen he believes one should show clients renderings from the onset, with AI assisting in this work, arguing that changes in design should be a positive aspect of the client-designer relationship by actively involving clients in the process. Additionally, Kudless highlighted the AI's potential to facilitate labor in architectural firms, particularly in automating rendering tasks, thus reducing the workload on junior staff while maintaining control over the creative output.

 Emergent aesthetics 
In an interview for the AItopia series to Dezeen, designer Tim Fu discussed the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in architecture, there he proposed a future where AI could herald a ""neoclassical futurist"" style, blending the grandeur of classical aesthetics with futuristic design. Through his collaborative project, The AI Stone Carver, Fu showcased how AI can innovate traditional practices by generating design concepts that are then realized through human craftsmanship, such as stone carving by mason Till Apfel. This approach he believed celebrated the fusion of diverse architectural styles and also emphasized the unique capabilities of AI in enhancing creative design processes.

Fu told Dezeen he envisions the integration of AI in design as a means to revive the ornamentation and detailed aesthetics characteristic of classical architecture, moving away from the minimalism, which he said dominates contemporary architecture.  He argued that AI's involvement in the ideation phase of design allows for a reversal in the roles of machine and human, enabling architects and designers to focus on creating more intricate and ornamental structures. Fu's optimistic outlook extended to the broader impact of AI on the architectural field, seeing it as an indispensable tool that will shift rather than replace human roles, enriching the field with innovative designs that pay homage to the beauty and qualities of classical architecture not present in contemporary architecture while embracing new technologies.

This perspective resonates with designers like Manas Bhatia, whose explorations similarly embrace generative AI as a co-creator and a medium to express ideas, blend architectural traditions, and speculate spatial futures. Bhatia’s work, informed by a lifelong fascination with natural geometries and organic structures, reimagines architecture at the intersection of ecology and computation. Projects such as Fluid Mughal Marvels, Symbiotic Architecture, and Future Cities explore how AI can help transcend conventional boundaries of aesthetics, function, and context—shaping speculative built environments that fuse cultural memory with biomorphic imagination.

 Concerns 

As artificial intelligence continues to expand its presence across various industries, its impact on the architectural profession has become a topic of growing discussion. These discussions focus on how AI processes may influence traditional architectural practices, potentially altering job roles, and shaping the nature of creativity. While AI-driven processes may increase efficiency in some aspects of the profession, it also raises questions about the potential loss of unique design perspectives. These thoughts have been countered by many prominent creative figures in the realm of AI Architecture such as Stephen Coorlas, Tim Fu, Hassan Ragab, and Manas Bhatia who have showcased the amplification of creativity in design and potential benefits in terms of restoring creative power to the designer.

One concern is that AI-powered tools may reduce the demand for human input in certain tasks. There is speculation that this may result in a shift toward managerial or supervisory roles for architects.

In some design scenarios, algorithmically generated solutions can be adjusted to prioritize efficiency and cost-effectiveness, which some argue may overshadow the creative and contextual nuances that define individual architectural styles. As with any discipline though, it has been determined that AI can be configured to provide beneficial results based on inputs and end goals the architect or designer assigns it.  

There are also concerns about the potential for AI to exacerbate inequalities within the architectural profession. For instance, larger firms with greater resources to invest in advanced AI technologies may gain a competitive edge over smaller firms and independent architects. This dynamic could contribute to industry consolidation, potentially limiting the diversity of architectural practice and stifling innovation. Ethical considerations in regard to cultural sensitivity have also been raised due to the datasets used to train AI. Without proper vetting of data or implementing failsafe overrides, AI generated outcomes can trend toward overly documented and prioritized content.",2025-04-16,"['Applications of artificial intelligence' 'Architecture'

780,35727,5346938,9654,Lokrum,"Lokrum (, ) is an island in the Adriatic Sea  from the city of Dubrovnik, Croatia. It stretches from northwest to southeast and receives regular ferry service from the Old City port.

Austrian archduke (and short-lived Emperor of Mexico) Maximilian once had a holiday home on the island. A monastery and a botanical garden survive from his era. On the island's highest point at  above sea level stands Fort Royal Castle, which was built by the French during Napoleon's occupation of Croatia, though it was later named ""Maximilian's Tower"" by the Austrians.

History

The first written mention of Lokrum was in 1023 when the Benedictine abbey and monastery were founded. The name Lokrum comes from the Latin, , meaning sour fruit. This derives from the tradition of cultivating exotic plants on the island, a tradition started in the time of the Benedictines. The last Benedictines left the island in 1808.

The Island is commonly believed by the populace of Croatia to be cursed. Legend states that the island's Benedictine monks were forced to leave by an individual of power, commonly the pope or the ruling nobility, with the monks given a set of time to leave the island. On the night of the deadline to leave, it is said the monks travelled the island dripping a trail of candle wax, and placed a curse on the island and anyone who tried to seek it for their own in the future. According to legend, Richard the Lionheart was shipwrecked in 1192 after returning home from the crusades and was cast safely ashore on Lokrum. He pledged to build a church on the island but, at the plea of Dubrovnik citizens, the church was built on the nearby mainland instead.

Archduke Maximilian Ferdinand of Habsburg had a mansion built on the island in 1859 with a magnificent garden laid out, criss-crossed with pathways, full of amazing plants and botanical wonders. The island was originally purchased by Maximilian's wife Charlotte of Mexico, with part of her marriage dowry, and she retained ownership of the island even after she and her husband became Emperor and Empress of Mexico. After the Emperor Maximilian's execution the island was surrendered to the Habsburg Family in a deal struck between Franz Joseph I of Austria and Leopold II of Belgium. Charlotte had become insane and Leopold had renounced in the name of his sister all claims to her and her husband's property in Austria.

Leopold was more concerned with acquiring his sister's great fortune than with her rights to property in Austria. The island was given to Archduchess Elisabeth Marie of Austria as part of her marriage dowry; Yugoslavia claimed it under the Treaty of Saint-Germain. Princess Elizabeth stated that she was no longer a Habsburg, having renounced her rights on the occasion of her marriage; therefore Yugoslavia had no right to sequester the property. The case was settled by a payment of $575,000 to the Princess. In 1959 a Botanical Garden was founded on Lokrum which contains native and imported, tropical and subtropical plants, and other vegetation originating in Australia and South America. The island is also inhabited by families of peacocks brought over by Maximilian from the Canary Islands.

Over the course of the Croatian War of Independence, the island sustained 50 direct hits by Serbian Artillery bombardment, with much of the botanical gardens sustaining damage and the historical Library and the records kept with it burning down.

Locations
The following are notable locations on Lokrum.

Benedictine Monastery
The Benedictine Monastery is perhaps the most predominant of all Points of Interest on Lokrum. The Monastery is first historically referenced in 1023 and existed until some point in the 15th century at which point the Benedictine Monks were forced to leave the island. Popular legend states that, upon their eviction from the Island, the monks of Lokrum passed a curse on any who possessed the island. A portion of the Monastery has been converted into a restaurant and another segment has been converted into a museum. The replica of The Iron Throne can be found at the Benedictine Monastery.

Botanical Garden
On the eastern side of the island, protected from the open sea, there is a small natural harbour. The island covers an area of  and is covered in thick Mediterranean flora and woods: laurel, oak, pines, cypress and black pines. There are also olives, agaves, cacti, magnolia and palms. On the southern part of the island there is a small salt lake, 10 m deep, known as ""the Dead Sea"" (Mrtvo More). Nearby there is a deserted Benedictine monastery, founded in 1023. The triple-naved basilica, and a 14th-century part of the monastery were badly damaged in the 1667 Dubrovnik earthquake.Naklada Naprijed, The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide, pg. 364, Zagreb (1999),  The monastery was deserted in 1798. Today Lokrum is a Nature Reserve and a Special Forest Vegetation Reserve. At some point after 2014, the European Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus L.) was illegally introduced to Lokrum. Since then, it has become highly invasive, causing large scale damage to the Botanical Gardens and destroying some of the 200 species of plant found in the Botanical Gardens.Jasprica, N., & Dolina, K. (2016, January). The invasion of the european rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus L., 1758) on the Lokrum island–an example of poor management of the protected area. In the Second Croatian Symposium on Invasive Species with International Participation. As of 2022, the rabbits no longer live on the island, only beautiful and non-invasive peacocks do. 

Charlotte's Well

Charlotte's Well is an oval retaining pond dating from Maximilian of Habsburg's ownership of the island.

The Dead Sea
The Dead Sea is a small salt lake located on the southern side of the Island of Lokrum. The lake is fed from a series of caves and fractures in the island. These caves and fractures can be observed and, in some cases, traversed from the surrounding sea. The lake itself is believed to have been formed by the collapse of a large cavern.Crnčević, M., Bratoš, A., & Tutman, P. (2017, January). Preliminary data on fish fauna in small marine lake on Lokrum island–special reserve and Natura 2000 site, Croatia. In 1st SouthEast European Ichthyological Conference.

The lake is considered a tourist attraction and is regularly visited by tourists and scuba divers.

Fort Royal

Fort Royal is a military emplacement located on the highest peak of Lokrum overlooking Dubrovnik. Construction of this fortress began under the French Empire in 1806 and was completed in 1835 by Austria.

791,34399,75968252,4035,Kryburg gauntlet,"The Kryburg gauntlet is a medieval iron glove discovered near Switzerland's Kyburg Castle during a 2021-2022 archeological excavation.

 Discovery 
Demolition work was planned near Kyburg Castle, about 20 miles north of Zurich; the castle was near a medieval town and the planned work threatened any artifacts that might be present on the site. Excavation to preserve any artifacts present was carried out in late 2021 and early 2022. One of the major finds was the gauntlet.

A medieval-era weaving cellar and multiple other artifacts, including over 50 iron pieces, were also found during the excavation. The gauntlet was found within the remains of the weaving cellar, leading archeologists to believe a blacksmith was working in the area before a fire destroyed the weaving cellar.

 Description 
The right hand gauntlet was almost complete. Portions of a left hand gauntlet were also recovered. The gauntlet has four finger-folds. Side rivets allowed the gauntlet to be a flexible glove. It is made of iron and was likely attached to an interior textile or leather glove.

Because the gauntlet shows evidence of creation by a skilled craftsman, and such armor was expensive, the gauntlet probably belonged to a member of the nobility or another person of high status.

 Importance 
According to Zurich Cantonal Archaeology, most other gauntlets recovered have been from later periods; only five others from this period are known to exist from Swiss excavations, and all are fragmental. 

 Exhibition 
Kyburg Castle planned a permanent display of a copy of the gauntlet and a reconstruction of what it would have looked like when it was made starting in late March of 2024 and a three-week display of the original starting in September of 2024.",2024-04-19,['Medieval armour' 'Archaeology'],"['medieval' 'Kyburg Castle' 'gauntlet' 'blacksmith'

795,25468,75701649,84875,Mount Okmok,"Mount Okmok is a volcano on eastern Umnak Island, in the central-eastern Aleutian Islands of Alaska. Part of the Aleutian Volcanic Arc, it was formed by the subduction of the oceanic Pacific Plate under the North American Plate. Okmok is a large shield volcano capped by a  wide caldera. The caldera contains numerous cinder cones, their lava flows, and a few lakes. Okmok erupts mainly basaltic lava, mostly from the cones within the caldera.

Activity began in the Pleistocene. Two large caldera-forming eruptions took place during the Holocene, with a volcanic explosivity index (VEI) of 6; the second of these occurred in 43 BCE and caused a volcanic winter that might have changed the history of Egypt. After this second caldera-forming eruption a crater lake formed in the caldera, and drained in one of the largest known floods of the Holocene. Okmok is one of the most active volcanoes of North America; numerous eruptions have produced lava flows within the caldera, and the 1817 eruption destroyed an Aleut village.

The last eruption was in 2008 and produced several new vents in the caldera. This eruption, which occurred with little forewarning, yielded a volcanic cloud that produced volcanic ash fall around Okmok. The volcano is monitored by the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO).

 Geography and geomorphology 
Okmok is on northeastern Umnak Island, a remote location in the central Aleutian Islands,  from Anchorage. The former Fort Glenn Army Air Base is on the eastern side of the volcano. Some unmaintained trails and dirt roads lead around the mountain. One dirt road leads to the gap in the caldera rim and is the principal way to access the caldera. Umnak Island is largely uninhabited, but fishery vessels sail around it all year round and a major North Pacific aviation route passes in the area. Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island, the most important production place of seafood in the United States, is  from Okmok. The name ""Okmok"" was applied to the mountain by Dunn 1908, who had discovered the caldera two years before. The Aleut name of the caldera is ; the second word means ""to be thick"". An alternative name for the volcano is ""Zoomie"".

Okmok is a  wide shield volcano (sometimes described as ""shield-like composite volcano"") with gentle (6°) slopes. With a volume of  and an area of about -, it is one of the largest volcanoes in the Aleutians. Its slopes are mostly covered by pyroclastic flow deposits from the second caldera-forming eruption. There are more than twenty Pleistocene-Holocene cones on the outer flank of Okmok, including the  high Tulik (highest point of Okmok) on the southern and Jag Peak on the southwestern flank.

Glacial valleys, gullies, and amphitheatre-shaped valleys with widths reaching  cut into the slopes. Numerous creeks radially drain the edifice to the Bering Sea and Pacific Ocean: From north clockwise they include Crater Creek, Antler Creek, Kansas Creek, Missouri Creek, Ginger Creek, Colorado Creek and Delaware Creek. Crater Creek has formed a fan around Cape Tanak, as mudflows from Okmok are preferentially channeled through this creek.

 Caldera 
The summit is cut by a  wide caldera, breached to the northeast by Crater Creek through a notch known as ""Gates"". Its rim is about  high above the floor. Arc-shaped structures  out from the northern and eastern margins indicate the caldera is actually two nested calderas. Lava flows, pyroclastic flows and scoria deposits crop out in the steep cliffs that form the inner wall of the caldera. The highest point on the caldera rim is the  high ""Mount Okmok"" on the northern rim. The Global Volcanism Program reports a height of .

Lava flows and several volcanic cones dot the otherwise relatively flat caldera floor. The cones are named A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H and  (formed in 2008, meaning ""surprising"" in the Atkan language) and form a ring on the caldera floor. Some of the cones are heavily eroded to the point of being unrecognizable. The major cones are the  high Cone A (two craters) at the southwestern margin, Cone E (a crater with a lake) in the western half of the caldera, Cone D (the largest) in the eastern half of the caldera, Cone F (crater breached to the northwest) at the southern-southeastern margin of the caldera and the  high, already erosionally modified Ahmanilix just west of Cone D.

Meltwater from snowmelt and surface water flow towards the centre of the caldera, generating waterbodies that drain through Crater Creek.  there are two major lakes, one north of Cone D and a slightly smaller one at the centr of the caldera; both are partially or entirely within craters excavated by the 2008 eruption. Numerous other lakes are dispersed between the summit craters of cones and plains between the cones. A small debris-covered glacier covers the inward southern/north-facing slopes of the caldera, and rock glaciers have been identified inside the caldera. Past glaciation left small moraines within the caldera.

 Geology 
The Pacific Plate subducts beneath the North American Plate at a rate of , giving rise to the  long Aleutian Volcanic Arc. The arc has about forty volcanoes between Alaska and Kamchatka. In the central Aleutians these include from west to east Seguam, Amukta, Chagulak, Yunaska, Herbert, Carlisle, Cleveland, Uliaga, Kagamil, Vsevidof, Recheshnoi, Okmok, Bogoslof, Makushin, Mount Gilbert, Westdahl, Fisher, Shishaldin, Isanotski and Roundtop. Apart from volcanoes, subduction in the Aleutians produces frequent earthquakes.

Umnak island is on Cretaceous seafloor; the submerged Umnak oceanic plateau might extend under the island. Southwest of Okmok, a ridge formed by Tertiary volcanic rocks joins the volcano to the rest of Umnak island and the volcanoes Recheshnoi and Vsevidof. Northeast of Okmok is the Idak plateau, an uplifted older volcano. There is no evidence of faulting at Okmok. There are two tectonic stress regimes at Okmok, a northwest-southeast regional regime and a radial local one. Coastal uplift has occurred during historical times.

Surface deformation has been recorded before and after eruptions, often continuing for years, implying underground magma movements centered at  depth. The deformation source constitutes the magma chamber. Episodically recharged from deeper reservoirs, the magma chamber has a temperature exceeding  and is thought to be insulated by accumulated crystals. Most eruptions arise from the magma chamber, sometimes through sills or shallower chambers that feed the intracaldera cones like Cone A. With exceptions, magma is only briefly stored underground before erupting to the surface. Shallower pools of basaltic andesite magma are rarely involved, but played a role during the 2008 eruption. With rare exceptions (the Cone D immediately after the Okmok II eruption and the 2008 eruption), the magma is deflected sideward before reaching the surface via ring faults, thus erupting at the margin of the caldera instead of at its center.

 Composition 
Okmok has erupted basalt and basaltic andesite, which define a tholeiitic rock suite with systematic variations of silicon dioxide and trace element contents over time. The caldera-forming eruptions initially produced some rhyodacite and rhyolite, but most of their products are basaltic andesite. 20th century activity produced mostly basaltic rocks until 2008, when basaltic andesite reappeared. Vents in the northwestern sector of the caldera produce more mafic magmas than those in the southeastern. Okmok is the principal source of prehistoric obsidians in the Aleutians, as far as the Alaska Peninsula more than  from the volcano; the so-called ""Group I"" obsidian in Alaskan archaeological sites may come from there. 

The Okmok rocks contain only small quantities of phenocrysts, which include clinopyroxene, olivine and plagioclase; rhyolites also contain augite pyroxene, hypersthene and titanomagnetite. Water and ice interaction has converted some of the basalts to palagonite. The rocks have a typical composition for volcanic arc magmas, with enrichment of elements presumably derived from subducted sediments and sediment-derived fluids. The subducting plate releases fluids into the overlying mantle, which ascends under Okmok and melts at temperatures of  to form basaltic magmas. The melts are relatively water-poor and reduced, which along with other factors results in tholeiitic magmas. Older models have a tectonic boundary close to Okmok facilitate the ascent of tholeiitic melts. The andesite and rhyolite probably form through fractional crystallization of the basalts.

 Climate, vegetation and fauna 

The Aleutian Islands have cloudy and rainy weather, with frequent storms in winter and fog in summer. Mean annual temperatures are . There is frequent snow cover, except on recent lava flows. The mountain obstructs the airflow, thus on the eastern (lee) side cloud cover is less. The closest weather station is at Dutch Harbor, and may not reflect the climate at Okmok. During the ice ages >55,000 and 24,000–12,000 years ago, the mountain was covered by glaciers. Minor glacier advances may have taken place between 7,500–5,500 and 3,500–2,000 years ago.

Tussock grass and tundra covers the lower parts of the volcano, with numerous flowers budding during late summer. The upper parts of the edifice above  are bare. Animals include red foxes, reindeer and numerous birds, and marine life occurs in the seas surrounding Umnak.

 Eruption history 
Volcanic activity on northeastern Umnak Island commenced about 2.1–1.7 million years ago, eventually giving rise to Okmok volcano. A single rhyolitic flow was emitted on the northern flank during the Pleistocene. Older volcanic features, such as the Pleistocene Tulik, either formed in ice or show traces of glacial erosion. Effusive eruptions characterize the activity of the volcano, except for the two large caldera-forming eruptions during the Holocene: ""Okmok I"" about 12,000 years ago and ""Okmok II"" in 43 BCE. The occurrence of these explosive eruptions may be due to the accumulation of volatile-rich basaltic andesite magmas under the volcano. 

The pre-Holocene volcanic history of Okmok is poorly known. Tephra from Okmok has been recovered in marine sediment cores from the Bering Sea. A large eruption 64,500 years ago (VEI 6, comparable to the caldera-forming eruptions) produced about   of dense rock equivalent, which forms the ""SR4"" tephra in the Bering Sea. The volcano was probably glaciated during that time.

Twelve separate vents erupted inside the caldera since the last caldera-forming eruption, forming tuff cones, maars and cinder cones. Some eruptions began underwater and produced hyaloclastite and pillow lavas. The intracaldera cones are not precisely dated but Cone D is the oldest vent, at 2,000–1,000 years. Subsequent activity formed tuff cones until about 1,000 years before present, Cone F probably between 400 and 1,000 years before present and Cone E 400 years ago. Outside of the caldera, a thick base surge deposit was emplaced on the western side of Okmok 1,500 years ago and mudflows 400–300 years ago. Deposits close to Kettle Cape imply that eruptions capable of depositing ash there took place on average every 150 years during the Holocene. After the 43 BCE eruption, the rate was about one eruption every 75 years. The magma supply rate since that eruption amounts to . More than 60 tephra layers were emplaced after the Okmok I eruption. Seismic swarms and increased seismicity occurred in 2001 and 2009.

 Okmok I eruption 
The Okmok I eruption 12,000 years ago is poorly documented, but some general features can be established. A lateral blast or a debris flow may have initiated the eruption. Pyroclastic flows descended the slopes of the volcano and crossed the sea to Unalaska Island. The mountain was probably snow- and ice-covered at the time, and pyroclastic flows melted the ice to form mudflows. Caldera collapse occurred only late in the sequence, and a debris avalanche formed on the northwestern flank. The eruption reached a VEI of 6. Its volume was probably twice as large as that of the Okmok II eruption, albeit with significant uncertainty. Before the caldera collapse, Okmok might have reached a height of .

This eruption was part of a wider surge of volcanic activity recorded in Greenland at the end of the last ice age. Conceivably, the retreat of the glacial icecaps would have generated stresses on Earth's crust that drove increased volcanic activity. The eruption would have devastated eastern Umnak, potentially wiping out most land-based life there. Ash attributed to the Okmok I eruption has been found in the Anangula Archeological District off the western coast of Umnak. The eruption may have led to the abandonment of the site, with inhabitants migrating west after the eruption, but more recent research indicates that climatic changes played a larger role, and there may not have been any substantial cultural change.

 Holocene between Okmok I and II 
Between the caldera-forming eruptions, the so-called ""Clear Creek Basalt"" lava flows, and various scoria deposits were emplaced on the volcano. A hydrothermal system may have been active in the caldera. At some point, Tulik collapsed and formed a debris avalanche that reached the sea. Several flank eruptions took place, the largest of which produced a  high cone at Cape Aslik.

More than three large explosive eruptions occurred during the Holocene, between the caldera-forming eruptions, one of which emplaced the so-called ""Middle Scoria"" shortly before the 43 BCE eruption. This layer consists of a thin volcanic ash layer overlaid by multiple lithic- and scoria-rich layers and base surge layers. The eruption column was about  high; frequently, water entered the column, giving rise to layered (layers during water interaction and separate layers when there was no water interaction) deposits. The Middle Scoria eruption resembled the historical 2008 eruption.

 43 BCE: Okmok II eruption 
After a period of quiescence, an intense eruption took place at Okmok in 43 BCE. A rhyodacitic eruption column rose over the volcano from a vent in its northern part. Pumice lapilli fell out from the eruption column. The fallout was emplaced in three distinct units, with a brief break between the first two that lasted days to months. The fallout deposits are up to a meter thick, with the first unit being emplaced north and the second and third units southeast of Okmok. Then, a change in magma composition from dacite to andesite heralded a dramatic increase of activity. A  hot pyroclastic flow descended the slopes of Okmok, burning the vegetation buried by the preceding fallout, and traversed ridges and topography. The flow consisted of one dense basal portion and a less dense overriding cloud. The flow deposits are tens of meters thick and contain black scoria, lithics, crystals, and glass. Some flows crossed the  wide sea between Umnak and Unalaska to form deposits on the latter, probably on top of pumice rafts. The flows on Umnak form two facies, one stratified and one massive, depending on local topographic conditions. It is probably at this point that the collapse of the second caldera commenced. The eruption probably took place early in the year, but with the mountain largely snow-free, which may imply a long duration.

The total volume of material erupted by the Okmok II event was about , covering about  of Umnak. It is classified as a VEI 6 eruption, and tephra was carried as far as Greenland, where it has been recovered from ice cores. It has been used as a tephrochronologic marker on the Aleutians. Humans abandoned a village on Carlisle Island west of Okmok as a consequence of the eruption, allowing seabirds to reoccupy certain areas. Impact on the other Islands of Four Mountains was probably less marked, but people may have left them after the eruption for some time.

The Okmok II eruption released about 15–16 teragrams of sulfur (but no chlorine or fluorine) into the stratosphere, causing a volcanic winter with  cooling across the Northern Hemisphere. The exact cooling depends on the location where temperatures are measured and the size of the sulfur release. For the Mediterranean, cooling reached about . The effects of the eruption were compounded by another volcanic explosion one or two years before: 43 BCE and the following two years were among the coldest during the last 2,500 years, with the following decade the fourth-coldest, producing a ""little ice age"". This cold is recorded both in Chinese historical records and in climate proxies such as tree rings and cave deposits, and has been reproduced by computer models. Famines in China and epidemics in Italy have been correlated to the event. In the Mediterranean, computer modeling and historical reports show that the eruption led to cold weather, snowfall, famines and a failure of the floods on the Nile, causing an economic and social crisis in Egypt. While a direct causal link to the Okmok eruption is not proven, and food production recovered in the following years, the longer-term effects on Egypt's food resources of both the famine and the increased interest of the Roman Republic (which was itself affected by a serious crisis), contributed to the final collapse of the Ptolemaic dynasty and the Roman Republic after the 31 BCE Battle of Actium, leading to the Roman Empire.

 Intracaldera lake 
After the Okmok II eruption, a crater lake filled the caldera within a decade, eventually reaching an elevation of  above sea level. At this level, it had a volume of  and a depth of . Waves on the lake eroded the volcanic cones and deposited silt and sandstone, and lavas formed pillow lavas. Cone D was emplaced during two eruptive episodes within this lake. About 1,400–1,000 years ago, an intense eruption of Cone D produced large waves that overtopped the northeastern caldera margin. The lake broke out in one or several catastrophic floods, with discharge reaching -; this may be one of the largest floods of the Holocene, being only exceeded by the Altai and Missoula Floods and a flood on Nevado de Colima in Mexico. Another lake formed later, water levels reached an altitude of . Pre-caldera rock units crop out in the valley formed by the breach.

 Historical activity 
Okmok is one of the most active calderas in North America and the Aleutians. During the 19th century, Okmok reportedly erupted in 1805, 1817, 1824–1830, 1878 and 1899. About a dozen eruptions took place during the last century, averaging one eruption every 10–20 years. Historical activity has occurred at cinder cones within the caldera; they emplaced lava flows and volcanic ash fallout on the caldera floor. Sometimes, the Tulik vent is mistakenly assumed to be active. Eruptions reach VEI of 2–4; larger events can have impacts outside of the caldera. The 1878 eruption has been associated with a tsunami. The 1981 eruption may have caused sulfate deposition in Greenland. The entire volcano uplifts at a rate of a few centimeters per year, only to deflate shortly before and during the 1997 and 2008 eruptions.

 1817 CE and Cone A activity 
The largest eruption in historical time took place in March 1817. During this eruption, lava flows dammed a  lake in the caldera. The lava dam failed, causing a  flood that destroyed an Aleut village at Cape Tanak. According to the geologist Constantin von Grewingk, the inhabitants had been away fishing while the eruption took place; when they returned, they abandoned the original site of the village in favour of a new one, presumably Nikolski. This eruption took place at a  long fissure at the northern caldera margin, forming Cone B and a maar. Apart from the flood, base surges and pyroclastic fall took place outside of the caldera.

Cone A began to grow after the 1817 eruption and became the site of subsequent, mostly effusive eruptions. The 1945, 1958 and 1997 eruptions emplaced large lava flows on the caldera floor, partly overriding each other. In 1945, a  long lava flow was produced which changed course when reaching a glacier. The 1958 lava flow reached a length of  and dammed a drainage, forming a lake.

 1997 CE 
On the February 13, 1997, Cone A erupted, producing - high columns of ash and steam. The eruption had a Hawaiian to Strombolian character and lasted two-five months. Lava flowed north-northeastward from Cone A to form three lobes; a first lobe to the northeast, a second to the north-northeast and a small flow to the west. At the end, lava covered about  of the caldera floor with up to  thick aa lava. This eruption has been cited as an example of the usefulness of satellite imagery for detecting volcanic activity in the Aleutians, as (along with reports by pilots) satellites saw the thermal anomalies associated with precursory activity.

The lava flow reached a total volume of . It was smaller than the 1958 one, was still hot in 2003, melting snow and producing steam. Surface deformation data imply that the eruption was fed from a reservoir not directly underneath cone A, moving towards the cone during the two-three years before the 1997 eruption. Over the following six years, about half of the magma erupted in 1997 was replaced.

 2008 CE 

The last eruption of Okmok was in 2008. On July 12 at 14:36 UTC, a first earthquake was recorded. Four hours later, seismic activity notably increased. At 19:43 UTC, seismic tremor indicated the beginning of the eruption and by 20:00 a volcanic ash cloud became visible in satellite images. The ash cloud grew during the following hours; three hours later, a white cloud rose from above the ash cloud, and the height of the clouds declined. The next day, two volcanic clouds were rising from Okmok, with a white (water-rich) cloud streaming east-southeast and a darker ash-rich one southeastward. The cloud height fluctuated between  and originated from multiple vents on the caldera floor before activity became limited to one crater west of Cone D by August. Eventually, ash emissions and then the seismic activity ceased in August. The tremor lasted for about 12 hours, the eruption itself continued for five weeks.

The eruption was notable for its lack of forewarning; precursory activity lasted a very short time and activity commenced by surprise. The Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) was alerted by the US Coast Guard after the latter received requests for assistance from a family living on the eastern side of Okmok. Alerted by noises, the population of Umnak fled, first by helicopter then by boat.

The 2008 eruption was unusual, being a rare phreatic-Plinian eruption considerably larger than previous eruptions. It was probably triggered by the entry of new basaltic magma into an older basaltic andesite magma body under Cone D left stranded there for the past 1,000–2,000 years. Interaction with water from the lake north of Cone D and groundwater made the eruption cloud water-rich, and thus difficult to detect by remote sensing techniques typically used to detect volcanic eruptions. Fine ash formed aggregates that fell out as an ""ash rain"" or ""ash mist"", reducing its long-distance spread. The cloud reached the stratosphere, leading to disturbances in air travel that were however dwarfed by the disruptions caused by the eruption of Kasatochi that same year. Ash fall into the Pacific Ocean drove a brief phytoplankton bloom, recognizable through increased chlorophyll concentrations. The eruption produced lightning, atmospheric gravity waves and infrasound,  away from Okmok. Whistlers (a type of electromagnetic emission) produced by lightning of the eruption were noted at Dunedin, New Zealand, on the other side of Earth. Pumice from Okmok was carried to Aiktak Island by the sea.

The eruption ranks as 4 on the VEI, and produced about 0.1 teragrams of sulfur, which were detected over Europe but did not affect climate. Several new craters formed west and north of Cone D, which was disrupted; some of the new craters filled with water after and during the eruption. When groundwater drained into the active vents, the waterlogged ground collapsed in some places, forming pit craters. The eruption covered parts of the caldera floor with metres-thick wet tephra and rearranged the waterbodies inside the caldera. Mudflows descended the drainages on the island, damaging bridges and forming deltas at their mouths in the ocean. The newly formed vents were rapidly degraded by erosion.

 Fumarolic activity 
Weak fumarolic activity occurs at the recently active vents, especially after rainfall. Their emissions consist mostly of carbon dioxide, hydrogen and nitrogen, while lacking sulfur. Prolonged fumarolic activity has emplaced fumarole minerals and weathered rock to clay. The composition of the gases indicates that they originate from a hydrothermal system that traps more acidic components like sulfur compounds.

Hot springs existed at the northern foot of Cone D, producing more than  of  warm water. The 1958 eruption submerged them beneath a lake, during the 2008 eruption they were flooded completely although later some re-emerged. Additional hot springs were found in creeks entering the Cone D lake. A field of geysers and sinter deposits may be linked to Okmok, and the caldera has been evaluated as a site for the generation of geothermal power.

 Hazards and monitoring 
Okmok has had large caldera-forming eruptions. Its eruptions constitute a threat to air travel, which despite the remoteness of the volcano is heavy in the region. Okmok is classified as a ""high-threat volcano"" by the United States Geological Service. The AVO operates seismometers and equipment measuring deformation of the edifice, which relay their information to the AVO laboratories in Fairbanks and Anchorage. AVO publishes a volcano alert level for Okmok. The volcano is also the site of an array of infrasound detectors, which can also record activity at other Aleutian volcanoes.

The principal hazard from Okmok consists in volcanic ash clouds, which are transported mostly eastward by winds. Ash clouds can damage aircraft and their engines and ash fallout to the ground can cause breathing difficulties, low visibility, and damage to machinery. Pyroclastic flows and surges can scour the island, overtop ridges and topographic obstacles, and advance at speeds reaching . Rockfalls and slow-moving lava flows primarily occur inside the caldera. The latter can dam creeks, causing floods down Crater Creek. Ash or pyroclastic fall onto ice can produce mudflows and volcanic cones outside of the caldera may be a source of debris flows. Inside the caldera, dangerous volcanic gases occur next to fumaroles and odorless toxic gases can built up in geographic depressions. Large caldera-forming eruptions are unlikely in the near future.

 Scientific importance 
The 1945 eruption threatened Fort Glenn, drawing attention to Okmok and Aleutian volcanoes in general. Interest in Okmok stagnated afterwards until the 1997 eruption renewed scientific attention, which made Okmok one of the best studied Aleutian volcanoes. An algorithm that processes satellite-derived thermal images of the ground to identify anomalous areas, was developed after the 1996 Pavlof eruption and renamed ""Okmok Algorithm"" after the 1997 eruption of Okmok, to which it was first applied.",2025-03-13,"['21st-century volcanic events' 'Active volcanoes' 'Calderas of Alaska'

798,3018,75060032,5261,Beryl Guertner,"Beryl Annie Blanche Guertner (October 22, 1917 – November 25, 1981) was an Australian magazine editor and author. She led Australian House and Garden for 25 years.

Life
Guertner was born in 1917 in Paddington. Her parents were Maude (born Ireland) and her husband Eugene Henry Gürtner. Her mother was from Sydney and her father was a German immigrant cook and masseur. She was educated at a school in Wagga Wagga run by the Presentation Sisters. When she 21 she moved to the Sydney suburb of Mosman Bay and she went to work for the Daily Telegraph.

The first edition of Australian House and Garden was in December 1948. It was the idea of Ken Murray of the K.G. Murray Publishing Company and it had been put together in less than four months. The first editor was Guertner who was an enthusiast for interior design and gardening. The magazine championed the interior design advocate Marion Hall Best, the architects Robin Boyd and Harry Seidler and furniture designer Grant Featherston. The magazine included plans for complete small homes designed by W. Watson Sharp as well as suggesting the latest colours for interiors.

She was a member of the Society of Women Writers of New South Wales and she became its president in 1960. In the same year, her book Australian Book of Furnishing and Decorating was published.

Her magazine's long collaboration with the architect, W. Watson Sharp, led to, The Australian House and Garden Book of Orchids, a book by him that sold under the name of the magazine in 1969.

Guertner was editor of Australian House and Garden until 1973 when she retired. She had lived with Catherine (Kate) Warmoll from 1949 at Warrimoo. The two of them moved to live at MacMasters Beach beside Cockrone lagoon.

Death and legacy
Guertner died in Gosford in 1981. An online version and a print edition of the magazine, she helped found, continues (2023).",2024-01-16,"['1917 births' '1981 deaths' 'People from Sydney'

799,56028,76587054,15180,Isa Melsheimer,"Isa Melsheimer (born September 19, 1968, in Neuss) is a German sculptor, object and installation artist, painter and university lecturer.

 Life 
Isa Melsheimer grew up on a vineyard in Reil on the Moselle. From 1991 to 1997, she studied painting at the Hochschule der Künste Berlin (now Berlin University of the Arts) in the Georg Baselitz master class.

After a substitute semester in Björn Dahlem's class at the Bauhaus University Weimar and a guest professorship for experimental drawing at the Braunschweig University of Art, she has been Professor of Ceramics in the Fine Arts program at the Muthesisus Academy of Fine Arts in Kiel since the winter semester 2022.

Isa Melsheimer lives and works in Berlin.

 Work 
In her artistic work, Isa Melsheimer deals with the built environment and explores the conditions for its design and adjustment. She is interested in the history of the architectural styles – especially the legacy of Modernism and the 1950s-70s examples of concrete architecture – as well as the influence of humans on nature.
One focus of her work is on surreal, often fragile living landscapes and improvised dwellings.

Melsheimer's site-specific installations playfully puzzle architectural and urban spaces by mixing subjective memories, current events, symbols, and metaphors. In exhibitions, she displays spatial tension made of strings inspired by shell structures, for example.

Another series of works are gouaches in which architectural and design icons are quoted and, together with natural motifs (animals, plants), mutate into fantastic spaces.

Isa Melsheimer works with simple materials such as ceramics, concrete, glass, metal, wood, but also with yarn and fabric, plants, furnishings, and everyday objects.

802,24878,5320045,21269,Lyn Duff,"Lyn Duff, now principally known as Athena Kolbe, (born 1976) is an American journalist and college professor. Her career began in eighth grade with an underground school newspaper and has continued in various written and audio mediums. After being forced into anti-gay conversion therapy by her mother she escaped. She has done extensive reporting in Israel and Haiti. She speaks out for youth rights and criticizes certain mental health systems. She was affiliated with Flashpoints, an evening drive-time public affairs show heard daily on Pacifica Radio. She is now an assistant professor of social work at Barry University.

 Early years 

Born in California in 1976, Duff began her journalistic career as the founder of an underground school newspaper, The Tiger Club, while an 8th grader at South Pasadena Junior High School in 1989. After five published issues, she was suspended from school by the principal for refusing to stop disseminating the newspaper.

After gaining help from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the South Pasadena Unified School District agreed to allow her to return to school. She completed her 8th grade year and was then accepted as an early entrance student to California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA), which she attended for a year and a half.

While at CSULA Duff was on staff of an alternative newspaper published by Los Angeles art critic Mat Gleason who, at the time, was a graduate student in the school of journalism and president of an alternative Greek organization, Omega Omega Omega, and later went on to publish Coagula Art Journal.

Involuntary conversion therapy
In 1991, Duff, then fourteen, came out publicly as lesbian.

Concerned about her daughter's sexual orientation, Duff's mother had her admitted to Rivendell Psychiatric Center (now called Copper Hills Youth Center) in West Jordan, Utah. Duff was admitted to Rivendell Psychiatric Center on December 19, 1991, at age 15.

During the drive from California to Utah, Duff covertly called journalist and friend Bruce Mirken who then wrote for both the LA Weekly and The Advocate.  Although 30 years her senior, the two nevertheless had had plans to meet for dinner prior to her therapy stay, and upon hearing of her situation, Mirken phoned a public interest legal aid society that secured pro bono services of corporate attorney Gina M. Calabrese of the Los Angeles firm Adams, Duque & Hazeltine.

Although Rivendell was not affiliated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Duff later said that she was visited by Mormon missionaries during her six months at the Utah psychiatric facility and that the treatment she received was heavily influenced by religion. Duff says that Rivendell therapists told her that a gay and lesbian orientation was caused by negative experiences with people of the opposite gender and that having a lesbian sexual identity would lead to sexually abusing other people or engaging in bestiality. Duff was diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder (GID) and clinical depression. Duff was subjected to a regimen of conversion therapy. This involved aversion therapy, which consisted of being forced to watch same-sex pornography while smelling ammonia. She was also subjected to hypnosis, psychotropic drugs, solitary confinement, and therapeutic messages linking lesbian sex with ""the pits of hell"". Behavior modification techniques were also used, including requiring girls to wear dresses and harsh punishment for small infractions similar to hazing like having to cut the lawn with small scissors and scrubbing floors with a toothbrush, and ""positive peer pressure"" group sessions in which patients demeaned and belittled each other for both real and perceived inadequacies.

On May 19, 1992, after 168 days of treatment, Duff escaped from Rivendell and traveled to San Francisco, where she lived on the streets and in safe houses.

Emancipation and adoption

In late 1992, with the help of Legal Services for Children and the National Center for Lesbian Rights, and with legal assistance provided by the National Center for Youth Law, Duff petitioned the courts to have her mother's parental rights terminated. She was one of a handful of children who divorced their parents that year. In October 1992, a lesbian couple in San Francisco adopted Duff. She lived with them until the age of eighteen, when she began living independently and returned to college.

Youth rights activism
From 1992 through 1998, Duff was an outspoken critic of the mental health system, appearing on CNN, ABC's 20/20, and numerous print, radio and television media outlets. She also spoke at a number of human rights, civil rights, mental health and youth services conferences about her experiences and the rights of young people to live free of discrimination and oppression on the basis of their sexual orientation. Showing Duff as speaker. During these years she also served on the board of several national organizations including the National Center for Youth Law (board member 1994–2001) and the National Child Rights Alliance (board member 1992–1993, board chairperson 1994–1999). In 1996, Duff was honored as a keynote speaker and given a human rights award at the international conference of the Metropolitan Community Church.

During these same years, Duff was emerging as a journalist in her own right, writing for Youth Outlook, a column in The San Francisco Examiner, and Pacific News Service. She joined the staff of Flashpoints, a daily hour-long drive-time show broadcast on Pacifica Radio's KPFA in 1994. Her writings have appeared in the San Francisco Chronicle, The San Francisco Examiner, Salon, Utne Reader, Sassy, The Washington Post, Seventeen, the Miami Herald and the National Catholic Reporter.

In 1995, Duff traveled to Haiti, where she established Radyo Timoun (""Children's Radio""), that country's first radio station run entirely by children under the age of seventeen. She reportedly worked closely with Haitian President Jean Bertrand Aristide.

In 1998, Duff graduated with a BA in international affairs and labor law from Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York.

 International journalism 
By the late 1990s, Duff was a well-established international journalist with postings in Haiti, Israel, Croatia, several African countries, and Vietnam. After the United States invaded Afghanistan, she traveled to the front lines as one of the few non-embedded Western journalists.

In early 2000 she began to cover religious affairs from her posting in Jerusalem, writing widely on the problems and conflicts between Christians, Jews, and Muslims. In 2002, Duff earned an MA in Theology.

In February 2004, Duff, who was then living six months out of every year in Jerusalem, was home in the United States on a brief visit when a group of ex-soldiers overthrew the democratically elected government of Haiti. She quickly traveled to Haiti, arriving in Port-au-Prince when the coup was only days old and reporting on the situation extensively for several national media outlets.

During 2004–2006, Duff regularly covered the situation in Haiti for San Francisco Bay View, Pacifica Radio's Flashpoints, and Pacific News Service. Her reporting is a blend of in-depth investigative reports and ""as told to"" first person commentaries by Haitian nationals. Subjects have included politically motivated mass rape, the United Nations mission in Haiti, killings by American Marines in Port-au-Prince, civilians taking over the neighborhood of Bel Air and murders of street children by police and ex-soldiers.

Academic career

The latter work was featured by novelist John Updike in his book Roger's Version, in which the antagonist, Dale, adopts philosophical positions described in Gale's work on Leibniz and the Anthropic Principle. Working with the physicist John Urani, a series of papersUrani, John and George Gale, 'E. A. Milne and the Origins of Modern Cosmology: An Essential Presence', in The Attraction of Gravitation: New Studies in the History of General Relativity (Einstein Studies, vol. 5), edited by John Earman, Michel Janssen and John D. Norton (Boston, 1993), 390–419.Gale, George and John Urani, ""Milne, Bondi, and the 'Second Way' to Cosmology,"" in H. Goenner (ed.), The Expanding Worlds of General Relativity, Boston: Birkhauser, pp.343-77. re-writing the history of modern cosmology was published, demonstrating the central role played by the cosmologist A. E. Milne. One of their papers was chosen as an ""Editor's Choice: Paper of 1998-2001"" in the American Journal of Physics. Following this, Gale turned his attention to the history and philosophy of agriculture, specifically viticulture—based upon his earlier experiences as a vineyard and winery owner, and wine columnist for the Kansas City Star. His turn to viticulture was natural, as he explained: ""Philosophy is kind of abstract; I had to get into something sticky and gooey."" His book on the phylloxera disaster devastating vineyards worldwide was a finalist for several awards. He continues his work in viticultural research and consulting.

 Biography 
Gale attended Northern California's La Sierra High School. Using a scholarship from Aerojet-General he attended Santa Clara University, graduating with a BA in Philosophy and a senior thesis ""Finality in Teilhard's Phenomenon of Man"". During his time at Santa Clara, Gale worked summers at Aerojet on the Minuteman missile program. In Fall 1965 Gale began MA studies at San Francisco State, and teaching and administering the lab students in the Woodrow Wilson High School's Lux Laboratory Enrichment Program. He graduated in 1967 with a thesis ""'Explanation' in Emile Meyerson's Identity and Reality'''"" directed by Russell Kahl.

At this time, Gale had been recruited to become the Executive Secretary and manager of the Ford Foundation project ""Study Group on the Unity of Knowledge"", whose principal investigators were Michael Polanyi and Marjorie Grene. The project was housed at UC Davis where Gale would become a PhD student. For the next five years Gale would manage the affairs of the Study Group's members including J. Brownoski, Charles Taylor, Bert Dreyfus, Alasdair MacIntyre, Robert Cohen, Marx Wartowsky, and others.

In 1970, Gale moved temporarily from Davis to Oxford to work on his dissertation with Rom Harré. In the end, it was Grene who had final say on Gale's dissertation: ""Leibniz: The Physicist as Philosopher"".

Following graduation, Gale went on active duty in the U.S. Army. He had gone through ROTC at Santa Clara, and been commissioned a 2LT in 1965. He did his active duty service at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. He was honorably discharged in 1973 as a Captain.

In Fall of 1971, Gale accepted appointment as assistant professor of physical science and philosophy at the University of Missouri–Kansas City, where he would remain for the next 43 years.

In 1979 he published Theory of Science: An Introduction to the History, Philosophy, and Logic of Science. The book was one of the first introductory texts to base its philosophical development in fully integrated, extensive historical examples. The book reached a wide audience: for example Robin Dunbar used it in a fairly typical manner in a scientific context. In 1981 Gale published in Scientific American the first article introducing the anthropic cosmological principle to the general public. The article was translated into seven languages and received extensive commentary and criticism.

In 1983 Gale was invited to the University of Pittsburgh Center for Philosophy of Science as a Fellow alongside Ron Giere, Tom Nickles, John Worrall and Jim Woodward.

In 1984 Gale was visiting professor in Oxford, teaching (with Rom Harré) the Physics and Philosophy seminar on space and time. In 1986 and 1988 he was visiting professor in Wuhan University, China, teaching graduate students in history and philosophy of science.

Also in 1988, Gale received a National Science Foundation grant to research the origins of big bang cosmology.

In 1994, following the leadership of Don Howard and Alan Richardson, Gale helped found HOPOS, the International Society for the History of Philosophy of Science, serving on the first two steering committees and originating internet support functions to the new group.

In 1996 Gale became the second Executive Secretary/CEO in the history of e Philosophy of Science Association. Gale's brief was to secure financial independence and security for the organization, organize a business office in co-operation with the History of Science Society, oversee movement from self-publication of the society journal to publication by University of Chicago Press, and to organize JSTOR's acquisition of the journal, including finding, collection and submission of the full run of the journal to JSTOR.

In 2011 Gale's Dying on the Vine: How Phylloxera Transformed Wine was published by the University of California Press. The book was well received, with one reviewer proclaiming ""Dying on the vine is now the classic book on the phylloxera.""  When the New York Times'' needed an expert to comment on the role of American vines during the disease plague among French vines, they consulted Gale.

In 2011 Gale was named James C. Olson Professor of Philosophy.https://info.umkc.edu/news/umkc-recognizes-james-c-olson-professors/ He retired from UMKC as emeritus in 2014, and now shares life in Montréal, Québec, and Lake Champlain, NY with his second wife, Dr. Deborah Dysart-Gale.",2025-03-31,['1943 births' 'Living people' 'American historians of philosophy'],"['Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz' 'anthropic principle' 'Many Worlds theory'

807,2625,75054111,5543,Quiet cutting,"Quiet cutting is a strategy from employers where employees are reassigned to a different role rather than being laid off. The term arose in 2023 to describe a phenomenon seen in the American labor market. Although the nation had a strong job market during this time, quiet cutting was being adopted by companies due to economic worries of the future. Companies were observed to use this approach to fulfill crucial roles while simultaneously reducing costs. According to the financial research platform AlphaSense, conversations about reassignments  during corporate earnings calls more than tripled between August 2022 and August 2023. Although the term ""quiet quitting"" was invented in 2023, the strategy had been seen before.

The term ""quiet cutting"" alludes to the term ""quiet quitting"" that was observed in the few years prior where employees would do minimal effort to meet expectations. Where quiet quitting reflected that the balance of workplace power was more favorable for employees, the rise in quiet cutting suggests that the balance may be shifting in favor of employers. The Great Resignation showed a strong demand for workers, job openings and wage growth decreased in 2023. Quiet quitting can be considered a subset of ""quiet firing"".

Employees may experience a range of emotions, from relief at retaining their jobs to fear of the uncertainty of their career paths following reassignments. It may potentially have a negative impact on morale and employee retention. The practice of reassignment often involves a waiting game, subtly encouraging employees to voluntarily leave to avoid costly severance packages. Workers may sometimes be deliberately placed in ill-fitting roles, prompting them to resign. The roles may be less prestigious, lower paying, and more demanding. Indicators such as reduced pay or unwanted relocation may suggest such underlying motives. Experts recommend that employees seek clarity from management regarding the specifics behind their reassignments to gain a better understanding of their career trajectory. Transparency on the part of the employer is a key factor in maintaining a respectable relationship with employees. In situations involving reassignment, legal options for employees are limited, except in cases of retaliatory or discriminatory treatment. It may be more practical and effective for the employer to directly terminate the employee rather than engaging in quiet cutting.

809,23420,75650770,9131,Richard Lee Bugbee,"Richard Lee Bugbee (February 6, 1948 – October 15, 2023) was a Native American of the Payómkawichum (Luiseño) people and culture keeper and ethnobotany instructor in San Diego, California.

 Early life 
Bugbee attributed his love of plants to his cowboy grandfather, John Peters.Wilderutopia.com https://wilderutopia.com/ecojustice-radio/ethnobotany-cultural-fire-and-indigenous-stewardship-with-layconkawish-elder-richard-bugbee/ (accessed 2023-12-23.

Bugbee attended five high schools as the family moved. Having never gotten a college degree, Bugbee took courses at Santa Monica, Grossmont, Cuyamaca, Mira Mesa, Palomar, Fresno City, and San Diego City Colleges.

As a young adult in the mid-1960s, he became a psychedelic light technician. This specialty led to numerous interactions with musicians including Janis Joplin, Alice Cooper, Canned Heat, and the Grateful Dead.

 Career 
Starting in 2005, Bugbee began his academic career as an instructor of Kumeyaay Ethnobotany and Ethnoecology at Cuyamaca College through Kumeyaay and Cuyamaca Community Colleges. Jane Dumas assisted with the course until her death in 2014. For this class, Bugbee and Dumas wrote “Kumeyaay Ethnobotany Reader,"" a widely disseminated 92-page document of names, uses, and botanical characteristics of the most widely used plants. This work led Bugbee into being a consultant for published books on plant uses.Largo, Donna, McCarthy, D.F., and Roper, Marcia, 2009, Medicinal plants used by Native American tribes in Southern California: Malki-Ballena Press, 57 p.Energetic Herbalism Maier, Kat, 2021, Energetic Herbalism: A Guide to Sacred Plant Traditions Integrating Elements: Chelsea Green Publishing.

Bugbee also taught indigenous material cultures and traditional plant uses of southern California at many museums including the Oakland Museum of California and the Phoebe Hearst Museum at UC Berkeley, at botanical gardens, and on Indian reservations. He was an instructor for summer cultural programs for several Kumeyaay tribes and for Intertribal Youth/Native Like Water. His stated goal was to use indigenous knowledge to serve as a bridge that connects the wisdom of the Elders with today's youth.

As a museum curator and educator, Bugbee was Curator of the Kumeyaay Culture Exhibit at the Southern Indian Health Council (1994–2004), the Associate Director/Curator of the San Diego American Indian Culture Center & Museum, and the Indigenous Education Specialist for the San Diego Museum of Man/Us (1989–2005).

Bugbee was a member of the Native American Council for California State Parks (1991–1995), California Indian Basketweavers’ Association (CIBA), the Land Conservancy, and the Elder's Circle for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (2006–2008). A 2009 Alliance for California Traditional Arts (ACTA) fellowship created an opportunity for him to teach the traditional tribal sport of Waw’lish.

Being an important member of the indigenous community led to invitations to join the Board of Directors of organizations such as the Board of Indigenous Regeneration (Mata’Yuum). As a language advocate, Bugbee was chairman of the board of directors for the Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival (AICLS) (2000–2023), where he was associate director and curator of the American Indian Culture Center and Museum in San Diego, as well as Director and Curator of the Kumeyaay Culture Center and exhibit at the Southern Indian Health Council. In 2016 he was featured in episode five, ""Gathering Medicine"", of the PBS program Tending the Wild about native land practices in California.

Bugbee was the ethnobotanist for the Traditional Indian Health Program through Riverside-San Bernardino (Counties) Indian Health providing information on the interactions between traditional plant and pharmaceutical medicines. Most recently, Bugbee was chosen for the Elder's Indigenous Climate Fellow (2020–2021) for the San Diego Climate Science Alliance, where he provided guidance and direction for the Climate Science Alliance Tribal Working Group.

The important lesson he shared from Elder Jane Dumas involved proper behavior when picking plants. When you pick a plant “ask for permission, tell your intent for the plant, and say a prayer for the plant.""

 Personal life 
Bugbee had four children, Jason C. and Ginger Lee with his former wife, Carol Renn Bugbee, and Cheyenne and Heather C. with Kelly Ann Dewolf.

In 1980, he met Kumeyaay elder Jane Dumas, an ethnobotanist from Jamul Indian Village who was the daughter of famous Kumeyaay healer, Isobel Thing. Within two years, she had accepted Bugbee as her apprentice when he showed a true interest in healing plants.

From 1990 to 1992, he led a group of Native American dancers to Brisbane, Australia, forming the dance ensemble Mak’sho which included the Munajali Yogumbeh (Australian) and Te Ahwina (New Zealand) traditional people.

810,39066,76114092,11778,Combined Opposition Parties,"The Combined Opposition Parties (COP) was a Pakistani coalition of 6-13 political parties founded in 1965, to run in the 1965 presidential, and general election against field marshal Ayub Khan and his authoritarian regime.

The COP was founded in attempt to challenge the controversial leader Ayub Khan in the then upcoming election. The COP accused Ayub Khan of bad governance and being anti-democratic. The COP advocated for an end to the martial law which had been imposed by Ayub Khan since 1958.

 Members 
The exact number of parties in the Combined Opposition is not exactly known but studies claim it consisted of the 5,6 or 13 leading opposition parties, the party members included the Socialist National Awami Party (NAP) led by Maulana Bashani, and its northwestern faction, the National Awami Party (Wali) led by Abdul Wali Khan, The Islamist party, the Jamaat-e-Islami led by the popular Abul A'la Maududi, the Council Muslim League led by Khawaja Nazimuddin in opposition to Ayub Khan, the lesser-known Niazam-e-Islam Party of Chaudhry Mohammad Ali and the East Pakistani Awami League led by Mujibur Rehman.

The fact that many of these party members' ideologies were contradictory, demonstrated that Ayub Khan's policies were extremely unpopular.

 Foundation 
Khawaja Nazimuddin, president of the Council Muslim League, traveled Pakistan, and met with the leaders of various political groups, he talked about the political state of affairs as the presidential election of January 1965 was getting closer. Talks began between major political movements and parties throughout the country for a united front in politics.

As a result, on July 21, 1964, in Dhaka, the opposition parties united to form the Combined Opposition Parties (COP).

 Party leadership 
The COP did not have one exclusive leader, as it was a coalition of several parties with independent leaders. When the 1965 elections took place, It was disputed who should have run for president on behalf of the COP against Ayub Khan, the Left-wing parties such as the NAP and NAP(W) clashed with the Right-wing Jamaat-e-Islami, causing neither side to reach a clear candidate. Khawaja Nazimuddin was thought of as the best option but his elderly condition hindered any idea of party leadership,Younas. Siasi Ittehad, p.68. This idea was strongly opposed keeping in view the falling health of Nawabzada Nazimuddin. therefore it was decided that Fatima Jinnah would run for president due to her neutrality in ideology among the differing parties, as well as due to the fact that she was instrumental in Pakistan's creation and she was the sister of Pakistan's founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah.

Fatima Jinnah led the campaign against Ayub Khan in 1965 and urged Pakistanis to vote with care in the elections, and became a serious contender against Ayub's campaign and his party, the Convention Muslim League.

 Ideology 
The Combined Opposition parties laid out their nine points as an official manifesto and ideological principle in 1964. Chaudhry Muhammad Ali unveiled the following points for the parties ideology:

Other than the nine official points, the party was strictly Anti-Ayub Khan, accusing him of founding a military dictatorship. The COP advocated for an establishment of a Parliamentary Democracy in the country where the Constituent assembly was re-empowered, the party also held Islamic tendencies, due to membership by the Jamaat-e-Islami and Maududi.

Ayub Khan responded to the 9-point manifesto by establishing his own manifesto of industrialism, growth, secularism and the self-determination guarantee to Kashmiris.This included the freedom of speech, freedom of association and freedom of assembly under the rule of law. Hamdani, Fatima Jinnah , pp. 88 — 90

 Challenges 

Since the COP's inception, the party has faced criticism, challenges and crackdowns by Ayub Khan's government. Ayub Khan accused Miss Jinnah of being a weak leader and that she was being exploited by the COP's power hungry, corrupt leaders.

Her campaign was plagued with unfair and unequal election campaign, poor finances, and indirect elections through the  Democratic System were some of the primary problems she faced. However, she had overwhelming support among the public.

 Decline 

 1965 election results 

The election results came in favor of the incumbent President Ayub Khan, who, despite losing the popular vote, won 62.43% of the Electoral vote. Fatima Jinnah won 35.86% of the electoral college votes. Jinnah was however extremely successful in some areas of the country. She had swept across major urban centres such as Karachi and Dhaka. Ayub also faced disappointing results in East Pakistan. However, Ayub had decisively triumphed in rural Pakistan. As majority of the Electoral College consisted of representatives from the rural setup, Ayub was able to win a clear majority.

The election results were not accepted by the Combined Opposition Parties, who accused Ayub of rigging. The COP staged demonstrations and protests, however, didn't gain much public support as Fatimah Jinnah, accepted the election results. The Election had an effective result. It further strengthened the role of Women in politics in Pakistan.

 Dissolution 
The COP discussed in sessions following the presidential election to determine the course of action for the next national and provincial assembly elections. The leaders of this session discussed boycotting the elections as being unrealistic.

The alliance COP extremely disappointed with the results of these elections, which were a total failure. The reason for this was because COP lost motivation following the presidential election and ran a grudgingly for office. The defeat of COP in the presidential and subsequent national and provincial assembles elections did not render the organization useless.

814,56034,76587189,48166,Gymnastic and Sports Federation of French Patronages,"The Gymnastic and Sports Federation of French Patronages (in French, Fédération gymnastique et sportive des patronages de France, FGSPF) is a French multi-sports federation established in 1898 in Paris by Dr. Paul Michaux. Initially known as the Union of Gymnastics and Military Instruction Societies of French Patronages and Youth Organizations, it changed its name to the Federation of Catholic Gymnastics Societies in 1901 before adopting its current name in 1903. During the Occupation, it integrated the women's organization of the Women's Sports Rayon. It formally merged with it in 1947, evolving into the Sports Federation of France and later the Sports and Cultural Federation of France in 1968.

The FGSPF, as indicated by its acronyms, is primarily a gymnastics federation, competing with the Union of Gymnastics Societies of France. The latter is closely associated with the League of Patriots and the Ligue de l'enseignement (League of Education), both of which promote secular or even anti-clerical values. The FGSPF also competes with the Union of French Athletic Sports Societies, especially when it expands its focus to include other sports, especially football. This sport quickly became the reference sport for the FGSPF, leading to the organization of the FGSPF Football Championship from 1904 to 1914. In 1908, the FGSPF successfully established the French Interfederal Committee, created a year earlier, as the sole federation recognized by the International Federation of Association Football.

The emergence of specialized sports federations after World War I did not seem to pose any problems for the FGSPF, unlike the USFSA, which disappeared from the national scene. The FGSPF even experienced exceptional growth during this period, especially in basketball.

 History 

In 1891, Pope Leo XIII's encyclical Rerum novarum legitimized and strengthened Catholic parish patronages, which established a tradition of running, ball games, stilts, and later gymnastics for nearly a century. Subsequently, anti-clericalism promoted by the Union of Gymnastics Societies of France (USGF) prompted the French episcopate to consider organizing its gymnastic followers into a specific association. During the Patronage Day on December 15, 1897, at the Catholic Institute of Paris, the rector, Mgr Péchenard, therefore proposed a physical exercise competition for the diocesan patronages of Paris. The project was embarrassed by the assembly, and Dr. Paul Michaux, along with another doctor, Dr. Fayet, and a few priests, including Father Louis Esquerré, the patronage of the Bon Conseil work in 1894, immediately formed a team to implement the project.

In the following year,Dreyfus affair year Dr. Michaux successfully obtained the creation of an organization from the patronage committee, which was later named the Union of Gymnastics and Military Instruction Societies of Patronages and Youth Organizations (USGIMPOJF). This was replaced in October 1901 by the Federation of Catholic Gymnastics Societies (FSCG). The first competition took place on July 24, 1898, in Paris, under the chairmanship of Rear Admiral Mathieu with 3,000 spectators. The second competition, held in June of the following year in Ivry and attended by 1,200 gymnasts, including participants from the North, Le Havre, and Reims, was graced by the presence of Albert Mun. In 1900, the Paris Universal Exposition awarded its Grand Prize for Social Works to a presentation of the new federation by Pierre Griffaton, who was also a co-disciple in the Nazareth work. The fourth competition, in 1901, gathered 2,000 gymnasts  and attracted 8,000 spectators.

This institution is dedicated to apostolic, hygienic, and patriotic goals, in line with the ideas of prominent physiologists such as Claude Bernard, Étienne Marey, and Paul Bert, following the aftermath of the French defeat in 1870. Gymnastics, already practiced in patronages since Timon-David, is considered essential for achieving these objectives. Minister Paul Bert assigns it the task of bridging the gap of several years between students leaving compulsory primary school at 13 and their military incorporation. To achieve this, every teacher spends three months at the military gymnastics school of Joinville focusing on fencing and gymnastics.

Gathered from October 25 to 28, 1903, at the Catholic Institute of Paris, the central commission of the patronages of France, then chaired by Dr. Michaux himself, expresses -the wish ""that in each region, directors should agree to organize regional or departmental unions of gymnastics and sports societies"" and ""that the training of members of our Catholic patronages be so manly and strongly Christian that, if necessary, they can participate in gymnastics competitions organized by other societies, even non-denominational ones."" Sport also quickly makes its appearance with the consideration of football as early as 1901 and running in 1903. The federation considered this, and on December 14, 1903, it was renamed the Gymnastic and Sports Federation of French Patronages. That same year, the first issue of the journal Les Jeunes is published. In 1904, the federation organized its first cross-country race and federal athletics championship in Saint-Cloud, followed by the first federal congress of the Commission of Patronages. Les Jeunes, initially an insert in the Patronage magazine, became an independent weekly publication in March 1905. The federation relocated to its first premises at 5 Place Saint-Thomas-d’Aquin on July 15, with Léon Lamoureux assuming administrative responsibilities on November 14, later joined by Charles Simon.

 Gymnastics, Football, War (1898–1918) 

However, gymnastics continued to provide an avenue for Catholics to participate in patriotic events, with large competitions attracting associations from various provinces to Paris. Despite this, the federation's growth remained limited until 1906. The turning point came in 1908 when hostility from authorities and other federations towards associations that had participated in gymnastics competitions in Rome in 1906, in response to the pope's invitation, led to a surge in membership in the FGSPF. For instance, the Lyon region, with its own Federation of Catholic Gymnastics Societies of the Rhône and the southeast, joined that year. Some associations joined later, possibly due to pressure from their diocese hierarchy, such as the Federation of Gymnastics Societies of the North in 1912.

This situation, which irritates anticlericals, is not without risks. In September 1904, Father Deschamps' troops escorted Émile Combes, President of the Council, to the Auxerre train station with fanfare, causing annoyance. However, on June 8, 1907, the Saint-Joseph des Épinettes event resulted in one fatality and two serious injuries. The competition in Roubaix on July 11, 1911, attracted 50,000 spectators and 8,000 gymnasts, but also faced opposition from 3,000 anti-clerical protesters, requiring 400 gendarmes to be reinforced by two squadrons of dragoons and two police brigades. It was a war period, and the situation persisted because three weeks before the declaration of the Great War, on July 12, 1914, in Roanne, an enthusiastic prefect mobilized the army and had a parade charged by the mobile guard on the pretext that priests accompanied it. Nevertheless, alliances are multiplying, especially in the provinces, and on October 8, 1910, in Chantilly, a society from Bordeaux, La Flèche, won the first federal gymnastics championship. The following year, 43 regional unions and 1,250 affiliated societies participated in the 9th federal congress.

In solidarity with the French provinces annexed to Germany, two competitions were organized in Nancy in 1907 and 1911. The second competition saw the participation of societies from Alsace, Belgium, Holland (province of the Netherlands), Ireland, Italy, and Canada. The FGSPF brought together 8,500 athletes in the Lorraine capital during this event. The 25 foreign delegations present established the International Union of Catholic Physical Education Works (UIOCEP), which later evolved into the International Catholic Federation of Physical and Sports Education (FICEP) in 1947. Paul Michaux served as vice president, and Charles Simon as secretary-general. In December 1911, this union convened in Rome to establish its statutes with the encouragement of Pope Pius XI.

In twelve years, the FGSPF has successfully united most parish and congregation patronages with charitable missions. However, patronages associated with educational institutions catering to the elite have largely remained outside its sphere of influence. The FGSPF aimed to bridge the gap between working-class and educated youth through sports, making it the first French federation to focus on school sports. The Gymnastic and Sports Union of Free Education was established on February 10, 1911, with René Barbier de la Serre, officially declared on March 29, 1911, and later evolved into the General Sports Union of Free Education (UGSEL) in 1935. The conquest of this sector proved laborious, as it had already been largely prospected by the Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques (USFSA) for over 20 years, as the story of Father Henri Didon and his Albert-le-Grand d'Arcueil institute testifies. The FGSPF, which had 13 affiliated clubs at the end of 1898, registered 1,504 in 1914 compared with 1,100 and 1,700 respectively for its rivals, the USGF and USFSA. Its numbers made it France's leading sports movement, and in the post-war years membership rapidly doubled.

Dr. Michaux, motivated by the desire to reclaim Alsace and Lorraine, made military preparation and marksmanship a top priority for the federation. In 1914, one in three recipients of the Military Aptitude Certificate trained within the FGSPF. The organization suffered the loss of 25,000 members who fell on the battlefield during World War I, including many leaders and priest-directors. By November 1914, Paul Michaux estimated that over 50,000 youth from patronages were serving in the military. Despite the challenges, the FGSPF continued its activities, and Paul Michaux successfully organized the first post-war competition in a major city restored to France: 7,000 gymnasts from across the country gathered in Metz on August 4, 1919.

The majority of French sports groups, including many patronages and religious school establishments, have long been affiliated with the USFSA, which has specialized commissions for each discipline. While its leaders are passionate about football-rugby, they have been more hesitant towards association football, which is already popular among professional athletes in the UK but is also widely practiced in the courtyards of presbyteries. The new Federation of Catholic Gymnastics Societies could no longer ignore this sport, as it was mentioned in its January 1900 bulletin and initial meetings were organized the following year. To assert its legitimacy in addressing football, the federation changed its name to the Gymnastic and Sports Federation of French Patronages in 1903. It then organized its own FGSPF Football Championship in the following year, which lasted for ten seasons before being interrupted by the war and eventually faded away in favor of the creation of the Charles Simon Cup in 1917. Only a federal championship persisted after that.

Faced with mounting challenges, the general secretary, Charles Simon, spearheaded the establishment of the French Interfederal Committee (CFI) in 1907. He secured individual memberships from USFSA members who supported football. The inaugural CFI championship in 1907 featured a trophy donated by Pierre de Coubertin. The new memberships were not without motive: the USFSA, after a dramatic exit from the International Association Football Federation (FIFA) in 1908, promptly aligned with the CFI, which became France's sole representative organization. In 1912, the CFI made the strategic decision to focus exclusively on association football.

The headquarters of the CFI remained at the same location as the FGSPF: 5 Place Saint-Thomas-d'Aquin in Paris. On June 15, 1915, Charles Simon passed away while on duty, and Henri Delaunay took over his responsibilities at the FGSPF and the CFI. On January 5, 1917, they decided to honor the fallen hero by naming the French Football Cup after him. The CFI was officially renamed the French Football Federation (FFF) on April 7, 1919, with Jules Rimet as president and Henri Delaunay as general secretary. Delaunay was succeeded at the FGSPF by Armand Thibaudeau, who played a key role in the establishment of the French Federation of Basketball (FFBB).

During the conflict, the FGSPF contributed some of its members to the French army due to their prior military training, while younger members played an active role in the national effort. The FGSPF also provided the Ministry of Agriculture with groups of young urbanites to assist with field work. In Paris, the organization organized teams of stretcher-bearers to help with the reception of wounded soldiers at the city's train stations.

The victory in 1918 came at a cost for the FGSPF, with 24,000 members killed and 60,000 wounded. Two-thirds of its 110,000 members were awarded the Croix de Guerre (War Cross).

 Basketball, Culture, and the Christian Working Youth (1919–1940) 

After welcoming and integrating the Elsaessicher Turnerbund (ETB) on May 15, 1919, the organization of Catholic gymnastics societies in Alsace, which then took the name Avant-garde du Rhin (AGR), the FGSPF celebrated victory on July 25, 1920, with a grand competition in Metz, the hometown of Paul Michaux, now French again. Over 25,000 young people from the patronages participated in this event, demonstrating their commitment and sacrifice to improve relations with public authorities. On March 20, 1921, Dr. Michaux was honored with the Legion of Honor by Marshal Foch for his outstanding and dedicated service to youth. The FGSPF was officially approved in 1922, and its associations received approvals and subsidies from the Ministry of War, with a focus on gymnastics and military preparation. The 25th anniversary of the FGSPF was celebrated on July 23, 1923, bringing together 28,000 gymnasts and musicians from 600 different associations. Despite some criticism from progressive clergy regarding ""war-like sports,"" this marked a prosperous era for the federation. It became the leading French sports federation between the decline of the USFSA and the rise of single-sport federations, particularly excelling in football and basketball. By 1928, 1,500 of its 2,500 patronages were approved, and on April 26, it was admitted to the National Sports Committee. The FGSPF played a key role in introducing major innovations during the interwar period, such as sports insurance in 1924, medical certificates in 1930 initiated by Dr. Récamier, and popular sports certificates for football and basketball athletes. Despite the passing of Paul Michaux in 1923 and his replacement by François Hébrard, the federation continued its momentum.

Sports developed, particularly basketball, in which the general secretary, Armand Thibaudeau, was particularly invested. It first structured within the French Athletics Federation (FFA) born from the breakup of the USFSA immediately after the war. The same year, the first federal championship in this discipline appeared. By 1925, for the Paris region alone, the FGSPF had 110 teams, while the FFA only counted 57. It was a patronage from Le Havre founded in 1874, the Saint Thomas Basket Le Havre, which was the first club registered by the FFBB when it gained autonomy in 1932. This was also the time of the development of associations in French Algeria, and once again basketball was at the forefront. The Spartiates d'Oran, the best club in Algeria, were crowned champions of the French Union in 1949 after beating the military team of France and the Sports Association of Villeurbanne Éveil lyonnais (ASVEL). This association, 17-time French champions between 1949 and 2009, emerged in 1948 from the rather unusual merger of a Lyon patronage, the Éveil Sportif Sainte Marie de la Guillotière de Lyon (ESSMG), with the largely secular Sports Association of Villeurbanne, affiliated with the Workers' Sports and Gymnastics Federation (FSGT).

The FGSPF acknowledged the importance of theater and cinema, which have been integral parts of the patronages' activities since the 19th century. However, to prevent competition, these areas were not directly managed by the federation but were under the purview of the Catholic Works Theatrical Association (ATOCEP) and the Leisure and Cinematographic Culture Federation (FLECC). The same approach was taken with holiday camps, which saw growth with the introduction of paid vacations in 1922 and initiatives by Marc Sangnier (1873–1950) in establishing Youth Hostels (AJ) from 1929, as well as local scout troops affiliated with the patronages. President François Hébrard maintained positive relationships with these organizations that played a significant role in the daily activities of affiliated associations. It wasn't until 1968 that the French Sports and Cultural Federation (FSCF) officially assumed responsibility for these activities, which have been part of the patronages since their inception.

Gymnastics remains the primary activity, with Gabriel Maucurier, a former international gymnast and inspector for the city of Paris, leading important training efforts. The initiative began in 1924 with the Seine-et-Oise regional union, and in 1929, the FGSPF expanded the program to Strasbourg, followed by Royan in 1930, and the Joinville Higher School in 1935 for the first federal monitors' training course. By 1936, one-third of the French team at the Berlin Olympics was from the FGSPF. The FGSPF continued its dominance at the UIOCEPN GamesFICEP's first name in Vienna in 1936 and Ljubljana in 1938, with athletes like Herman, Hérold, and the Schlidwein brothers leading the way. Sports and gymnastics are the core focus of the FGSPF, with military preparation also playing a significant role. In 1935, the FGSPF awarded 3,732 certificates under its authority.

It was a time of grand event organization, with notable gatherings such as the one in Strasbourg in 1921 (266 associations, 18,000 gymnasts, and musicians), the international competition at Champ-de-Mars in Paris on July 21 and 22, 1923, under the honorary presidency of Alexandre Millerand, President of the French Republic (600 associations, 28,000 gymnasts, and musicians), and the event in Nice in 1932 (422 associations, 19,000 gymnasts, and musicians). Large-scale movements were also organized outside of the metropolis, including events in Liège and Maribor in 1920; Brno from August 16 to 23, 1922, with special train for the 300 participants; Prague in 1929; Antwerp in 1930; Vienna in 1936; Liège in 1939; and a significant celebration in Algiers on June 14, 1930, marking the centenary of the landing of Sidi Fredj. Despite the economic crisis, 70 associations with 3,500 gymnasts and musicians from Bouches-du-Rhône, Alsace, Seine, Rhône, Aquitaine, and Maine-et-Loire participated in a grand federal competition. The Ganda from Ghent also contributed, with three special boats departing from Marseille: Lamoricière, Duke of Aumale, and Spain. Finally, on July 10 and 11, 1937, the federation brought together 900 associations, 33,000 gymnasts, and musicians in Paris for the International Exposition.

The FGSPF also supports the development of school sports by granting full autonomy to the Gymnastic and Sports Union of Free Education, which later becomes the UGSEL. In addition to gymnastics and sports, it focuses on extracurricular physical education and establishes a physical education commission in 1935. This commission develops a physical education certificate inspired by Georges Hébert, which anticipates the Popular Sports Certificate (BSP) introduced by Léo Lagrange two years later. In the same year, the first Catholic skiers' competition organized by the regional union Ain-Savoies takes place in Tarentaise. The FGSPF facilitates the transition from traditional study circles to specialized Catholic action groups such as the Young Christian Workers (YCW), Catholic Agricultural Youth (JAC), and Catholic Worker Action (ACO). To amplify its influence, it establishes a communication network and engages in promotional activities. Recognized as a cornerstone of popular education and deemed of public utility by the decree of March 31, 1932, the FGSPF receives support from the Catholic hierarchy but faces challenges during wartime.

However, due to new regulations imposed by the Sports Charter on October 4, 1940, the Women's Sports Branch (RSF) was compelled to merge with the FGSPF. The Occupation of France divided the country, leading to the Lyon regional union, led by Dr. Exaltier, becoming the focal point of the FGSPF in the free zone. Eugénie Duisit was dispatched by the federation to oversee operations. On October 24, 1942, the FGSPF had to adopt the acronym mandated by the authorities as the Union Gymnastic and Sports of Patronages of France (UGSPF). Following the Liberation, it briefly reverted to its original title before transitioning to the Sports Federation of France (FSF) in 1947.

The exact membership figures are hard to determine as official statistics are not available. The FGSPF is responsible for issuing licenses, but the process seems arbitrary. Congress reports often mention members, but the accuracy of these numbers was questioned by Robert Pringarbe. A more reliable method to gauge active members in sports is to track participants in annual competitions. In 1938, there were 120,000 participants in 287 gymnastics competitions, along with 45 regional basketball competitions, 44 football competitions, and 36 athletics competitions. Despite the federation issuing only 95,277 licenses and claiming a membership of 650,000 at the subsequent federal congress, the actual number of active participants in sports events provides a clearer picture.

 Activities of the FGSPF 

The activity of the FGSPF was primarily focused on the first half of the 20th century, particularly before 1939, as federal activity was limited during the period of the last war. With a few exceptions such as boxing, fencing, cycling, rowing, and the new mechanical sports, single-sport federations truly emerged only twenty years earlier, after 1919, and sometimes laboriously so. For instance, basketball was only recognized as a separate sport by the French Athletics Federation (FFA) in 1931. Prior to this, sports were practiced, and often it was a bit of a ""catch-all"" sport: Frantz Reichel is an illustrious example of this versatility, and Ignace Heinrich, vice-champion in the decathlon at the 1948 Olympic Games in London, stated a few years ago: ""In Alsace, athletics, even for me, started in May; before that, it was cross-country and basketball."" The results of a strictly disciplinary championship often included unexpected events. Traces of this can still be found with challenges like the basketball-athlete, the football-athlete, and the complete gymnast, the last editionAwarded the title to Yves Leton of the Jeunes Carnutes de Chartres, who died on August 29, 2013. of which took place in 1966.

It is challenging to analyze the contemporary sports model from this perspective. Despite the advancements in football, basketball, cross-country, and athletics, the essence of popular sports activity lies in large gymnastics gatherings, which is the primary focus of this federation. Originally intended to promote complete and harmonious physical development and skills, gymnastics was predominantly a multi-sport discipline. Running, jumping, throwing, climbing, lifting-carrying, and swimming events were prevalent in gymnastics championships until 1954 when they were phased out at the Moscow championships. Prior to this change, champions often excelled in weightlifting, throwing, or pole vaulting rather than traditional gymnastics apparatus like the horizontal bar. Floor acrobatics were also absent from competitive programs during this time. The Occupation period further emphasized the natural physical education method advocated by Georges Hébert, promoting the concept of the complete athlete. This approach persisted in patronages until the establishment of the FSFP and began to decline after the Rome Olympics in 1960.

 The Federal Song 

Since Francisco Amoros, collective singing has been a genuine exercise associated with gymnastics. In 1818, he published a work grouping together the best works suited for this purpose. The FGSPF also follows this tradition and has its own anthem, first published on March 27, 1932. The anthem exalts patriotic and spiritual values with lyrics by R.P. Bellouard and martial music by Gabriel Defrance, who was the president of the music and bands commission. Here is the chorus:

This work is not confidential and should be known to all members of the federation. Its execution is a part of the ranking of gymnastics competitions, and each section must perform it outdoors in a deployed order, marking time in place before proceeding to ensemble exercises, often in the early morning dew. This practice was followed until the 1960s.

 Note: FGSPF Purchases 
In 1925, the FGSPF established a commercial entity known as the Purchasing Service, which operates independently and shares the same acronym (FGSPF, meaning General Sporting Supplies for the Patronages of France). This small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) is tasked with providing sports supplies and equipment (such as clothing, balls, and gymnastics apparatus) to the headquarters services and members.

816,53039,5396667,11642,"Venetian Islands, Florida","The Venetian Islands are a chain of artificial islands in Biscayne Bay in the cities of Miami and Miami Beach, Florida.  The islands are, from west to east: Biscayne Island (Miami), San Marco Island (Miami), San Marino Island (Miami Beach), Di Lido Island (Miami Beach), Rivo Alto Island (Miami Beach), and Belle Isle (Miami Beach).  Flagler Monument Island remains an uninhabited picnic island, originally built in 1920 as a memorial to railroad pioneer Henry Flagler. The islands are connected by bridges from the Miami mainland to Miami Beach.

History
The Venetian Islands project was proposed to be much larger than what exists today. Another causeway was to be built, called ""The Drive of the Campanili.""  The causeway would connect Hibiscus Island (south of the Venetian Islands) with Di Lido Island. The road would then continue north right up the center of Biscayne Bay, with five new islands created along its path. The roadway would then veer slightly to the northeast, where it would end at Indian Creek Village. An additional four islands would be built along two east-west roads that would connect with the causeway. One of these roads was along the current route of the Julia Tuttle Causeway and the other along the current route of the 79th Street Causeway.The Miami News – November 15, 1925, p. 13

The original bridge (called the Collins Bridge) was built by farmer and developer John S. Collins with financial assistance from automotive parts and racing pioneer Carl G. Fisher. At the time it was completed, it was the longest wooden bridge in the world. The 2½ mile wooden toll bridge opened on June 12, 1913, providing a critical link to the newly established city of Miami Beach, formerly accessible only by a ferry service.

While none of these islands were built, the foundation pillings for one of them can still be seen in Central Biscayne Bay between Di Lido Island and the Julia Tuttle Causeway. The island was to be called Isola di Lolando.Florida InsideOut magazine, Competition No. 2 The demise of the island construction was due to a combination of the aftermath of the 1926 Miami Hurricane and the end of the Florida land boom of the 1920s.  The Shoreland Company went bankrupt in 1927 due to objections of ""further mutilation of the waterway"".Discussion of Biscayne Bay. nova.edu.

The original wooden causeway was replaced in 1925 by a series of arch drawbridges and renamed the Venetian Causeway. Today, the causeway is a popular stretch for people to jog, ride bikes, walk dogs and stroll.  The islands offer residents a suburb feel that is located between (and within minutes of) Miami Beach's South Beach and Miami's new Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts.

817,55817,76571513,35811,The Hangover (Suzanne Valadon),"The Hangover (Suzanne Valadon) (), also known as The Drinker (), is a late 1880s, oil-on-canvas painting by French artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.  The painting was created just before he became successful as an artist.  It depicts a drunken woman drinking alone in a club, reflecting the counterculture of Montmartre and the spectre of alcoholism among French women during the Belle Époque. The model in The Hangover is artist Suzanne Valadon, Lautrec's lover.  In the early 1880s, after falling from a circus trapeze at the age of 15 and suffering a back injury, Valadon began working as an art model in Montmartre.  She had been drawing all her life, but now she pursued a career as an artist, becoming the first woman painter admitted to the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts.

French cabaret singer and nightclub owner Aristide Bruant is thought to have influenced the development of the painting and possibly even its title. Lautrec's technique is loosely reminiscent of both the color theory of Neo-Impressionism and the technique of Lautrec's art school friend Vincent van Gogh. The work was preceded by several preparatory studies followed by a drawing in ink and chalk that was later published in Le Courrier français in 1889. Lautrec drank copious amounts of alcohol to deal with pain from his assumed underlying genetic disorder which left him disabled. Alcoholism and the syphilis he later acquired due to his habit of frequenting brothels would later contribute to his death at the young age of 36. 

The work was on permanent exhibition at Le Mirliton in the late 1880s and early 1890s.  It was first exhibited in the United States at the Armory Show in 1913. It is now held by the Fogg Museum, while the study and drawing are both held by the Musée Toulouse-Lautrec. The Hangover is one of several different works by Lautrec featuring Suzanne Valadon, including Maria Big with Child (1884) in the Von der Heydt Museum, Portrait of Suzanne Valadon (1885) in the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Portrait of the Painter Suzanne Valadon (1885) in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, and Rice Powder (1887) in the Van Gogh Museum.

Background

Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864–1901) came from an aristocratic family related to the counts of Toulouse.  Originally from Albi in southern France, his parents separated when he was young and he later moved to Paris with his mother. Lautrec was disabled, possibly due to a genetic disorder known as pycnodysostosis.Harris, James C. (August 2005) ""The Hangover (Gueule de Bois)"".  Arch Gen Psychiatry. 62 (8):824. .
Ike, John David (Spring 2017).  ""Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec: Disability and Art in Fin-de-Siècle Paris"". The Journal for the Humanities in Rehabilitation. Emory University. His birth parents were cousins, so there is speculation that his health problems came about due to their intermarriage. Lautrec's legs remained child-sized, but his torso continued to grow as an adult.  He required a cane to walk, and he did so hunched over, which invited derogatory comments about his appearance.Hewitt, Catherine (2017). Renoir's Dancer: The Secret Life of Suzanne Valadon. New York: St. Martin's Press.  . . Lautrec's father hired deaf and mute artist René Princeteau as his art tutor in his teenage years; the young Lautrec learned by copying Princeteau's work, much of which was focused on sports, hunting, and horses.Mack, Gerstle (1953)[1938]. Toulouse-Lautrec. New York: A.A. Knopf. pp. 42–63; 70–73. . Princeteau helped Lautrec get accepted into the Paris studio of Léon Bonnat at the age of 17,Courtois de Viçose, Alexandra (2022). ""Deaf gain: Toulouse-Lautrec's early training with Rene Princeteau"". In Ann Millett-Gallant and Elizabeth Howie (Ed.). Disability and Art History from Antiquity to the Twenty-First Century. Routledge. pp. 123–139. . where he trained as a painter under Bonnat and Fernand Cormon.  In the early to mid-1880s, Lautrec took up residence in Montmartre, first moving to 19 bis rue Pierre-Fontaine around 1884, then later back to a different unit in the same building in 1887. Montmartre was well known for its connection to the arts since the 12th-century reign of Louis VI, who was a notable patron. The attraction of jobs and low rents brought many people to the district.  In the late 19th century, Montmartre was inhabited by ""small tradesmen, entertainers, petty criminals, prostitutes, artists... those of Spanish, Flemish – even northern French –  descent... poor workers, mattress menders and circus performers... factory workers, seamstresses, laundresses and artisans"".Roe, Sue (2015). In Montmartre: Picasso, Matisse and Modernism in Paris 1900–1910. New York: Penguin Press. p. 15. . . 
 
Between 1884 and 1889, French laundress Carmen Gaudin modeled for Lautrec for some 15 paintings.  In the late 1880s, Lautrec began working on a series of large paintings based on the Cirque Fernando, a popular French circus in Montmartre.  His friend and colleague, Italian Impressionist painter Federico Zandomeneghi (1841–1917), recommended his own model, Marie-Clémentine Valadon,Stuckey, Charles F. (1979). Toulouse-Lautrec: Paintings Chicago: Art Institute of Chicago. pp. 124–133. . who had begun working as an art model after injuring herself as a circus trapeze artist at the age of 15.Varriano, John (2010). Wine: A Cultural History. Reaktion Books. pp. 194–203. . .  At the same time, nightclub owner Aristide Bruant opened Le Mirliton in 1885, a popular cabaret where both Valadon and Lautrec mingled.Henze, Anton. (1982). Henri De Toulouse-Lautrec: Leben Und Werk. Stuttgart: Belser. pp. 24–25, 29, 36, 86. . . Taking Zandomeneghi up on his offer, Lautrec hired Valadon to pose for one of his circus scenes which he then expanded into a larger series. Lautrec's circus works show Valadon riding side-saddle on a horse as she is about to dive through a hoop held by a clown.  They were later prominently featured at the Moulin Rouge, and were said to be so influential that it led Georges Seurat (1859–1891), Pierre Bonnard (1867–1947), and Pablo Picasso (1881–1973) to try their hand at similar circus scenes in homage to Lautrec. By that time, Valadon had already modeled for Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and  Pierre-Auguste Renoir.Chadwick, Whitney (2020)[1990]. Women, Art, and Society. 6th Ed. London: Thames and Hudson. pp. 294–295. . . Lautrec famously parodied Puvis' painting of The Sacred Grove, Beloved of the Arts and Muses.  Valadon, as it turns out, was the original model for most of the figures in that painting.Sweetman, David (1999). Toulouse-Lautrec and the Fin-De-Siécle. London: Hodder & Stoughton. pp. 163–166. . . Sociologist Janet M.C. Burns of the University of New Brunswick notes that ""it was Toulouse-Lautrec who first encouraged [Valadon's] intellectual and artistic development"".Burns, Janet (1991–1992). ""Looking as Women: The Paintings of Suzanne Valadon, Paula Modersohn-Becker and Frida Kahlo"". Atlantis 18 (1&2): 25–46.  He was the first person to buy her artwork and he also gave her the idea to change her name from Marie to ""Suzanne"".Storm, John (1958). The Valadon Drama: The Life of Suzanne Valadon. New York: Dutton. p. 20, 73–79. .

Historian Patrick Bade argues that Lautrec was an outsider as a disabled man in 19th-century, aristocratic French society, where he could ""no longer follow the traditional outdoor pastimes of his class—notably hunting"".Bade, Patrick (2000). Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. New York: Parkstone. pp. 9, 18, 87. . .
Heller, Reinhold (1997). Toulouse-Lautrec:The Soul of Montmartre. Munich: Prestel-Verlag. pp. 8–15, 20-21, 93–98.. .  Lautrec's father was said to have spurned his son over his disability, making it clear that he valued the skills of horsemanship, hunting, and soldiering in the family, things Lautrec could not do.Arnold, Matthias (1987). Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, 1864-1901: The Theatre of Life. Cologne: Taschen. . .  ""[H]is own sense of 'otherness' resulting from his physical appearance and infirmities gave him a strong empathy with those who would have been regarded by many of his contemporaries as deviants"", writes Bade. The outsider French subculture of sex work held a special appeal for Lautrec.Thomason, Richard; Cate, Philip Dennis; Chapin, Mary Weaver; Coman, Florence E. (2005). Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre. Washington, DC: National Gallery of Art, Princeton University Press. pp. viii, 68–70 . . Biographer Julia Frey believes that Lautrec was partly attracted to prostitutes as a form of rebellion against his deeply religious and controlling mother. Lautrec became obsessed with brothels (maisons closes) and his commercial work for venues like the Moulin Rouge, where prostitutes worked in secret behind closed doors, gave him easy access. He completed around 50 works featuring prostitution (including the Elles series, 1896), most of which were not widely known until after his death.Schreiber, Rachel. (2016)[2011]. Gender and Activism in a Little Magazine: The Modern Figures of the Masses. Routledge . p. 123. . . Art historian Hollis Clayson maintains that Lautrec was responsible for forging the connection between prostitution and fin-de-siècle French art.Clayson, Hollis (2003). Painted Love: Prostitution in French Art of the Impressionist Era. PDF. The Getty Research Institute. Yale University. pp. 3, 5. . .  

By the 1890s, the successful cabaret scene began to experience a downturn due to its eventual exploitation. Le Mirliton closed in 1897, bringing the Montmartre countercultural era to an end. Lautrec moved to Place Pigalle, lower Montmartre, in 1897, residing in an apartment at 15 Av.  He sank deeper into the depths of alcohol abuse in his final years, using a hollowed-out walking cane surreptitiously filled with alcohol, complete with a hidden glass, to hide his drinking from his family.Adams, Jad (2004). Hideous Absinthe: A History of the Devil in a Bottle. University of Wisconsin Press. pp. 127–128. . . In March 1899, Lautrec's family had him ""kidnapped"" while he was drunk to try and treat his alcohol problem.  When he awoke, he found himself in a locked room in the Chateau Saint-James asylum.  Several months later, he was released, but his health continued to get worse.  In 1901, he died at his family home from complications presumably related to alcoholism and tertiary syphilis at the age of 36.Conrad, Barnaby (1988). Absinthe: History in a Bottle. San Francisco: Chronicle Books. pp. 55–58. . .

Development
 
Toulouse-Lautrec's friendship with singer and nightclub owner Aristide Bruant is thought to have influenced his development of The Hangover.  Lautrec explored the then popular theme of women drinking alone in cafes in several works directly related to the lyrics of Bruant's chanson réaliste, songs that touched on the lives of poor working class women, often waitresses or prostitutes, and very often both. Waiting (c. 1887) and A la Bastille (Jeanne Wenz) (1888) are two portraits Lautrec completed based on songs by Bruant featuring the theme of women drinking alone.  While The Hangover addresses the same themes found in Lautrec's earlier paintings based on Bruant's songs, and was one of ten works that were permanently exhibited at Bruant's nightclub, many of which were based on Bruant's lyrics, it is debated if The Hangover was based on a specific song or if it was given its title by Bruant.  Art historian Gale B. Murray takes a skeptical position, writing ""although it had no direct relationship to any of Bruant's lyrics, its picture of alcoholic dissipation and despondency corresponded to the song-writer's vocabulary"".Murray, Gale Barbara. (1991). Toulouse-Lautrec: The Formative Years, 1878–1891.  Clarendon Studies in the History of Art. New York: Clarendon Press; Oxford University Press. pp. 163–165, 248, 265. . . On the other hand, Frey asserts that Bruant was likely responsible for giving the painting its title.

Lautrec may have begun working on the painting sometime before February 1888. According to John Storm, Valadon modeled for The Hangover for fun and amusement, not as a paid modeling job.  It was, Storm writes, ""an experience they shared in high spirits, a little private joke that came as an aftermath of one of Lautrec's less inhibited parties"". It is also believed that the relationship between Lautrec and Valadon was over sometime around or after February.Perruchot, Henri; Hare, Humphrey (Trans.) (1960)[1958]. Toulouse-Lautrec (La Vie de Toulouse-Lautrec). Cleveland: The World Publishing Company. p. 122, 301. . .

Van Gogh was present in Lautrec's studio when he began painting The Hangover,Lassaigne, Jacques (1953). Lautrec: Biographical and Critical Studies. Geneva: Skira. pp. 26, 35–36. . and he continued to show interest in its development.Frey, Julia (1994). Toulouse-Lautrec: A Life. New York: Viking. pp. 232–241. . . Art critic Henri Perruchot implies this was because Lautrec had borrowed elements from Van Gogh's technique of crosshatching. Previously, Lautrec had used Van Gogh's technique in his Portrait of Vincent van Gogh (1887), which depicts the artist with a glass of absinthe in a nightclub.  Van Gogh was living in Arles in the summer of 1888. He wrote a letter to his brother asking about the painting, indicating he was still curious about what Lautrec was trying to do: ""Has de Lautrec finished his picture of the woman leaning on her elbows on a little table in a café?""Gogh, Vincent van (2001)[1958]. The Complete Letters of Vincent Van Gogh. Third ed. Boston: Little Brown. p. 544. . .
 ""Art: Maria of Montmartre"". Time. May 28, 1956. Retrieved April 5, 2024. Perruchot argues that in its execution, The Hangover combines ""the aesthetic influence of Van Gogh and the moral influence of Bruant"". Art historian Jacques Lassaigne writes that ""the influence of [Van Gogh's] technique is manifest"".

Description
A woman sits alone inside a cafe at one of two round tables near a pillar, leaning on the table with her elbows.  Appearing in profile, her ear and forehead are hidden by her hair, tied back in a bun on her neck. A glass of wine, almost empty, sits in front of her, with a half-empty bottle next to it.  She appears sickly or tired and is treating her hangover with more wine.  Her white shirt identifies her as a working-class woman, likely a prostitute.

Throughout its history, the painting has been known by several titles.O'Brian, John (1988). Degas to Matisse: The Maurice Wertheim Collection. New York: Harry N. Abrams and the Fogg Art Museum. pp. 30, 81–83, 146, 154.  .

Themes

The Hangover depicts a drunken woman drinking alone in a club, reflecting the counterculture of Montmartre and the specter of alcoholism among French women during the Belle Époque in the 1880s. The theme was well known to the French public at the time, having been popularized by Emile Zola in his book L'Assommoir (1877).  Even before Zola published his novel, Toulouse-Lautrec was likely familiar with the theme in art, which Edgar Degas notably painted earlier in L'Absinthe (1875–76), followed by Édouard Manet covering the same ground with Plum Brandy (1877) the next year.

Art historian John Varriano highlights the rise of alcohol consumption during the emergence of modernism, and how its depiction changed in 19th-century French art. Haussmannization contributed to the rise of café and music culture, which brought foreigners and residents displaced by construction together to mingle, socialize, and drink. The French legislature deregulated the liquor industry in 1880, leading to what historian Matthew Ramsey describes as a ""rapid growth in bars and other outlets"".Ramsey, Matthew (1994). ""Public Health in France"". In Porter, Dorothy (Ed.). The History of Public Health and the Modern State. Netherlands: Brill. p. 81. . . Champagne production almost doubled from 1850 to 1883, while wine consumption by Parisians tripled.  ""Increased consumption"", writes Varriano, ""led to increased dysfunction"".  Culinary historian Alexandra Leaf notes that by the end of the 19th century, Paris had 27,000 cafés, the highest number of retail business establishments serving alcoholic beverages in the world.Sooke, Alastair (July 28, 2014). ""How to cook like Henri Toulouse-Lautrec"". BBC. Culture. Retrieved August 21, 2024.
Leaf, Alexandra (1995)[1966]. ""Preface"". In Toulouse-Lautrec, Henry de and Maurice Joyant. The Art of Cuisine. Holt, Rinehart and Winston. . .

In terms of the artistic milieu, Jim Drobnick of OCAD University hypothesizes a kind of ""inebriationism"" to describe the use of alcohol for creative purposes that was popularized in the wake of Romanticism.  Drobnick cites Arthur Rimbaud and Charles Baudelaire as major exponents of intoxication, which both Van Gogh and Lautrec took advantage of when it came to using absinthe in the cabarets.Drobnick, Jim (2017) ""Inebriationism"". Performance Research. 22 (6): 27–28. .  Aside from this artistic ""methodology"", there were other reasons for drinking.  The general public came to the cafés ""to wash away their unfulfilled hopes and dreams with alcohol"". Varriano notes that Lautrec may have been drawn to drinking and café culture in this way as well to help cope with his disability. John Storm writes that ""Lautrec drank constantly to anesthetize the pain in his legs and in prodigious quantities."" Valadon may have been attracted to drinking when she had to give up her dream as a trapeze artist for the Cirque Molier after she fell and injured her back at the age of 15.  In The Hangover, writes Varriano, Valadon ""stares vacantly into space... Her lack of affect is hardly unique for its time, and likenesses like this are common in the café scenes of Manet, Degas and others. This is the face of urban modernity, detached from a world which on the surface appeared so vibrant and fresh.""

Reception
 
Toulouse-Lautrec was often criticized for the way he presented his art models. Biographer June Rose accused Lautrec of portraying Valadon as a ""slattern"" in his work, which contributed to the ""tone of disparagement of Valadon the slut"" for a century, often obscuring her later achievements as a woman artist.Rose, June (1999). Suzanne Valadon: The Mistress of Montmartre. New York: St. Martin's Press. pp. 1, 85–86. . . As late as 1996, writes Rose, experts were still unfairly referring to Valadon as a prostitute, in spite of her many achievements in the world of art since her time as a model. Working-class women like Valadon were viewed as sexually available and promiscuous.Schneider, Kathryn (2022). ""'Une force ignorée': Three nineteenth-century French women artists"". (MA thesis). Texas Christian University. pp. 39–44, Retrieved April 6, 2024. Along these same lines, Kathryn Schneider of the New Orleans Museum of Art notes how Lautrec's depiction of Suzanne Valadon changed in The Hangover compared to previous paintings after their relationship soured. ""Lautrec's weakening friendship presents itself in Lautrec's painting of her"", writes Schneider, ""where he depicted her chastened and displeased, seated alone bent over a glass of wine. This portrayal differs greatly from Lautrec's 1885 portrait of Valadon entitled Madame Suzanne Valadon, artiste-peintre, where the artist represented Valadon as a confident and chic woman.""

Other artists who supported Lautrec were aligned with his aesthetics and sensibilities. The Hangover would serendipitously bring French Impressionist Edgar Degas (1834–1917) into Lautrec's orbit when it caught his attention and vocal admiration. The illustrated magazine Le Courrier français published a drawing of The Hangover in 1889.    Subsequently, Lautrec gifted the drawing to the Dihau family of musicians.  The family collected paintings and maintained their own gallery at home and were friends with Degas, although Lautrec had never made his acquaintance up to this point.  One day, Degas was visiting the Dihau home and noticed the drawing of The Hangover, featuring Valadon as the model, hanging on the wall. ""To think,"" Degas remarked, ""a young man has done this, when we have worked so hard all our lives!"" Later, Lautrec recommended Valadon to Degas as a potential mentee. Contrary to rumors, she never posed for Degas. They became friends, and Degas is said to have helped her exhibit her work in 1894 at the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, the first woman painter to do so.Sowerwine, Charles (2018)[2001]. France Since 1870: Culture, Politics and Society. 3rd Ed. London: Palgrave. p. 95. . .

Provenance
The painting is thought to have been originally held by Aristide Bruant, but the provenance is unclear. It was later acquired by Maurice Masson in Paris and sold in 1911 to New York art dealer Stephan Bourgeois, thought to be representing Illinois native and Canadian railway tycoon William Cornelius Van Horne.  In 1914, a duplicate, counterfeit art forgery was discovered at a retrospective exhibition.  The authentic work was held by Van Horne's descendants until 1946, when it was sold to art collector Maurice Wertheim for $30,000 at an auction of the family collection.  At the time, Art News reported that Wertheim's purchase of the painting was the ""outstanding item"" of the entire Van Horne collection, as it was the most expensive painting sold at the auction. Wertheim was said to prefer The Hangover to  Lautrec's Redhead in Mr. Forest's Garden (1887), Lautrec's portrait of Carmen Gaudin (now in the collection of the Norton Simon Museum). Upon his death, Wertheim bequested the work to the Fogg Museum in 1951. The painting underwent a full technical examination in 1985, including pigment analysis and an X-radiograph. The study and drawing are held by the Musée Toulouse-Lautrec.Musée Toulouse-Lautrec (1973). Musée Toulouse-Lautrec: Catalogue. Palais de la Berbie. Coopérarative du Sud-Ouest, Albi. pp. xxiii, 122–123. .

Exhibitions
Between 1886 and 1892, Aristide Bruant maintained a permanent exhibition of selected works by Toulouse-Lautrec in his nightclub, Le Mirliton.  By 1892, there were at least ten known works by Lautrec in the collection:

At least three notable exhibitions of The Hangover took place in the 20th century, and one in the 21st.  These include its appearance at the International Exhibition of Modern Art, 69th Regiment Armory, New York City, from February 17 to March 15, 1913; its exhibition at the Art Association of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, in 1933; its appearance at the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, Ontario, in 1944; and its showing in the Three Women: Early Portraits by Henri Toulouse-Lautrec exhibition at the Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, Massachusetts, from April 6 to July 21, 2002.Kianovsky, Sarah B.

821,22925,75632712,3451,Württembergische Notenbank,"The Württembergische Notenbank () was a German bank founded in 1871 and based in Stuttgart. It issued its own banknotes until 1935, when it was renamed Württembergische Bank (). In 1978, it merged with the Bank of Baden and private-sector  to form , which in turn was merged in 2005 into Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.

Overview

No fewer than seven different projects of creating a central bank for the Kingdom of Württemberg between 1848 and 1866. The decision was precipitated by the founding of the German Empire in 1871, which meant that individual German states would soon lose their right to legislate with regard to the monetary system. Württemberg decided to pre-empt this situation by creating a note-issuing bank before the entry into force of the interdiction to do so. The Württembergische Notenbank was thus authorized by legislation of July 1871, registered on , and granted a note-issuance privilege on , less than two weeks before the deadline set by imperial law.

By 1906, the Württembergische Notenbank was one of only four note-issuing banks left aside from the Reichsbank, together with the Bank of Baden, the Bayerische Notenbank, and the Saxony. In 1923, the State of Württemberg acquired a majority stake of 62 percent of the bank's equity capital. The residual note-issuing privilege was eventually abolished by Nazi legislation of , coming into force on . In the postwar period, the bank opened more branches, took over small local banks, and started to expand internationally before approving the merger creating BW-Bank on .

Life and career
Evans was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania on October 20, 1962. In 1980, he moved to Los Angeles for college. Evans attended Loyola Marymount University and graduated with a film degree in 1984. He got his start writing action-thriller films, but found his niche in the 1990s with family-oriented films that appealed to adults, children and critics alike.

Evans became one of the highest paid screenwriters during this time, selling the screenplays to both Radio Flyer and The Sandlot for over $1,000,000 each. The former was originally to be directed by Evans, but he was replaced by Richard Donner due to his inexperience. Reshoots followed after poor test screenings and the film budget jumped from $15,000,000 to $30,000,000. The original script called for more fantasy sequences involving a worm man and zombies, but these ideas were scrapped when Richard Donner replaced Evans. Radio Flyer opened to mostly mixed reviews from critics while The Sandlot received much more positive reviews and better box office results.

Success for Evans became fleeting by the late 1990s, with films like First Kid and Ed bombing with critics and at the box office. He switched to more adult-oriented humor and material with After School Special, but did not fare much better. Since then, Evans has written and directed numerous made-for-TV and direct-to-DVD films, including The Sandlot 2.

823,35655,76008658,12847,Zakład Samochodów Dostawczych,"Zakład Samochodów Dostawczych (), more commonly known as ZSD, was a Polish company located in Nysa that produced commercial vehicles. Until 1986, it was an independent company but was later incorporated into the FSO plant in Warsaw.

 History 

The origins of the plant date back to 1952, when the ""Car Body Construction Plant"" was established in Nysa. Previously, in the years 1947–1951, this plant, called the Steel Furniture Factory ""Zachód"", manufactured hospital beds, chairs, desks, wardrobes and strongboxes. After the decision to change the profile, the development and then production of special and specialized bodies adapted for installation on the chassis of FSC Lublin-51 and Star 20 trucks began. Van bodies for various purposes were built, as well as workshop bodies and traveling cinemas.

In 1953, the expansion of the plant began, which included the construction of a new assembly hall. As Poland developed, the lack of small delivery vehicles with a load capacity of up to 1,000 kg became more noticeable. Cars of this type were not manufactured anywhere in Poland or in neighbouring countries at that time. At the turn of 1956–1957, it was decided to start work on just such a vehicle. This is how the ZSD Nysa was created. In the second half of the 1980s, the factory was incorporated into Fabryka Samochodów Osobowych (FSO) from Warsaw. It launched the production of the FSO Polonez Truck model.

In 1994, ZSD ended the production of Nysa. The years 1996–2002 were the period when the South Korean concern GM Daewoo was the owner. The factory was able to develop, was privatized and produced small delivery vehicles, including the Polonez Truck Plus, and later assembled the Citroën C15 and Berlingo. The problems of the GM Daewoo concern did not go unnoticed by the Nysa plant. The plant began to have serious problems with financial liquidity. There were attempts to save the plant by renaming it Nysa Motor Sp. z o. o. and unsuccessful attempts to transform the plant into an employee-owned company. On June 3, 2002, the Commercial Court in Opole announced the bankruptcy of Nysa Motor. Trade unionists announced that they would not stop the protest. Some people in the plant went on hunger strike. Ultimately, however, the protest action was interrupted. In November 2002, thanks to orders and financing of production by Daewoo dealers, a batch of 166 copies of the Polonez Truck Plus in the Roy version with a 1.9D engine was produced from parts remaining in the manufacturer's warehouses. Production was resumed once again in March 2003  also thanks to the financing of production by sellers, which consisted in paying for the cars before the production process was resumed. This is how the last batch of 288 Truck Plus Polonez's were created.

It is encompassed within two areas of the City Information System: Jeziorki Północne (North Jeziorki) and Jeziorki Południowe (South Jeziorki), and is traditionally divided into two parts: Nowe Jeziorki (New Jeziorki), and Jeziorki Polskie (Polish Jeziorki). The neighbourhood is a residential area of low-rise single-family housing.

The village of Jeziorki was founded in the 15th century, via separation from the village of Gramnica, which no longer exists. In 1951, it was incorporated into the city of Warsaw.

 Etymology 
The name Jeziorki refers to numerous lakes and ponds located within its boundaries, and can be loosely translated from Polish as the Little Lakes.Kwiryna Handke: Dzieje Warszawy nazwami pisane. Warsaw: Warsaw History Museum, 2011, p. 307. ISBN 978-83-62189-08-3. (in Polish)

Throughout history, the name has been  recorded as: Grambnicze circa lacum (1421 rok), Grambnicze dicta Jeszyora (1424), Jezorky alias Grampnicze (1460), Jesyorki (1507), Jezyorky (1521), and Jezierkowicze (1533).

 History 
The village of Jeziorki was founded in the 15th century, via separation from the village of Gramnica, which no longer exists.Barbara Petrozolin-Skowrońska (editor): Encyklopedia Warszawy, Warsaw: Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN, 1994, p. 296, ISBN 83-01-08836-2. (in Polish) In the 16th century, it was owned by the Jeziorkowski family of the Radwan heraldic clan. In 1528, together with surrounding farmland, its estate had an area of 50 ha. In 1602, it was part of the Catholic parish based in Raszyn.""Jeziorki"": In: Tomasz Jurek (editor): Słownik historyczno-geograficzny ziem polskich w średniowieczu. Edycja elektroniczna, 2010–2019. Instytut Historii Polskiej Akademii Nauk. (in Polish)

The village was destroyed by Swedish forces during the Deluge, a conflict between the Swedish Empire and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth lasting from 1655 to 1660. In the second half of the 17th century, portion of the village, with an area of 9 ha, was bought by Warsaw canon Czyżewski, who then incorporated it into his land estate of Dawidy. In 1729, Jeziorki had 10 households.

At the beginning of the 19th century, to the village begun moving in German settlers. Since then, it was divided into two parts: Jeziorki Polskie (Polish Jeziorki), inhabited by Polish people, and Jeziorki Niemieckie (German Jeziorki), inhabited by German people, and later known as Nowe Jeziorki (New Jeziorski). In 1827, Jeziorki Niemieckie were inhabited by 110 people in 10 households.

In 1864, German settles had also founded the village of Ludwinów. It was located to the north of Jeziorki, in the area of current Ludwinowska Street.Lech Królikowski: Ursynów wczoraj, dziś, jutro. Warsaw, 2014, p. 49. (in Polish)

833,1666,75017419,11992,Indian Summer (EP)," Indian Summer is the self-titled debut EP by American emo band Indian Summer. It was released in 1993 through Repercussion Recordings. After brothers Adam and Seth Nanaa's band Sinker dissolved, they started a new band and recorded songs for their EP at Bart Thurber's recording studio. The EP is an emo and post-hardcore release, containing three songs with a rhythmic structure that alternates from quiet spoken-word vocals to a loud sound.

After the release, the band would release three more splits and appear in three compilations before breaking up. All three tracks were included in the compilations Science 1994 by Future Recordings and Giving Birth To Thunder by The Numero Group.

Background
After the disbandment of Adam Nanna and Seth Nanna's previous emo band, Sinker, the brothers decided to create a new band called Indian Summer. The brothers recruited drummer Dan Bradley, who also previously drummed for Sinker, and guitarist Marc Bianchi, a friend of Seth who was also in other bands. The band decided to followed a pattern for their songs of alternating a quiet tune with spoken-word vocals and a loud sound with aggressive vocals akin to screamo. 

The band members started to create a five-song music set featuring, ""Aren't You, Angel,"" ""mm."" ""Woolworm,"" ""Reflections on Milkweed,"" and ""Orchard."" However, due to commitment issues, Dan Bradley left Indian Summer due to the rigorous practice schedule it demanded. The band only recorded and released one song at a rehearsal of the set with Bradley, ""Orchard."" Adam panned the recording due to it being recorded on a 8-track cassette, as he believed it made it ""completely fucked."" Despite the quality of the recording, the band would keep the recording and later release the track on a split album. Eyad Kaileh, a drummer recommended by Marc Bianchi, replaced Bradley. The quartet improved the four remaining songs on the list and decided to record immediately. They decided to record at Bart Thurber's House of Faith.

Production

At the session, the band incorporated excerpts of Bessie Smith's song ""See if I'll Care"" in the background of their recordings. Adam Nanaa stumbled over the vinyl in a junkyard. He said that he added the excerpts because it would ""emulate the nights in Oakland we spent fucked up"" and ""passed out with the needle dragging the end of the Slint LP."" Additionally, the band included intentional vinyl noise in the EP.

During the recording of the EPs, all the songs were first takes at the studio. The recording session was considered chaotic according to Seth Nanaa, who said how they were acting like it was a concert. The group was surprised to know how the recording came out, describing it as ""crisp and clean"" despite the out-of-control performance and cheap instruments that were used. The signature song from that studio recording, ""Woolworm,"" is about coming from a dysfunctional family. It alludes to Adam and Seth's confrontation with their father's departure before they were born.

They selected three songs, ""Woolworm,"" ""Aren't You, Angel,"" and ""mm"" to be distributed in their debut EP. The remaining song, ""Reflections on Milkweed,"" was released on a compilation titled ""Food Not Bombs Benefit"" on *inchworm. records.

Release
For financial and aesthetic reasons, the EP by the band was designed with a minimalist approach. To reduce costs, The band distributed and manufactured the material by themselves under the label Repercussion with the band's apartment serving as a base for assembling the 7-inch record. The album cover only contains a pitchfork and the band's name on the root beer-colored front cover and an image of the boy looking onto a field on the back cover along with snippets of lyrics and gibberish. Adam Nanaa said that they wanted the aesthetic to be minimalistic like other punk bands yet unique. The cover for the pitchfork was a stick that was resting in the tom hole of a bass drum.
 

The band intentionally released their album without a track listing initially. On tour setlists they usually placed hieroglyphs of many items such as guns, planes, angels, and stars to identify the songs. This intention was an artistic approach from the band because their live performances often diverged from the release of the EP and sounded unalike. Adam Nanna said that they let their live performances transcended from one part of the set to another and how by the end of the performance, it was just one long song. For instance, the track ""Woolworm"" was often referred to by fans as ""Sleeping"" or ""Angry Son"" by fans before it was officially named. In a discography reissued by The Numero Group, names for the track were released.

Reception and legacy

The release did not see much attention from critics when it was originally released but was seen positively in local music communities, establishing themselves in the emo scene. Mark Pearsall's label, Slave Cut, invited the band to contribute a track to the emo compilation ""Ghost Dance"" which included early recordings of influential emo bands Cap'n Jazz and Braid. Over time, the EP was pressed approximately 3,000 times. The track ""Woolworm"" had moderate airplay a year after its release at Stanford University's radio station KZSU to promote their performance on May 25, 1994, for KZSU's Wednesday Night Live. 

Despite the obscurity of the release at the time, the EP's track, especially ""Woolworm,"" has generally been seen positively after it saw more recognition when it was released in their discography compilations ""Science 1994"" and ""Giving Birth to Thunder"". Pitchfork, in their review of Giving Birth to Thunder, called the excerpts of Bessie Smith's voice ""the binding agent"" of the EP and how ""their defining moments are like a flash flood."" Rolling Stone named the compilation Science 1994 as one of the greatest emo albums, saying the band was known 
""for its striking contrasts,"" noting how that ""every minute of calm reaps a subsequent avalanche of havoc."" It also noted how Smith's excerpts underpinned ""the cathartic swing and crash"" of Woolworm. Vulture named ""Woolworm"" as the 19th greatest emo song of all time.

834,36648,76037060,4097,Honor board,"Honor Board, Board of Honor (Russian: Доска почета) in Russia and in Soviet Union is a special board; a stand with the names and photographs (later) of persons who graduated from educational institutions with honors, honorary military personnel, scientists, best employess, and so on.

The honor board was usually a wide shield covered with red cloth, and was located at the entrance or in the lobby of a building owned by the organization.

 History 
The history of honor boards can be traced back centuries. Already in the 14th century, after the liberation of China from the Mongol yoke, the founder of the new Ming dynasty, Emperor Hongwu, ordered the construction of two pavilions in each village of the empire, one of which would display the good deeds of the residents, and the other would contain a list of offenses committed by the villagers. In the same pavilions, village elders dealt with civil cases and tried violators.

In the Russian Empire, in military educational institutions, marble plaques were used as measures to encourage and “excite competition and striving for military valor in students,” it was ordered to have: in the recreational halls of all institutions - gray marble plaques, with the names of the most outstanding pupils of each graduation, and in the churches of the institutions there are black marble plaques to place the names of all former pupils who “fell in the name of honor or died from wounds received in battle, in whatever officer rank they suffered the glorious death of a warrior.”

During the Chinese Civil War, red and black boards became widespread in the Chinese Red Army and the “liberated areas” already in the 1930s.

In the first years of Soviet power, the Honor Board was called the red board, while as its opposite there was a black board (board of shame; see also Blacklisting (Soviet policy)), on which drunkards, truants and slackers were listed. The honor board was provided for by the “Internal Labor Regulations”, which managed the labor regulations in Soviet institutions, enterprises and organizations. In addition, there were city, district, regional, regional and republican honor boards.

With the collapse of the USSR and the change in the political and economic system in the early 1990s, the use of honor boards remained in Russia, in the Russian Armed Forces.

838,26049,75716498,14921,Jindřich Rajchl,"Jindřich Rajchl (born 27 September 1976) is a Czech political activist, lawyer and former football ambassador. He gained a public profile as a leader of demonstrations against measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic in the Czech Republic, and subsequently also against the government of Petr Fiala. He is widely considered to be a participant in the spread of misinformation in the Czech Republic.

Early life and career
Rajchl graduated from the Faculty of Law of Charles University in Prague. He was brought into football by František Chvalovský, executive director of the Czech club FK Chmel Blšany (2002-2005). Rajchl was associated with FK Dukla Prague, then became vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR).

In 2011, Rajchl attempted unsuccessfully to become chairman of FAČR, failing to gain the support of , according to news server . He was also linked to another football ambassador, Ivan Hašek.

Between 2011 and 2012, Rajchl was a member of the board of directors of SAZKA,
 following the company's bankruptcy and the sale of its betting business.

Rajchl worked as a director of the gambling company Bwin for the Czech Republic and Slovakia. However, the company closed the office in the former country during his tenure. He also operates two restaurants in Prague.

Political career
As an activist, Rajchl spoke at multiple demonstrations against measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic in the Czech Republic and Russo–Ukrainian war.

Rajchl was a member of the Tricolour Citizens' Movement and ran to become a candidate in the 2018 Czech presidential elections, but suspended his bid before the election. At the party assembly in January 2022, he withdrew his candidacy to become party chair, with Zuzana Majerová re-elected instead.

Rajchl has been a key figure in demonstrations against the Cabinet of Petr Fiala. He is widely considered to be a participant in the spread of misinformation in the Czech Republic, including the COVID-19 pandemic.

In June 2022, Rajchl founded a new party, Law, Respect, Expertise (PRO), serving as its founding chair. The party is perceived by some critics as having a pro-Kremlin orientation. The PRO-supported candidate in the 2022 Czech Senate election was also endorsed by outgoing senator , an open supporter of Vladimir Putin.

On 3 September 2022, Rajchl took part in an anti-government demonstration attended by 70,000 people. Several politicians, including Prime Minister Petr Fiala, characterised the protest as a ""pro-Russian initiative"". On 11 March 2023, Rajchl called a demonstration, ""Czech Republic against poverty"", during which protesters attempted to remove the Ukrainian flag flying outside the National Museum, where supporters of Ukraine had gathered. According to journalist Martin Bartkovský, a long-time analyst of anti-government demonstrations, this demonstrated the anti-Ukrainian focus of the event.

In June 2023, Seznam Zprávy included Rajchl on a list of people who make money by spreading fear and manipulation. He repeatedly predicted that a litre of fuel would cost up to CZK 150. Rajchl also reported the end of the company Kofola, which was in fact doing well. He later discussed this issue with Czech citizens, but Seznam Zprávy reported that the number of participants in these discussions had been overstated.

Rajchl also joined a protest by farmers in February 2024. Some farmers distanced themselves from Rajchl, and ended the protest early due to his participation. During the protest, it was reported that Rajchl physically threatened a young man who expressed disagreement with him.

Rajchl was announced as the lead candidate for the PRO list in the 2024 European Parliament elections.",2024-12-27,"['1976 births' 'Living people' 'Politicians from Hradec Králové'

844,21548,75600736,7182,Sephardic Jews in Romania,"Sephardic Jews have played an important historical role in Romania, although their numbers in the country have dwindled to a few hundred, with most living in the capital, Bucharest. Antisemitic pogroms and economic strife lead to mass emigration out of the country in the 20th century.

 History 

 Origins 
Many Sephardic Jews began settling in Wallachia in the 16th century, then under Ottoman rule, although there is evidence they began settling in Romania as early as 1496 following the Spanish Inquisition and Alhambra Decree. They arrived through the Ottoman Empire, which was more welcoming towards Jewish immigration than other countries in Europe at the time.

 Communities 

In 1730, following advice of Jews Daniel de Fonseca and Celebi Mentz Bali, the then-ruler of Wallachia, Nicolae Mavrocordat, formally allowed Sephardic Jews to organize themselves into communities. Since then, according to historian Iuliu Barasch, many Sephardim from the Ottoman Empire began settling in Romania. However, it was not until 1819 that the first synagogue was built in the capital, Cahal Grande, with reforms by Rabbis Eliezer Papo and Damascus Eliezer.

Since the establishment of said communities, the Sephardic community in Romania thrived, despite antisemetic measures taken by government officials Ion C. Brătianu and Dimitrie A. Sturdza. In 1934, there were large Sephardic communities in Bucharest, Craiova, Ploiești, Turnu Severin, Timișoara, Corabia, Calafat, Brăila, Galați, Tulcea, Constanța and Giurgiu.

From 1921 to 1930, there was no head rabbi for the Jews in the country. 1931 saw Sabetay Djaen become the chief Sephardic rabbi for the country. He stayed until the end of the 2nd World War; then he returned to Argentina. 

Sephardic Jews' situation worsened in 1937, along with the rest of the Jews in Romania, suffering from antisemetic laws established by Octavian Goga's government, as well as Miron Cristea's, but especially by the National Legionary State. During the Legionary Rebellion at the Bucharest pogrom, the Cahal Grande Synagogue was burned to the ground.

 Current time 
Following the establishment of the communist regime, Romanian Sephardic Jews emigrated en masse to Israel. Currently, there are several hundred Sephardic Jews left in Romania, the majority in Bucharest. They no longer have a synagogue exclusive to their community. There is a minute amount of Sephardic Jews who emigrated to Bucharest in modern times, mostly from Israel.

All Fellows receive a cartoon upon completion of their Fellowship.

Governance
The IPT Board of Trustees includes six MPs and four members of the House of Lords. It also includes representatives from business, legal and parliamentary clerks. The current chair of the trustees is Liz Twist and the Presidents are the Speaker of the House of Commons, The Rt Hon Sir Lindsay Hoyle MP and the Speaker of the House of Lords, The Lord McFall of Alcluith.

The Chief Executive is Nick Maher who began at the IPT in July 2011 having previously served in the Ministry of Defence on a team constructing a 'New Employment Model' for the Armed Forces. His predecessor was Sally Muggeridge, who served as Chief Executive for seven years.

The IPT employs ten members of staff, all based in Whitehall, London. Nick's dog, Lucy, also serves an important unpaid role as Chief Morale Booster.

 History 
The IPT was founded in 1977 by the CEOs of 10 major British companies who sought to create dialogue between business and Parliament. It became a registered charity in 1983. The IPT has organised more than 600 Fellowship programmes since it was founded.

When the IPT was set up, just 15% of MPs had any direct business experience.Brook, Rosemary (1994). ""The Industry and Parliament Trust: Contributing to better government and greater prosperity of UK plc"". Journal of Communication Management. 4(1), 57-63. Today that figure much higher, though needless to say there is still a substantial proportion of MPs without a comprehensive understanding of business.

In October 2009 the IPT commissioned a research project into the business experience of the Prospective Parliamentary Candidates (PPCs) who stood in the 2010 General Election. The research found that of the PPCs in winnable seats, less than half (48%) had any form of business management or financial services experience.

History
Ayacucho sent deputies to the Sicuani Assembly of March 1836, where the Constitution of the Southern Peruvian State was drafted under the guidance of the then rebel politician  in the midst of the Peruvian civil war since 1835. The constitution proclaimed the state of South Peru and the alliance with the Bolivian occupation forces for the creation of the Peru-Bolivian Confederation.

With Piérola's victory, the Fundamental Law of 1837 in Tacna, with approval of the self-proclaimed supreme protector Andrés de Santa Cruz, recognized Ayacucho as a founding department of the Confederation. Ayacucho also had deputies in Congress as part of the South Peruvian parliamentary group.

Ayacucho was subject to the General Government, its governor was appointed by the president of the State, and this in turn was appointed by the supreme protector on duty. The governor was obliged to elect representatives of his department to participate in the assemblies of Sicuani, which were ordered by the president of the South Peruvian State.",2024-11-09,"['Subdivisions of the Peru–Bolivian Confederation'

847,24604,5317722,8875,Sydney Taylor Book Award,"The Sydney Taylor Book Award recognizes the best in Jewish children's literature. Medals are awarded annually for outstanding books that authentically portray the Jewish experience. The award was established in 1968 by the Association of Jewish Libraries. It is named in memory of Sydney Taylor, author of the classic All-of-a-Kind Family series. Taylor's were some of the first children's books with Jewish characters that were of literary interest to readers of all backgrounds.

 History 
The award was first established by the Association of Jewish Libraries in 1968. It was the first of the identity-based awards as a result of Nancy Larrick's 1965 piece The All-White World of Children's Books, establishing new precedent wherein literary excellence is paired with authentic and well-crafted representation of a particular identity, culture, and experience.  Originally, it was known as the Shirley Kravitz Children's Book Award and was later renamed in honor of Sydney Taylor in 1978. The award initially recognized books for older children, but in 1981, the award committee started to recognize books for younger readers and in 2007, began to recognize young adult literature. In 1988, Honor Award Winners were added and these books receive a silver seal.

 About 
Awards are presented in three categories: Younger Readers, Older Readers and Teen Readers. In each category, a single gold medalist is named annually. Each year there may also be several silver medalists named in each category. A list of ten to twenty Notable Children's Books of Jewish Content is also named in each category, but these titles do not receive medals.

The award committee is made up of volunteers from the Association of Jewish Libraries. Books are evaluated based on certain criteria one of which is literary merit. Books must also be appropriate to the age level, rooted in ""authentic and accurate detail"" and have a positive and/or authentic Jewish religious or cultural content. Books nominated are newly published books for the year. Books can be picture books, non-fiction, fiction and poetry.

Criteria
 The book has literary merit.
 The book has positive and authentic Jewish religious or cultural content.
 The book is appropriate for the intended grade level in style, vocabulary, format, and illustration.
 Whether fiction or nonfiction, the book is solidly rooted in authentic and accurate detail through scholarship and research by the author.
 Particular attention will be paid to titles that demonstrate the broad diversity of the Jewish experience, including diversity of time period and country of origin.
 Textbooks, liturgy, and reprints are not eligible. Significantly revised editions and re-illustrated editions are eligible.
 Books must be commercially available for purchase in order to be eligible.
 Self-published books are not eligible. The author and illustrator must not have paid any money to the publisher. The book must be edited by a professional editor at no cost to the author/illustrator. The publisher must publish books by multiple authors.
 Books must be published in English (whether originally in English or in translation)
 If the same book is published in English in multiple countries, the first version submitted will be considered for the award. Other versions then become ineligible.

 Themes 
Most Sydney Taylor Book Award winning titles are universal in theme while Judaic in specific content, highlighting the rich diversity of Jewish lives and experiences, traditions, and values to Jewish and non-Jewish readers alike.

 Body-of-Work Award 
The body-of-work award is given ""to recognize an author or entity who has made a substantial contribution over time to the genre of Jewish children's literature."" Beginning in 2018, the award became biennial instead of periodic.

 Manuscript Award 
The Sydney Taylor Manuscript Award for children's books was first awarded in 1985. The winner receives $1,000.

848,28177,75765513,4564,Dr. Cyclops' Dream,"Dr. Cyclops' Dream is the second album by the Herbie Nichols Project, an American jazz ensemble dedicated to performing the music of composer and pianist Herbie Nichols. It was recorded during February 1999 at Tedesco Studio in Paramus, New Jersey, and was released later that year by the Soul Note label. Led by pianist Frank Kimbrough and double bassist Ben Allison, the group also features saxophonists Ted Nash and Michael Blake, trumpeter Ron Horton, and drummer Tim Horner.

Reception

In a review for AllMusic, Ken Dryden wrote: ""the date includes a wealth of Nichols' imaginative yet infrequently heard songs, plus a number of compositions recorded for the first time... Fans of the music of Herbie Nichols will be astounded by this rewarding CD.""

The authors of The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings called the music ""pretty substantial further evidence for Nichols's overlooked genius,"" and commented: ""The use of blues and non-blues intervals is utterly distinctive and these players know exactly what they're dealing with.""

Glenn Astarita of All About Jazz stated that the musicians ""capture the proverbial spirit while putting an indelible stamp to the music of a man who during his tenure in jazz was often overshadowed by others, which to this day remains somewhat of a mysterious or forlorn notion... [they] take the music of Herbie Nichols into the twenty-first century as his music lives on through the eyes and ears of this estimable bunch! Highly recommended!!""

850,15881,5294670,18022,Silvertip shark,"The silvertip shark (Carcharhinus albimarginatus) is a large species of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae, with a fragmented distribution throughout the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans. It is often encountered around offshore islands and coral reefs, and has been known to dive to a depth of . The silvertip shark resembles a larger and bulkier grey reef shark (C. amblyrhynchos), but can be easily identified by the prominent white margins on its fins. It attains a maximum length of .

An aggressive, powerful apex predator, the silvertip shark feeds on a wide variety of bony fishes, as well as eagle rays, smaller sharks, and cephalopods. This species dominates other requiem sharks of equal size when competing for food, and larger individuals are often heavily scarred from conflicts with others of its species. As with other members of its family, the silvertip shark is viviparous, with females giving birth to one to 11 pups in the summer. Silvertip sharks are regarded as potentially dangerous to humans, as they often approach divers quite closely. This slow-reproducing species is taken by commercial fisheries for its meat, fins, skin, cartilage, and jaws and teeth, which has apparently led to local population declines or extirpations.

Taxonomy and phylogeny
The silvertip shark was originally described as Carcharias albimarginatus by German naturalist Eduard Rüppell, in the 1837 Fische des Rothen Meeres (Fishes of the Red Sea). The name was later changed to the currently valid Carcharhinus albimarginatus. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin albi meaning ""white"", and marginatus meaning ""to enclose with a border"",Bester, Cathleen. Biological Profiles: Silvertip Shark, Florida Museum of Natural History Ichthyology Department. Retrieved on February 12, 2009. in reference to the distinct white fin margins.Bray, Dianne J. (2011) Silvertip Shark, Carcharhinus albimarginatus  (Rüppell 1837) , in Fishes of Australia In 1960, a -long immature male caught off Ras Muhammad in the Red Sea was designated as the type specimen. Based on similarities in morphology, tooth shape, and vertebral characters, Garrick (1982) proposed the grey reef shark as the closest relative of the silvertip shark.Garrick, J.A.F. (1982). Sharks of the genus Carcharhinus. NOAA Technical Report, NMFS CIRC-445. This interpretation was corroborated by Lavery (1992), based on allozyme data.

Distribution and habitat

The silvertip shark is widely but not continuously distributed in the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans. In the western Indian Ocean, this species occurs from the Red Sea to South Africa, including Madagascar, the Seychelles, the Aldabra Group, Mauritius and the Chagos Archipelago. In the western Pacific, it is known from off southern Japan to northern Australia, including Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, Guam, Palau, the Solomon Islands, the Marshall Islands, the Phoenix Islands and Tahiti. In the eastern Pacific, it occurs from southern Baja California to Colombia, including the Cocos, Galapagos, and Revillagigedo Islands. Its presence in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea is unconfirmed.

Silvertip sharks are found over continental and insular shelves at a depth of , occupying all levels of the water column. They are most common around isolated islands, coral banks, and reef drop-offs. Juveniles frequent coastal shallows or lagoons, while adults occur in deeper water, with little overlap between the two age groups.

Description
The silvertip shark is a robust and streamlined species with a moderately long, broad snout and large, round eyes. The five pairs of gill slits are short. It has 12–14 tooth rows on each side of both jaws, with one or two small teeth at the symphysis (middle of the jaws). The upper teeth are broad with oblique triangular cusps and coarse serrations near the base; the lower teeth have erect cusps with fine serrations. The first dorsal fin is large and triangular, originating above or slightly forward of the free pectoral fin tips. A ridge occurs between the first and second dorsal fins. The pectoral fins are proportionately longer than in most requiem sharks and falcate (sickle-like) in shape, with pointed tips.

The coloration is blue-gray above with a bronze sheen, and white below. A subtle white band runs along the sides, with distinctive white tips and borders on all fins. Silvertip sharks can grow up to  long, but typically measure  in length. The maximum reported weight is . Females are larger than males.

Biology and ecology

Though silvertip sharks are quite mobile, they exhibit fidelity to certain areas, with reports of territorial behavior. They are usually encountered alone or in pairs. Small groups of adult females have been seen in deep water. Individual silvertip sharks behave very aggressively towards one another, and many are heavily scarred. They are also reported to dominate Galapagos sharks (C. galapagensis) and blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) of equal size when competing for food. This shark sometimes forms mixed-species aggregations with grey reef sharks. Rainbow runners (Elagatis bipinnulata) have been observed rubbing against silvertip sharks, using the sharks' rough skin to scrape off parasites. They sometimes follow marine mammals such as bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) in open water, and are themselves followed by pilot fish (Naucrates ductor).

Like the grey reef shark, the silvertip shark sometimes perform a stereotypical threat display if pursued by divers, warning that it is prepared to attack. The display begins with the shark accelerating away to a distance of , before turning and charging towards the perceived threat. At a distance of two body lengths, the shark brakes, turns broadside, drops its pectoral fins, gapes its jaws, lowers the posterior two-thirds of its body, and ""shivers"". The last two elements of this display are unique to this species; the ""shivering"" may serve to emphasize its white fin markings. If the diver persists, the shark may rapidly close in and slash with its upper teeth.Martin, R.A. Agonistic Display in Grey Reef Shark. ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research. Retrieved on February 12, 2009.

Feeding
The diet of the silvertip shark consists primarily of bony fishes, such as grouper, mackerel, tuna, escolars, lanternfish, flyingfish, wrasses, and soles. Eagle rays, smaller sharks, and octopus are occasionally taken. Larger sharks tend to be more sluggish and take more benthic prey. The differently shaped dentition in their upper and lower jaws allows them to tackle large prey, gripping and sawing off chunks of flesh with violent twists and turns. Silvertip sharks have been observed swimming around the periphery of groups of feeding sharks of other species, occasionally dashing in to steal food. This species often approaches ships, as they are attracted to certain artificial, low-frequency sounds.

Life history
Like other requiem sharks, the silvertip shark is viviparous; once the embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the depleted yolk sac develops into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. In the Southern Hemisphere, mating and parturition both occur in summer. Courtship involves the male biting the female to hold her for copulation; one female observed had the tip of her first dorsal fin bitten off from such activity.Murch, A. Silvertip Shark. Elasmodiver.com. Retrieved on February 12, 2009. Females bear litters of one to 11 (usually five or six) young after a gestation period of about one year, on a biennial cycle. The newborns have been reported to measure  and  long by different authors, and are found in shallower water than adults. The growth rate is highly variable in the wild: Kato and Hernandez (1967) reported juvenile silvertip sharks grow an average of , or 5.3% of their body length, per year, with some individuals growing as much as , 30.1% of their body length) per year and others showing negative ""growth"". Males have been reported to be sexually mature at  or  long, and females at  long.

Human interactions
Inquisitive and bold, especially in the presence of food, the silvertip shark is regarded as potentially dangerous to humans. Often, several sharks will rush up from deep water to inspect divers when they first enter the water, which can be a very intimidating experience, as they may approach quite close. This species has also been known to circle or pursue divers. In one experiment involving bait, a large silvertip shark tore the leg off a dummy dressed in SCUBA gear, demonstrating that this species is capable of inflicting lethal injuries. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File listed four provoked attacks attributable to this species, none of them fatal.ISAF Statistics on Attacking Species of Shark. International Shark Attack File, Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida. Retrieved on May 9, 2009.

The silvertip shark is caught by commercial and artisan fisheries across its range using longlines, gillnets, and trawls, both intentionally and as bycatch. The fins are highly valued for shark fin soup and are sold on the export market, along with the skin and cartilage. The meat is marketed locally, fresh or dried and salted, as are the jaws and teeth. Silvertip sharks are known to be taken by fisheries in Indonesia, Myanmar, and the Philippines, as well as by various Indian Ocean nations with coral reef fisheries; it is also an increasingly important catch of pelagic fisheries, where it is often finned at sea. This species is susceptible to overfishing, due to its slow reproductive rate and tendency to stay in a certain area. It is believed to have been extirpated by Indonesian artisan fishers at Scott Reef off northern Australia, and is likely becoming rare in many other parts of its range. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the silvertip shark as vulnerable.",2024-04-25,"['Carcharhinus' 'Pantropical fish' 'Fish described in 1837'

851,18424,75509578,22702,Attack on Looking Glass camp,"The Attack on Looking Glass Camp was a military attack carried out on July 1, 1877, as part of the Nez Perce War by Captain Stephen G. Whipple of the United States Army on the village of the Native American chief Looking Glass, located near the Clearwater River, near the present-day town of Kooskia. Glass had refused to join the other Nez Perce factions hostile to the Americans, so General Oliver Otis Howard, relying on reports that Glass posed a threat, gave the order to arrest him and his group.

When the Americans arrived, Looking Glass told them they were living in peace and asked them to leave, but a shot fired by one of the civilian volunteers accompanying the soldiers precipitated the confrontation. Surprised by the attack, the Amerindians fled their village and took refuge in the surrounding hills. The soldiers then ransacked the camp, capturing nearly 700 horses and taking them back to Mount Idaho.

Although Looking Glass's camp was destroyed, the mission was a failure for the Americans, since Whipple was unable to capture the group of Native Americans. Moreover, Looking Glass, furious at the way he had been treated by the Americans, chose to join the other groups of hostile Nez-Percés, complicating the American army's task.

 Context 
In 1855, the Nez Perce signed a treaty with the United States that established the boundaries of a reservation encompassing much of their traditional lands. In 1863, however, following the discovery of gold within the reservation, the U.S. government imposed a new treaty on the Nez Perce, reducing the size of the reservation by almost 90%. Several groups, including Looking Glass, refused to sign the ""Treaty of Flight"" and continued to live outside the reservation until the spring of 1877. In May 1877, after several incidents between settlers and the Nez-Percés, General Oliver Otis Howard, head of the Columbia Department, gave the rebels 30 days to return to the reservation.
On June 14, 1877, as the various groups of Nez Perces gathered near Tolo Lake before finally rejoining the reservation, several young Nez Perces belonging to White Bird's group set out along the Salmon River to avenge the death of a relative killed by whites a few years earlier. Back at camp, they announced that they had killed four men and wounded another. Over the next two days, some sixteen Nez Perces, carried away by the fury of war, launched new raids on the surrounding villages, killing 18 whites and severely wounding 6 others.

Knowing that the army would respond to these attacks, most of the Amerindians prepared to leave. The Looking Glass group returned to their lands within the boundaries of the reservation, near the Clearwater, hoping to avoid any confrontation with the soldiers. The groups of Chief Joseph, Toohoolhoolzote and White Bird gathered not far from the mouth of Cottonwood Creek, then planned to settle near Looking Glass's camp. Furious with White Bird for not having been able to prevent the young men of his group from committing these attacks, Looking Glass opposed their coming and addressed these words to them:.

Chief Joseph, Toohoolhoolzote and White Bird then set off for White Bird Canyon, some forty kilometers to the south.

When General Howard received news of these incidents on June 15 at Fort Lapwai, he sent two companies of cavalry under the command of Captain David Perry to assist the inhabitants of Grangeville and Mount Idaho, some 80 km from Lapwai. While there, Perry was persuaded by the people of Grangeville to pursue the Indians before they crossed the Salmon River. At dawn on June 17, American troops entered White Bird Canyon, while the Nez Perce stood ready to confront them. The ensuing battle was a heavy defeat for the American army; Perry lost 34 of his men, while the Nez Perce suffered no casualties.

Having learned of the scale of the defeat, General Howard mobilized troops and took charge of the campaign. Certain that the Americans would be back in force, the Amerindians preferred to retreat to the other side of the Salmon River, even if it meant re-crossing at another point if the soldiers decided to pursue them. On June 29, just as Howard was about to cross, he received word that Looking Glass and his party posed a threat and might join the conflict. Volunteers from Mount Idaho reported that Nez Perces from Looking Glass's group had looted two properties near the Clearwater and set fire to one of them, asserts that the looting was committed by whites, and suggests that the reports were formulated to enable volunteers to attack the Looking Glass group. and reports suggested that at least twenty of them had joined the hostile Native Americans, when in fact only a few had actually participated in the battle of White Bird Canyon. Other rumors claimed that Looking Glass and his warriors were preparing to attack the surrounding villages. Until then, Howard had always been skeptical that Looking Glass could play a role in the conflict, and was satisfied that he had chosen to stay on his land, but this latest information changed his mind and he ordered Captain Stephen Girard Whipple to ""arrest Indian Chief Looking Glass, and all other Indians who may be encamped with or near him, between the arms of the Clearwater, and imprison them at Mount Idaho, turning them over to the volunteer organization of that place for safe keeping"".

 Forces involved 

 United States Army 
The soldiers sent by General Howard formed Companies E and L of the 1st Cavalry Regiment, totaling 67 men, plus twenty civilian volunteers in Mount Idaho were led by Darius B. Randall. Company L was commanded by Captain Stephen G. Whipple, with Edwin H. Shelton as first lieutenant and Sevier M. Rains as second lieutenant. Company E was led by Captain William H. Winters, with Albert G. Forse as first lieutenant and William H. Miller as second lieutenant. The troops initially carried two Gatling guns, but these were left at Mount Idaho before reaching the Native American camp.

 Nez Perces 

The Looking Glass camp was situated on the banks of Clear Creek, not far from its confluence with the Central Branch of the Clearwater, near the present-day town of Kooskia and some thirty kilometers northeast of Mount Idaho. It was home to a dozen tipis and, on the day of the attack, probably fewer than twenty warriors, as well as around 120 women, children and elderly people. Most of the inhabitants were followers of the Waashat Religion, and as July 1 was a Sunday, some of them went to Kamiah to take part in a religious ceremony.

The Amerindians called this place Kamnaka, where they grew potatoes, corn, squash and melons, and some of them raised dairy cows.

 Prelude 
The two American cavalry companies left the Salmon River at 9 p.m. on June 29, heading for Mount Idaho, which they reached at dawn on June 30. There, Whipple left his two Gatling guns and a few men to maneuver them, and after giving the rest of the troops several hours to rest, he set off again in the late afternoon, accompanied by twenty civilian volunteers led by Darius B. Randall. Whipple planned to ride at night, hoping to arrive at the Native camp before dawn to take its occupants by surprise,This was a tactic regularly used by the American army against Native Americans at the time, particularly when small encampments were involved . but due to the rugged nature of the terrain and a miscalculation (the camp was fifteen kilometers further away than planned), they didn't arrive until 7 a.m. on the morning of July 1, well after sunrise. The American troops dismounted and positioned themselves on the crest of a hill, some 400 m west of the Amerindian village from which they were separated by Clear Creek.

Alerted by the arrival of the soldiers, Looking Glass, who was having breakfast in his tepee with several of his men, sent Peopeo Tholekt to tell them that they were living here in peace, and asked them to leave them alone. The young warrior mounted his horse, crossed Clear Creek and climbed the hill where the Americans were stationed. One of the volunteers welcomed him in nez perce, and Peopeo Tholekt delivered Looking Glass' message. As he talked to the interpreter, other – apparently drunk – volunteers approached and one of them asked him in English: ""You Looking Glass?"", poking him in the ribs with the barrel of his rifle. After the interpreter had convinced him that it wasn't Looking Glass, he asked Peopeo Tholekt to inform his boss so that he could come and negotiate in person.

Having seen how the Americans had treated Peopeo Tholekt, and fearing that they might kill their leader, the Nez Perces advised Looking Glass not to go. He asked Peopeo Tholekt, and Kalowet who spoke a little English, to return to the American troops and ask them once again to leave. After planting a flagpole between the Looking Glass tepee and Clear Creek, on which a white flag was hung as a white flag, the two Amerindians went back to the Americans and repeated their message of peace. Again, the same volunteer threatened to kill Peopeo Tholekt, certain that he was Looking Glass, but the interpreter pointed out that he was too young to be Looking Glass and made him lower his weapon. This time, one of the officers,Later identified as Lieutenant Sevier M. Rains (). accompanied by two or three men and the interpreter, returned to the camp with Peopeo Tholekt and Kalowet and asked to see Looking Glass. As they arrived at the white flag, someone – probably one of the volunteers – fired a shot in the direction of the camp and wounded an Amerindian in the hip, putting an end to all attempts at negotiation.

 Attack 

After the first shot, the Americans accompanying the Amerindians to the camp turned their horses around and hurried back to the rest of the troops. A general fusillade broke out in the camp, causing panic among its occupants. Despite the late hour, the attack took the Amerindians by surprise, and very few attempted to fight back. In small groups, they fled to the north and east of the village, seeking cover from the soldiers in the bushes. Soon, however, the firing ceased and the American soldiers came down the hill in tirailleur formation, across Clear Creek and into the deserted camp. The Nez-Percés had taken refuge upstream from Clearwater and on a hill to the east of the village, out of range of American fire.

At the same time, Lieutenants Forse and Shelton, accompanied by some 20 men, captured the Nez Percés' herd of horses. The Americans then ransacked the Amerindians' camp, searching their tipis for the few valuables and destroying the rest of their possessions. The soldiers then attempted to set fire to the tipis, but only two actually caught fire. The Americans finally returned to Mount Idaho, taking with them more than 600 horses belonging to the Nez-Percés.What happened to the horses is uncertain.  suggests that they escaped shortly afterwards.

 Results and consequences 

The attack was a major blow to the Nez-Percés of Looking Glass. Their homes and most of their possessions were destroyed, as were their vegetable gardens, which were ransacked and trampled by the Americans' horses. They also lost most of their horses and cattle. According to Peopeo Tholekt, three or four Nez-Percés were wounded, one fatally. A woman and her baby were also killed while attempting to cross the Clearwater north of the village, when their horse was swept away by the current. The Americans suffered no casualties.

In a report, Whipple states that ""an opportunity was given Looking Glass to surrender, which he at first promised to accept, but afterward defiantly refused, and the result was that several Indians were killed"" but Peopeo Tholekt insists that at no time did Looking Glass agree to surrender and that he instead sought to avoid meeting the soldiers.

Despite Whipple's apparent success, General Howard was not entirely satisfied with the outcome. Due to the late arrival at the camp and the loss of the element of surprise, the main objective of capturing Looking Glass and his group was not achieved. Worse still, the American army's task was complicated by the fact that Looking Glass, furious at having been treated in this way, chose to join the other Nez-Percés factions hostile to the Americans, as did the Palouse chief Husishusis Kute and his group based not far from Looking Glass's camp. This not only strengthened the ranks of the Nez-Percés fighters, but also gave them, in Looking Glass, a recognized and respected military leader who was familiar with the Montana lands to which the Amerindians would later head.

 Places of remembrance 

Since 1966, the site of the Looking Glass camp has been occupied by a fish hatchery run by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. On July 1, 2000, a wildlife observation trail was inaugurated around the site, and in 2003, a replica of an ancient bronze historical marker originally erected in 1928 was installed to commemorate the July 1, 1877 attack.

 Background 
Sahel Region, where Goulgountou is located, has been the heart of the jihadist insurgency in Burkina Faso that began in 2015 and intensified in 2019. The two main jihadist groups in the region are Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM) and Ansarul Islam. Around the time of the attacks in Goulgountou, JNIM kidnapped dozens of women and children in Arbinda.

 Attacks 
In the afternoon of January 11, jihadists attacked Volunteers for the Defense of the Homeland troops stationed at mines in Debere and Korizena, near Goulgountou, killing at least two. The attackers then went towards Goulgountou, arriving on eight motorcycles, and proceeding to intimidate worshippers inside a mosque in the neighborhood of Ticknawell. The jihadists pressured the worshippers to convert to the jihadists' sect of Islam. When the local imam argued back, the jihadists threatened to slit his throat. The imam stated he would only die standing, so he was shot. Eight other worshippers were killed in similar ways.

857,34507,75969577,12714,War crimes during the Myanmar civil war (2021–present),"The military of Myanmar (Tatmadaw) and its allies have committed numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity during the 2021–present Myanmar civil war.

Background

The military of Myanmar has been long accused of atrocities over the broader course of the ongoing conflict that has run for decades since 1948. Thaslima Begum, wrote for The Guardian that ""widespread sexual violence perpetrated by Myanmar's soldiers has been a hallmark of the culture of abuse and impunity in the country's decades-long civil wars with its ethnic minorities."" Matt Wells, the director of Amnesty International's Crisis Response program, has said that ""the Myanmar military has a blood-stained résumé of indiscriminate attacks with devastating consequences for civilians"".

Prohibited weapons

Amnesty International has documented the use of banned cluster munitions by the Tatmadaw in northern Shan State.

Massacres and civilian attacks

In October 2023, the Yangon-based Institute for Strategy and Policy wrote that the Tatmadaw had committed 22 massacres in the country since their 2021 coup d'état, defining a massacre as ""the killing of 10 or more civilians at once"". During the anti-junta forces's Operation 1027 offensive, war crimes and abuses by the Tatmadaw escalated. The military has repeatedly said it does not target civilians and often claims it is resistance forces that commit the violence.

The Tatmadaw has increased the use of its historic four cuts strategy that involves violent collective punishment against civilians. A video showed displaced people scrambling for cover under a cloud of tear gas in Myanmar.

The military used civilians as human shields, forcing people to walk ahead of troops to detonate potential landmines in their path, protecting their own troops.

In late 2021 and throughout 2022 Catholic Bayingyi villages were targeted by the Tatmadaw in Sagaing region, leading to at least 5 civilian deaths.

Over the course of a week in 2023, army troops in Sagaing killed a total of 99 villagers, beheaded 20 resistance fighters, and raped at least 3 women.

In March 2022, army troops tortured and executed at least 30 villagers during the Pinlaung massacre in Shan State, including 3 Buddhist monks. In mid-April, Myanmar Air Force bombed a celebration gathering during the Pazigyi massacre in Sagaing Region, killing at least 165 civilians, including several children, days before Thingyan, the Burmese new year. The junta's spokesperson General Zaw Min Tun stated that they chose to attack the village as the village was allegedly opening a PDF office. The United Nations condemned the attack, citing a disregard of the military's duty to protect civilians.

Attacks on religious buildings

According to Amnesty International photo and video analysis, as well as interviews with witnesses, indicated the Myanmar air force had dropped bombs on three locations near the St Peter Baptist Church in Sagaing's Kanan village on 7 January 2024, killed 17 villagers, including nine children, while at least 20 people were injured.

In 2022, the Tatmadaw looted and torched Catholic chapels in several Bayingyi villages of the Sagaing region, with clergymen targeted and arrested. The village of Chaung Yoe was reportedly the hardest hit, being attacked with artillery, leaving only 20 of the 350 buildings left standing.

Treatment of prisoners of war

Junta forces have committed severe abuses against captured rebels, including public executions and torture. As an example, on 7 November 2023, two members of the Yaw Defense Force, Phoe Tay and Thar Htaung, were publicly burned to death by junta soldiers and allied Pyusawhti militias members in the Gangaw township's Myauk Khin Yan village, Magway region, after suffering from torture. The military denied it was involved in the execution, though CNN has proven that the incident occurred at a time in which the regime was in full control of the village.

Pro-junta paramilitaries

The pro-junta Pyusawhti militias have been accused of several atrocities against civilians as well as forcibly recruiting local men by threatening to burn down their villages.

International reactions
In February 2024, Amnesty International and SAC-M urged the Security Council to refer Myanmar to the International Criminal Court (ICC). An ICC investigation in Bangladesh/Myanmar on the issue of the deportation of Rohingya from Myanmar to Bangladesh had already been opened in November 2019.

On 27 November 2024, the ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan KC filed an arrest warrant application for the Senior General and acting president Min Aung Hlaing, the commander-in-chief of the Myanmar Defence Services, for his ""criminal responsibility for the crimes against humanity of deportation and persecution of the Rohingya, committed in Myanmar, and in part in Bangladesh”.

858,5953,75137027,15930,Barrow Raiders Ladies,"Barrow Raiders Ladies are the women's rugby league team of Barrow Raiders from Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, England. They compete in the Women's Super League, and play their home games at Craven Park. Before taking the Barrow Raiders name the team were called Barrow Island Ladies.

History

In 2016, Barrow Ladies played in the Merit League and were based at Barrow Island ARLFC. They initially had difficulty in finding opponents as many of their games were cancelled. Barrow had previously had a women's team that had included Great Britain internationals such as Lindsay Anfield, Sally Milburn and Allie and Liz Kitchin, but by 2016 it had been more than ten years since Barrow had last played a competitive home fixture. Barrow entered in the 2016/17 WRLA Winter League, but by the end of January they had withdrawn from the competition and in March 2017 they joined the Women's Premier Division. At the end of April they made their Challenge Cup debut in a 58–13 loss to the Oulton Raidettes. In 2018, Barrow recorded their first win in the Challenge Cup defeating Brighouse Rangers 62–10 to reach the second round (quarter-finals). In 2019, Barrow finished second in the Championship. On 15 September, for their final home game of the regular season, Barrow faced Oulton in the first women's game to be played at Craven Park. Barrow reached the Championship Grand Final with a 14–12 semi-final victory over Stanningley, but lost 40–4 to  who had also knocked Barrow out of the Challenge Cup earlier in the season. In 2020, Barrow were to face Warrington in the second round of the Challenge Cup again. However, a week before the match the RFL suspended all competitions.

On 14 March 2021, it was announced that Barrow Island Ladies had been adopted by Barrow Raiders to form Barrow Raiders Ladies. In the 2021 season, Barrow reached the Grand Final of the Championship by defeating Widnes Vikings 16–6 in the play-offs. They lost the final 10–6 to the league leaders, , but a top two finish in the league meant promotion along with Leigh to Group 2 of the Super League. In November 2021, Amanda Wilkinson was appointed as Head Coach. The 2022 season began for Barrow with the Challenge Cup. After defeats to  and Warrington, a 36–0 win over the  was not enough for Barrow to progress from the group stage. Barrow made their Super League debut on 15 May with a 32–6 loss at home to Warrington. Barrow finished second in Group 2 before losing 12–10 to  in the play-off semi-final. As with the 2022 season, Barrow began 2023 with two defeats in the Challenge Cup before ending their campaign with a win; 20–11 over . A closely fought Super League competition saw the top three teams in Group 2 (, Barrow and Featherstone) separated by only one point going into the final day of the regular season. In the last round of matches Barrow defeated Leigh but missed out on automatic promotion as they finished behind the league leaders, Featherstone, on points difference. However, a 14–8 victory over Leigh in the Group 2 Final secured their place in the restructured Super League in 2024. In the 2024 season, Barrow exited the Challenge Cup at the group stage, but their performance in the Super League saw them finish in fifth place and earned Amanda Wilkinson a nomination for the coach of the year award.

Analysis of Results
In the Ardee LEA all 6 sitting Councillors retained their seats though Fine Gael ran close for a third seat and geography was a factor as sitting Councillor Bernie Conlon prevailed on the last count. In Drogheda Rural there was no change in party representation though International Boxing Champion, Eric Donovan, outpolled and unseated his fellow running-mate Clogherhead based Cllr Tom Cunningham. In Drogheda Urban Fine Gael regained the seat that they lost at the 2019 Locals at the expense of the Labour Party as co-opted Cllr Emma Cutlip was defeated. In Dundalk South all seats were retained though Independent Ireland pushed hard, following transfers from the Irish Freedom Party, to challenge for the final seat as Cllr Marianne Butler of the Green Party prevailed with transfers. In the Dundalk-Carlingford LEA, Sinn Féin retained their two seats through good internal party transfers after eliminations but there was considerable leakage in the Fianna Fáil vote which was also not well managed among the three sitting Councillors. First time candidate, Independent Ciarán Fisher, was elected at the expense of incumbent Councillor Conor Keelan. This resulted in Fianna Fáil returning with a net loss of one seat and the loss of their then Party Whip on the Council.

860,16237,5298442,9474,Shepperton Lock,"Shepperton Lock is a lock on the River Thames, in England by the left bank at Shepperton, Surrey. It is across the river from Weybridge which is nearby linked by a passenger ferry.

In 1813, the City of London Corporation built the pound lock and the short cuts (cuttings) – the nearer expanded an existing meander cutoff, beyond which lies a fresh cutting and old main stream of the river. These each have associated weirs. Shepperton Weir is between Shepperton Lock Island and Hamhaugh Island; and Shepperton Upper Weir is between Hamhaugh Island and the Hamm Court area of Addlestone, Surrey on the opposite bank.

Upstream of the lock island is the Thames Court pub/restaurant on the near bank, downstream of Pharaoh's Island which was given to Lord Nelson after the Battle of the Nile in 1798. The lock is the fifth from the estuary of the river of a total of forty-five.

History

A weir is recorded at Shepperton in the 1086 Domesday Book and in the 14th century.'Shepperton: The hundred of Spelthorne (continued)', in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 3, ed. Susan Reynolds (London, 1962), pp. 1-12. British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol3/pp1-12 A reference to a sluice or dam at Shepperton occurs in 1293 and tolls being raised on passing barges which would imply a flash lock.

The lock was built in 1813 on the site of a small watercourse known as Stoner's Gut which ran across the meander cutoff. Stoner's Gut had posed difficulties to navigation and barges usually went to Weybridge including from the 17th century up the Wey and Godalming Navigations to the south. Various accounts at the end of the 18th century record flood waters using the gut and of a chapel built on piles over the river which was washed away. An alike event in one account washed away much of the main church of the town downstream by the river, prompting its being largely rebuilt in 1614. The gut was for a time dammed. In 1805 came the first suggestion for a lock. After strong opposition, the proposal was put forward again in 1809 and a wooden lock was subsequently built. A stone lock was built in 1899, next to the existing wooden one which was then filled in and removed.

A small island upstream of the lock, was called Dog Ait at some point. This became corrupted into ""Dockett"" as in Dockett Eddy Lane. Dog Ait is shown on 19th century Ordnance Survey maps (1883, 1896) as being the previous name for Pharaoh's Island.

Access to the lock
The lock is on the left bank, and can be reached from a lane with two entrances having a name for its two halves, the eastern from Old Shepperton has a walkway, the lane adjoins the towpath (Thames Path). More than two parking areas exist. From the Weybridge side the lock can be reached by the ferry.

Immediately above the lock is Pharaoh's Island, a gift from the nation to Admiral Nelson following the Battle of the Nile. It did not gain its name until the early 20th century. The left bank is more open and has riverside houses until Dumsey Meadow a Site of Special Scientific Interest.Biodiversity action Reporting System, Dumsey Meadow  The right bank  is built up at the edge of Chertsey itself, has a water meadows public park at Chertsey Meads with playground and a low-rise residential estate close to the lock, the Hamm Court area of Addlestone, Surrey.

Chertsey Bridge crosses the river 210  metres below Chertsey Lock. The right bank weir pool at the top of the reach becomes the Abbey River, nearly adjoining the site of the Anglo-Saxon Chertsey Abbey. Chertsey Regatta in skiffing is held alongside Dumsey Meadow in August.

Sports and businesses
The opposite bank is close to two rowing clubs and a large canoeing and kayaking club. Weybridge Ait has a recreational rowing club, Weyfarers R.C. The Environment Agency has a control centre and boats on the Lock Island. A nautical shop and boat repair business is on the near side.

Thames Path
The Thames Path changes to the left, northern (""Middlesex"") bank to Chertsey Lock and passes through the sharp meander Dumsey Meadow, a site of Special Scientific Interest.

866,60452,76752431,5406,Awasthia,"Awasthia is a monotypic fungal genus in the family Physciaceae. It contains the single species Awasthia melanotricha, a foliose lichen found in the Nepal Himalayas.

Taxonomy
This lichen was first formally described by the Indian lichenologist Dharani Dhar Awasthi in 1957. He gathered the type specimen from above the banks of the Saju Pokhari near Topke Gola, at an elevation ranging from , thriving on moist sandy soil alongside mosses and grasses. Awasthi chose the species epithet melanotricha following a suggestion from Adolf Hugo Magnusson. Ted Esslinger circumscribed Awasthia in 1978 to contain the species, characterised by its unusually branched rhizines and the presence of the substances gyrophoric and lecanoric acids. The genus names honours Awasthi, ""well known Indian lichenologist, a student of the Physciaceae, and the collector of the type material"". Esslinger noted that due to the lack of apothecia and spores, the placement of the genus in the Physciaceae was to be considered tentative.

Description
Awasthia melanotricha is a foliose lichen, meaning its body (thallus) is leaf-like and loosely attaches to its . It forms nearly circular patches, typically measuring  across, with  that rise slightly from the surface. These lobes are intricately branched in a pattern that resembles repeated forks (subdichotomously branched) and are often layered over each other (d). Each lobe is typically 1.5–2 mm wide, narrowing to about 1 mm at the tips, and has a gently channeled () surface extending to its ends, giving them a concave appearance on the upper side. The edges of the lobes are generally smooth but may be slightly uneven.

When moist, the thallus is leathery and flexible but becomes brittle when dry. In preserved (herbarium) specimens, the lobes may twist around to reveal the underside. The upper surface of the thallus is smooth, dark greyish-brown to brownish-black, often lighter at the tips. The underside is black, densely covered with short, black, branched, and rough-surfaced hair-like outgrowths (rhizines]) that are about 1 mm long and 0.1 mm thick at the base. The lichen does not produce soredia or isidia, which are structures used by some lichens for reproduction.

The thallus structure includes a top layer (upper ) made of tightly packed, roundish to slightly angular cells, creating a protective covering about 16–20 μm thick. Below this, there is a layer of green algal cells (genus Protococcus), each up to 10 μm in size, forming an  about 20–25 μm thick that aids in photosynthesis. The central layer (medulla) consists of tightly packed, longitudinally aligned fungal filaments (hyphae), appearing compact in cross-section and sometimes resembling the upper cortex due to their density. These hyphae are about 4 μm thick with thick walls. Below the cortex, the structure becomes more loosely packed () and darker. Chemical spot tests on the upper cortex and medulla show no reaction, indicating the absence of certain lichen products often used for identification. Awasthia melanotricha is sterile, meaning it does not produce reproductive structures (apothecia) typical of many lichens.",2024-04-27,"['Caliciales' 'Caliciales genera' 'Lichen genera' 'Taxa described in 1978'

868,49000,76398383,2875,Holmes Coote,"Holmes Coote (10 November 1817 – December 1872) was an English surgeon.

Biography
Coote was born on 10 November 1817, and was second son of Richard Holmes Coote, a conveyancer. He was educated at Westminster School, and at the age of sixteen was made apprentice to Sir William Lawrence, one of the surgeons to St. Bartholomew's Hospital. In 1845 he obtained a prize at the College of Surgeons for an essay ‘On the Anatomy of the Fibres of the Human Brain, illustrated by the Anatomy of the same parts in the Lower Vertebrata.’ His first book was published in 1849, ‘The Homologies of the Human Skeleton,’ and is an explanation of the relation of the several bones of the human skeleton to the parts of the archetype skeleton of Richard Owen. It is a mere piece of book-work. He was elected demonstrator of anatomy in the St. Bartholomew's Medical School, and continued to teach in the dissecting-room till elected assistant surgeon in 1854. Shortly after he received leave from the governors of the hospital to be absent as civil surgeon in charge of the wounded from the Crimean war at Smyrna. After his return he published ‘A Report on some of the more important Points in the Treatment of Syphilis,’ 1857, and in 1863 he was elected surgeon to the hospital. Besides some shorter writings, Coote published in the ‘St. Bartholomew's Hospital Reports’ three papers on diseases of the joints (vols. i. and ii.), one on the treatment of wounds (vol. vi.), on rickets (vol. v.), on operations for stone (vol. iv.), and one on a case of aneurysm. In 1867 he published a volume ‘On Joint Diseases.’ He wrote easily, but without much collected observation, thought, or research, and it is only as evidence of the practice of his period that his works deserve consultation. He was a tall man of burly frame, of kindly disposition and convivial tastes. He married twice, but was never in easy circumstances, nor attained much practice. While still in the prime of life he looked older than his years, and was attacked by general paralysis with delusions of boundless wealth, and died in December 1872.",2024-11-12,"['1817 births' '1872 deaths' '19th-century British surgeons'

They are members of the North Division of the National Football Conference (NFC) and play their home games at Lambeau Field in central Wisconsin.

In 1974, Pro Football Writers of America (PFWA) began compiling an annual NFL All-Rookie Team made up of the best rookies at each position for the preceding season. The teams are selected by the sportswriters that make up the PFWA. For only one NFL All-Rookie Team, in 1976, the PFWA selected a first-team and second-team; all other teams do not have a distinction. From 1992 to 2012, the All-Rookie Teams were chosen jointly by PFWA and Pro Football Weekly.

The Packers have had 35 players named to 26 NFL All-Rookie Teams. No Packers were selected in the inaugural NFL All-Rookie Team in 1974; Johnnie Gray became the Packers' first selection after the 1975 NFL season. The most Packers named to one team came in 2006, when the trio of Greg Jennings, Daryn Colledge and A. J. Hawk were selected. On seven other occasions, two Packers have been selected to one team. Twice, the Packers have had an All-Rookie Team selection also given an NFL Rookie of the Year Award: Tom Flynn in 1984 and Eddie Lacy in 2013. Six All-Rookie Team selections have gone on to be inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame, with one of those—James Lofton—also inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

872,39460,76119089,16529,Recognition of same-sex unions in Zimbabwe,"Zimbabwe does not recognize same-sex marriages or civil unions. The Marriages Act does not provide for the recognition of same-sex marriage, and civil partnerships are only available to opposite-sex couples. The Constitution of Zimbabwe explicitly prohibits same-sex marriages.

Historical recognition of same-sex relationships
While many modern-day Zimbabwean cultures historically practiced polygamy, there are no records of same-sex marriages as understood from a Western perspective being performed in those cultures. However, there is evidence for identities and behaviours that may be placed on the LGBT spectrum. In the 1990s, Canadian researcher Marc Epprecht wrote about pederastic marriages in colonial Zimbabwe. Contemporary oral evidence suggests that same-sex relationships were ""common"" and ""prevalent"" in Zimbabwe in the early 20th century, with research by Epprecht estimating that between 70% and 80% of men at the mines took on male sexual partners. It was during this time through the mining compounds and the influence of the Zulu language that the contemporary term , meaning ""homosexual"", entered the Shona language. These relationships differed strongly from the Western understanding of same-sex marriages, as men who entered these ""mine marriages"" continued to marry women and ""conform, or appear to conform, to gender expectations"", and would not consider themselves as homosexual or bisexual, or ""unfaithful to [their] marriage vows"". Epprecht further wrote that ""enabling migrant men to conserve their health and resources against the temptations of [local] women [in towns near the mines], ngochani strengthened their ability to shore up proper, fecund marriages [back home]"". This practice gradually disappeared as Zimbabwe became more modernized and exposed to Western culture and homophobia in the 20th century.

Among the San peoples, marriage (Tshwa: ) is generally between a man in his twenties and a girl in her teens, though polygamy is common. Evidence suggests that same-sex sexual activity was previously ""common and relatively accepted"" by the San peoples.

Legal history

Background
Although in very close proximity, South Africa and Zimbabwe have contrasting political histories in their post-colonial states with regard to LGBT rights. While South Africa's post-apartheid state entrenched LGBT rights in its constitution and legalised same-sex marriage in November 2006, making it the first African nation and the fifth in the world to recognise same-sex marriages, Zimbabwe's post-independent state has strongly opposed homosexuality and same-sex unions. Gays and lesbians experience severe societal and legal discrimination in Zimbabwe, often fleeing to South Africa ""to enjoy greater freedom"".

Restrictions
The Marriages Act (; ), enacted in 2022 by the Parliament of Zimbabwe, defines civil marriage as ""[being] monogamous, that is to say, it is the lawful union of two persons to the exclusion of all others and no person may contract any other marriage during the subsistence of a marriage under the general law."" Although it does not explicitly forbid same-sex marriages, it generally refers to married spouses as ""man"" and ""woman"". Civil partnerships, legalised with the passage of this new law in 2022, are explicitly defined as being between ""a man and a woman"" who are both over the age of eighteen years, and have lived together on a genuine domestic basis without legally being married. However, Article 78 of the Constitution of Zimbabwe contains an explicit ban on same-sex marriages:

This ban was introduced in 2013 following the adoption of a new constitution. The previous constitution enacted in 1980 did not contain such a ban. The new constitution was presented to Parliament on 5 February 2013 and subsequently approved in a referendum on 16 March 2013. Parliament approved it on 9 May and President Robert Mugabe signed it into law on 22 May 2013.

Religious performance
The Catholic Church opposes same-sex marriage and does not allow its priests to officiate at such marriages. In December 2023, the Holy See published Fiducia supplicans, a declaration allowing Catholic priests to bless couples who are not considered to be married according to church teaching, including the blessing of same-sex couples. However, the Zimbabwe Catholic Bishops' Conference issued a statement on 22 December that ""locally, many Catholics and those who look up to the Catholic Church are asking questions and wondering if the declaration marks a paradigm shift in the doctrine of the Church on marriage. While we have great appreciation of the declaration and the guidance it gives on blessings, we are also sensitive to the anxiety and confusion that has arisen. We would like to reiterate that the declaration is not about the change of the doctrine on marriage and neither is it about an approval of same sex unions in the Church. It is about blessings. In respect of the law of the land, our culture and for moral reasons we instruct pastors to desist from actions that may be deemed as the blessing of same-sex unions bringing confusion and even scandal to our people.""

In 2015, the General Synod of the Dutch Reformed Church voted by a 64% majority to recognise same-sex marriages, bless the relationships of same-sex couples and allow gay ministers and clergy (who are not required to be celibate). The decision applies to 9 of the 10 synods; with the Namibia Synod being excluded, but it does apply to the Northern Synod, which include parts of Zimbabwe. The decision caused backlash and objections, resulting in it being reversed a year later. A dozen church members subsequently took the denomination to court to restore the 2015 decision. In 2019, the North Gauteng High Court reversed the decision, ruling that while religious organizations have the religious freedom to define marriage the 2016 decision was not made in accordance with the church's own proper process. Individual pastors are free to choose whether to bless same-sex marriages; a freedom of conscience clause allows pastors with objections to opt out of performing same-sex weddings.

890,20164,5305015,8323,"William Ponsonby, 1st Baron de Mauley","William Francis Spencer Ponsonby, 1st Baron de Mauley (31 July 1787 – 16 May 1855), was an English Whig politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1826 and 1837. He was raised to the Peerage in 1838.

Life

Ponsonby was the youngest child of the 3rd Earl of Bessborough and his wife Henrietta Ponsonby, Countess of Bessborough.

Ponsonby was elected Member of Parliament for Poole in 1826 and held the seat until 1831, when he lost it in a by-election to Lord Ashley. He was then MP for Knaresborough between June and December 1832. At the 1832 UK general election, he was elected MP for Dorset and held the seat until 1837. On 10 July 1838, he was created Baron de Mauley, of Canford in the County of Dorset. Whilst an MP for Poole, Ponsonby, and Benjamin Lester opened Poole's first public library in 1830.

When the marriage of his sister Lady Caroline to William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, began to break up, he strongly supported Caroline.Lord David Cecil, Melbourne, Pan Books edition 1965, p. 151. Unfortunately, he was not noted for tact or intelligence—Melbourne's sister Emily Lamb, Countess Cowper, described him as being universally regarded as ""an ass and a jackanapes"". Ponsonby reminded Melbourne that the Lamb family were socially parvenu, and that his sister had married beneath her; although true, these remarks were so tactless that Melbourne broke off any further dealings with him.

Family
On 8 August 1814, Ponsonby married Lady Barbara Ashley-Cooper (the only daughter and heir of the 5th Earl of Shaftesbury and a co-heir of the medieval barony of Mauley, 1789–1844). They had three children:

 Hon. Charles Frederick Ashley Cooper (1815–1896, later the 2nd Baron de Mauley)
 Hon. Frances Anne Georgiana (1817–1910), married George Kinnaird, 9th Lord Kinnaird.

This name means that God, in Islam, is the one who is singled out in all aspects of perfection and that nothing else shares perfectness with him. Moreover, the name is seen by the Muslims to be a direction for them to worship him alone and associate with no partners, as he is seen as the only one who has all the perfect attributes.

 Bilal ibn Rabah and Al-Aḥad 
Bilal ibn Rabah was a companion of the prophet of Islam, Muhammad; he was an enslaved black man and was persecuted in Mecca before it was under Islamic rule by his slave owner. The slave owner tortured him because he converted to Islam. Bilal's slave owner asked him to leave his religion and that he would stop touting him as soon as he did so. Instead of leaving Islam, Bilal kept on calling on God and saying: ""Ahad, Ahad"" while being tortured. This story of Bilal shows the significance of God's name, al-Aḥad, since the beginning of Islam for the Muslim creed.

893,18236,75507608,8398,Rushmere Shopping Centre,"Rushmere Shopping Centre (formerly known as the Craigavon Shopping Centre or the Craigavon Centre) is a shopping centre and retail park in Craigavon, County Armagh, Northern Ireland.

Opened in 1976, the centre is the one of the oldest and the third largest shopping centre in Northern Ireland, behind Belfast's Victoria Square and Derry's Foyleside, at over 350,000 sq ft, although combined with the retail park makes it over 480,000 sq ft. The anchor tenant of the centre is Primark, while the retail park's anchor is Matalan. It also has a 24 hour gym.

 History 
On 21 September 1976, Rushmere opened to the public as the Craigavon Shopping Centre, and the anchor tenants were Dunnes Stores and Crazy Prices along with stores such as Marley Homecare and Eason.

In 1998, the Craigavon Shopping Centre reopened as Rushmere as part of a major expansion which saw a Sainsbury's and Tesco store open, the latter replacing Crazy Prices due to their buyout in 1997. The expansion also introduced a retail park with retailers Homebase, Matalan, Index and JJB Sports. The site was expanded again in 2004 with Debenhams opening as the main tenant in a 150,000 sq ft extension of the centre on October 21, and again in 2018 with Nando's and Five Guys opening.

In January 2011, Tesco closed its doors to move to a much larger store near the centre. The unit was later subdivided into two units, with the units being occupied by Home Bargains and Discount NI, which left Debenhams and Sainsbury's as the remaining anchors.

During the early 2020s, Rushmere had a major drop in footfall and tenants resulting in the closures of Topshop, Five Guys, a mixed Dorothy Perkins and Burton store, Debenhams and Sainsbury's, this was mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2022, the company which owned Rushmere, Moyallen Holdings Limited (which also owned the nearby Magowan West in Portadown and Victoria Place in Woking) was placed into administration, Killahoey Ltd bought the struggling shopping centre from the company later in 2023. In the same year, Primark opened on the ground floor of the former Debenhams.

In 2023, Rushmere began a redevelopment scheme to enhance the shopping experience, with a complete facelift to the centre, new stores and a subdivision of the former Sainsbury's supermarket into multiple stores, it was finished in January 2025. A new Lidl supermarket is also planned.

 Stores and Entertainment 
The shopping complex includes 70+ stores such as Argos, Boots, Dunnes Stores, JD Sports, Mango, New Look, Primark, Schuh, Søstrene Grene, TK Maxx and Waterstones, and eateries/cafes such as Caffè Nero, McDonald's and Nando's.

For leisure and entertainment, the centre runs a singing stage known as Rushmere Sounds, the centre also has a 24 hour gym operated by PureGym.",2025-02-14,"['Shopping centres in Northern Ireland'

It comprises three services and began operation in 2015. Services are operated by SBB GmbH, Swiss Federal Railways' German subsidiary, and Thurbo.

Regional railway services in the city of Schaffhausen and other nearby towns are complemented by services of Zürich S-Bahn (S9, S12, S24, S29, S33), St. Gallen S-Bahn (S1), the Seehas (S6), and RB30 of Basel S-Bahn. The system is also supported by bus routes of vbsh.

 Lines 
 the network consists of the following lines (S62 is also part of Bodensee S-Bahn):

 :  –  – ,  using the High Rhine Railway line
 : Schaffhausen – Beringen Bad Bf – , using the High Rhine Railway line
 : Schaffhausen –  – , using the Eglisau–Neuhausen railway and Rheinfall Railway lines

 History and future projects 
Before operations began, several structural measures had to be taken on the existing railway system, such as the electrification of the line between Schaffhausen and Erzingen, replacement of level crossings with bridges in Neuhausen am Rheinfall and Beringen, refurbishing of the station in Jestetten, and the constructions of the new railway stations  and .

The line to Erzingen opened with the timetable change in December 2013 and the line to Jestetten in December 2015. The regional service to Singen (Hohentwiel) was taken over by EMUs of SBB GmbH/THURBO in 2022 (until then operated by DMUs of DB Regio Baden-Württemberg). The name Rhyhas (; in reference to the Seehas) was chosen by vote for this line. With the 10 December 2023 timetable change the three existing S-Bahn routes gained numbers (until then just an ""S"" without number was indicated on displays).

Hemishofen and Ramsen, situated in the eastern part of the canton of Schaffhausen, are located along the Etzwilen–Singen railway line, which is a heritage railway since 2007. There are currently no concrete plans to reactivate this line for scheduled passenger trains.

Altenburg-Rheinau railway station on the Eglisau–Neuhausen railway line was closed in 2010. There are presently no plans to reopen it.

It was the first coronation since 1722 and only the second since 1654 due to the longevity of the two previous monarchs, Louis XIV and Louis XV. 

The city of Reims in Champagne was the traditional site of French coronations, a ceremony that stretched back in some form to the baptism of Clovis I in the city. The ceremony was performed by Charles Antoine de La Roche-Aymon, the Archbishop of Reims. Louis was crowned alone, his wife Marie Antoinette, whom he had married in 1770 in a dynastic match to support the Franco-Austrian alliance,Caiani p.176 was not crowned as by the 18th century Queens weren't crowned. The couple were childless at the time of the coronation but went on to have several children following the birth of Marie-Thérèse de France in 1778.

In contrast to his predecessors Louis XVI rejected a role as leader of fashion and ceremony, and as soon as the coronation was over he took off his heavy coronation robes and never wore them again. He preferred lighter and less ceremonial dress at court.Jones p.508

898,13945,75374006,10409,Ezzedine Kalak," 

Ezzedine Kalak (; 1936–1978) was a member of the Fatah and served as the representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in France from 1973 to his assassination in Paris on 3 August 1978. He was killed by the Abu Nidal group.

Early life and education
Kalak was born in Haifa, Mandatory Palestine, in 1936. He was named after Ezzeddin Al Qassam, leader of the Arab revolt in Palestine between 1936 and 1939. Kalak had seven siblings. 

Kalak was educated in Haifa until Nakba in 1948 when the family had to leave Palestine and settled in Damascus. Following his graduation from high school he attended Damascus University. During his studies he joined a literary group and published short stories in the Syrian newspapers. He also became a member of the Syrian Communist Party while studying at the university. He was imprisoned for three years due to his Communist activities from 1959 and 1961. After his release from prison he translated and published American and Chinese short stories. He graduated from Damascus University in 1963 obtaining a degree in chemistry. 

Kalak received a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from the University of Poitiers in the late 1960s. During his studies in France he joined the Fatah and was elected head of the General Union of Palestinian Students in France.

Career and activities
Following his graduation from Damascus University Kalak worked as a teacher in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, until 1965. He settled in Paris after he completed his Ph.D. and worked for Radio Monte Carlo as a translator. He established a magazine entitled Fedayeen () in Paris in 1970. During this period he began to work with Mahmoud Hamshari, PLO's representative in France. Kalak was instrumental in getting support from French artists, including Serge Le Péron and Claude Lazar, for the Palestinian cause. Through Kalak's initiatives the French artists produced posters and contributed to the exhibitions and other artistic events in support of Palestinian resistance movement.

Kalak succeeded Hamshari as  representative of the PLO in France in September 1973 after the assassination of Hamshari by Mossad agents. The PLO office was semi-officially recognized by France on 31 October 1975 and was reopened at the Arab League headquarters in the Boulevard Haussmann in Paris. Kalak was the first Palestinian official  invited to Élysée Palace to attend a ceremony held for the Saudi Arabian King Khalid in 1978.

Kalak collected Palestinian political posters from the 1960s and 1970s. These were archived by  Poster House in New York City which donated them to the Watson Library.

Assassination
Kalak and his aide Adnan Hammad were shot to death at the PLO Office in Paris on 3 August 1978. Three other people were also injured in the attack. 

The perpetrators were Hatem Husni and Kayad Assad who were the members of the Black June, part of the Abu Nidal Organization, a revolutionary Palestinian group. They were university students in France and were both Jordanians of Palestinian origin. Husni and Assad were arrested immediately after the murder. They were sentenced to fifteen years in prison in March 1980. However, they were released from prison in 1986 and deported from France as a result of the negotiations between the government of France and Abu Nidal Organization. Through the deal the terrorist attacks of the Abu Nidal Organization in France were terminated. Following their release from prison Hatem Husni and Kayad Assad met with Abu Nidal, leader of the Abu Nidal Organization, at an undisclosed location.  

A funeral ceremony for Kalak and Adnan Hammad was held at the Grand Mosque, Paris, and Kalak was buried in Damascus on 5 August 1978. Hammad was buried in Beirut, Lebanon.",2025-04-18,"['20th-century Palestinian diplomats' '20th-century Palestinian writers'

899,49142,76400377,8268,Juan Carlos Villa,"Juan Carlos Villa Cardona (born 1991) is a Colombian serial killer. He confessed to being responsible for the death of 11 people: 10 older adults and one minor; the last three murders were perpetrated by Juan Carlos and his brother, José Alfredo Villa, who also accepted his participation in several crimes. All the murders were committed between 2012 and 2023, in depopulated areas of the Risaralda Department.

The authorities declared him a ""serial killer"", his modus operandi consisted of posing as a person with a disability to gain their trust and then murder them with knives. Most of the victims had wounds on the back of the thorax. At the time of his capture, he accepted without regret the direct participation in all the murders, one of the psychological and behavioral characteristics of a serial killer.

Murders
The first murders occurred in March 2012. The bodies of Francisco Javier Gaviria Valencia and Fanny Ortiz Cruz were found in a sidewalk located in the municipality of Marsella. The authorities indicated that Villa and his father perpetrated the murders, in addition to stealing money from one of the older adults. In 2013, he killed a cheese merchant in Pereira, on a trail located between the neighborhoods of Kennedy and Comuneros de Dosquebradas. In October 2021, he did the same with 66-year-old Holmes Giraldo Restrepo, whom he attacked in a room in the Llano Grande Alto neighborhood of Pereira. In May 2023 he murdered Henry López Giraldo in complicity with his brother José Alfredo Villa. They tried to steal a copper cable from López Giraldo. In August of that same year, Villa perpetrated 4 other murders, a body of one of his victims was found on the El Espinazo farm, in the El Santuario municipality. The last homicide was recorded on 23 September, on a farm in Dosquebradas.

Modus operandi
The modus operandi consisted of gaining the trust of the people with whom Villa interacted, specifically in the municipalities of Pereira, Dosquebradas, Santa Rosa de Cabal, Marsella and Santuario, places where he moved constantly. He presented himself in these places as a person with a disability with the aim of collecting information to later commit robberies and murders. After his capture, he confessed to being responsible for the 11 murders and his brother declared that he directly participated in 2 homicides. According to authorities, it is likely that they have committed many other murders.

Imprisonment
Villa was arrested on 27 September 2023. On 20 March 2024, he was sentenced to 45 years imprisonment.",2024-05-27,"['1991 births' 'Living people' 'People from Risaralda Department'

900,18591,75511968,19170,ARMH1,"Armadillo-like Helical Domain Containing 1 (ARMH1) is a protein which in humans is encoded by chromosome 1 open reading frame 228, also known as the ARMH1 gene. The gene shows expression levels significantly higher in bone marrow, lymph nodes, and testis. Currently the function of this gene and subsequent protein is still uncertain.

 Gene 
The ARMH1 gene is found on the plus strand of chromosome 1 between base pairs 45,140,361 and 45,191,784. Other known aliases include P40, NCRNA00082, and most commonly C1orf228. The gene has 13 exons, most of which are concentrated near the poly-A site at the end of the gene and two located upstream from the start codon. The gene is highly expressed in bone marrow and lymph nodes, suggesting an immunological function.https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=ARMH1>

 Gene expression 
RNA seq data was produced using multiple samples of human tissues at varying stages of development. One study was acquired from 20 separate samples of human tissue showing significantly more expression of ARMH1 in the thymus, trachea, and lungs. A second study shows 27 different tissues samples in 95 different individual subjects. The expression levels are significantly higher in bone marrow, lymph nodes, and testis. A third shows high expression in white blood cells and testis again, corroborating previous studies. A temporal study focused on expression in different stages of development collected 35 human fetal samples, from 6 distinct tissues, between 10 and 20 weeks gestational time and sequenced using Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA. The data slightly favored expression in the adrenal glands throughout development. In each of the other tissues there were no stark changes in expression through time, only a small decline of gene expression as development furthers.

 Gene transcripts 
The ARMH1 gene has extensive abilities to alter its function and size through isoforms. Gene isoforms are mRNAs that are produced from the same locus but are different in their transcription start sites, protein coding DNA sequences and/or untranslated regions, potentially altering gene function. All known isoforms are organized and listed below with information gathered from NCBI gene, and a Bioinformatics tool for calculating molecular weight.

 mRNA 
The mRNA for this gene can be spliced in many different ways, making way for approximately 20 known isoforms. The most common mRNA gets spliced down to a coding region that is about 1693 nucleotides long which makes up 440 amino acids in total.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/339541> In a comprehensive study on oral squamous cell carcinoma, the sixth most prevalent cancer worldwide, identified ARMH1 as a gene of interest by comparing healthy subjects mRNA against affected individuals. Through mRNA inhibition of ARMH1, researchers demonstrated significantly reduced leukemic cell proliferation (P=.0041) and leukemic cell migration (P=.0001), as well as a decreased resistance to the chemotherapy drug Cytarabine.

 Protein 
The protein encoded by the gene goes by the same name, Armadillo like containing helical domain 1. The isoelectric point of the ARMH1 protein is around a pH of 5.5. The protein has 2 known major domains, one being a transmembrane domain and the other being a coiled coil.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Acembly/av.cgi?c=geneid&org=9606&l=339541> Within the coiled coil domains, the ARMH1 protein has 24 alpha helices. The European Bioinformatics Institute's analysis of ARMH1 reveals clearly a significantly enriched lysine content as well as a significantly deficient proline count. The protein has been proven to have one major interaction with the human protein known as ABAT.  Gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase (ABAT) catalyzes the conversion of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) into succinic semialdehyde. Additionally, ABAT expression was associated with glycolysis-related genes, infiltrated immune cells, immunoinhibitors, and immunostimulators in HCC.

 Homology and evolution 
The ARMH1 gene is extremely diverse and is found in thousands of different species. From primates to fungus, this gene has been evolutionarily relevant for hundreds of millions of years. While in near relatives such as cows, the similarity score is 91% that of our genome, in species of fungi the similarity ranges between 20 and 30%. While attempting to find homologs in any round or flat worms, single celled eukaryotes or prokaryotes, plants, or any fungi besides chitrids, there were no significantly similar genes found. Below is a table of orthologous genes in order of sequence similarity compared to the human ARMH1 isoform X1.

 Clinical significance 
The ARMH1 gene and subsequent protein have been extensively linked to leukemia, specifically T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). In mostly lymphatic tissue cell lines, T-ALL showed dramatically increased expression of the ARMH1 gene. Bone marrow samples were taken at the initial diagnosis and the conclusion of treatment and ARMH1 along with 5 other genes that were all found to be dramatically changed in expression. Researchers Dr. Manoj Bhasin and Dr. Mojtaba Bakhtiari from Emory University's Aflac Cancer Center have identified ARMH1, a novel cancer-associated gene, as being highly expressed in malignant blast cells across several pediatric hematologic malignancies, including AML, T/B-ALL, and T/B-MPAL. Importantly, ARMH1 expression is significantly elevated in patients with relapsed disease or high-risk cytogenetic profiles (e.g., MLL rearrangements) compared to those with standard-risk markers (e.g., RUNX1, inv(16)). Additionally, ARMH1 expression strongly correlates with the pediatric leukemia stem cell score (LSC6), a six-gene signature linked to poor prognosis.

Functional studies involving ARMH1 perturbation (via knockdown and overexpression) in leukemia cell lines revealed substantial effects on cell proliferation and migration. RNA sequencing of these modified cells highlighted associations between ARMH1 and pathways related to mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis and the cell cycle. Pharmacological inhibition of CPT1A, a key regulator of fatty acid synthesis in the mitochondrial matrix, led to ARMH1 downregulation, along with reduced CPT1A levels, ATP production, and oxygen consumption rates. Furthermore, ARMH1 knockdown caused a notable decrease in cell cycle regulators, including CDCA7 and EZH2.

The research also uncovered that ARMH1 physically interacts with EZH2, a protein implicated in multiple cancers, suggesting its critical role in oncogenesis. These findings establish ARMH1 as a key player in mitochondrial metabolism and cell cycle regulation, positioning it as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in pediatric hematologic malignancies.",2025-01-15,['Genes on human chromosome 1'],"['open reading frame' 'bone marrow' 'lymph node' 'testis'

906,37058,76050052,4999,Housewives of Japan,"Housewives of Japan: An Ethnography of Real Lives and Consumerized Domesticity is a 2012 book by Ofra Goldstein-Gidoni, published by Palgrave Macmillan.

The book covers the 2000s. The research subject is a group of women, who primarily work to care for their households, in one residential complex in Osaka.Alexy, p. 198. The book explores the concept behind the term ""professional housewife"" (専業主婦 sengyō shufu).Kalicki, p. 604.

Background
A friend of the author,Alexy, p. 199. Mariko Ishikawa, had e-mailed her on whether a housewife would be better off being regarded as a ""professional"" in that field or not. This prompted the development of the book. Ishikawa became the co-designer of the academic study. Communication was done by e-mail, and fifty women were interviewed.Klien, p. 497.

Contents
There are three portions in the book. Part I has chapters 1-2. Part II has chapters 3-5 has the information about the ethnography. Part III has chapters 6-7 and explains the evolution on what housewives do in Japanese society.

The first chapter explains how the author conducted research. The second chapter discusses the ""housewife debate"" (主婦論争 shufu ronsō) and ""housewifeization"" (主婦か shufu-ka). 

The third chapter has testimonies from the various housewives on what they do in their households, while the fourth chapter has their testimonies about their relationships with their spouses, who are salarymen. The fifth chapter discusses how the women conduct their lives. 

The sixth chapter discusses media portrayals and the seventh chapter describes how the author feels that society is becoming paleoconservative.   There is an afterword after chapter 7 which is an epilogue for the people who gave testimonies.

Reception
Allison Alexy of the University of Virginia, described it as a ""fascinating"" work, and she had a positive reception on how the book covered divergent, conflicting opinions held by the housewives.

Konrad Kalicki of the University of British Columbia wrote that the work ""is worth reading"", citing the "" rich empirical content"" as the main factor; Kalicki argued that there are some flaws in the research methodology.Kalicki, p. 606.

Susanne Klien of Hokkaido University described the book as ""compelling"".Klien, p. 498.",2024-12-31,"['Books about women' 'Books about Japan' 'Palgrave Macmillan books'

History

Kleczew received town rights in 1366. It was a private town administratively located in the Konin County in the Kalisz Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland. A route connecting Warsaw and Poznań with Dresden ran through the town in the 18th century and King Augustus III of Poland often traveled that route.

Following the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the town was occupied by Germany until 1945. A local Polish teacher was among the victims of a massacre of Poles, committed by the Germans in Konin on 10 November 1939 as part of the Intelligenzaktion.

908,24676,5318329,83156,Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport,"Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport  is the main international airport serving the city of Chongqing in Southwestern China. It is located in Yubei, Chongqing, about  north of the Chongqing urban center.

The airport is a major aviation hub for airlines in western China, including China Express Airlines, China Southern Airlines (Chongqing Airlines), Sichuan Airlines, Shandong Airlines, XiamenAir and West Air. Chongqing is a focus city of Air China and Hainan Airlines.

Jiangbei Airport has undergone multiple major expansions. The latest expansion involves a new terminal 3B and a fourth runway currently under construction as of 2023. The first, second, and third phases of the airport came into operation in January 1990, December 2004, and December 2010, respectively. Terminal 2 is capable of handling 15 million passengers and Terminal 3A 45 million passengers annually.

It was the second-busiest airport in Mainland China by passenger traffic in 2022, and the sixth-busiest as of 2023. Jiangbei Airport was awarded the best airport in its size category by Airports Council International in 2017 and again in 2018.

History
The civil aviation of Chongqing dates back to the 1920s. After the completion of Baishiyi Airport in 1938, Chongqing became one of the four cities in China that had an airport in operation. In 1950, four flight routes from Tianjin, Chengdu, Guangzhou and Kunming to Chongqing became the earliest to be opened after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949. In 1965, the Civil Aviation Administration of China opened an office in Sichuan Province and Chongqing Airport became subject to it. The development of Chongqing's civil aviation then stopped until the 1990s.

On 22 January 1990, the new airport, Chongqing Jiangbei Airport was opened to replace the old Baishiyi Airport's commercial flight functions, which remained open as a military airport. The development of the civil aviation resumed. In 1997, when the Chongqing area became a 4th municipality of China, Civil Aviation Administration of China established a branch in Chongqing in the same year.

 Terminals 
Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport contains three terminals: Terminal 1 (currently closed), Terminal 2A and 2B (domestic services), and Terminal 3A (domestic and international services). Terminals 1 and 2 are situated along the western perimeter of the airport, while the larger, newer Terminal 3A is located farther southeast of the former two. CRT line 10 and free terminal shuttle bus provide services between Terminal 2 and 3A.

 Terminal 1 was the original passenger terminal building when Jiangbei Airport was first opened in 1990. It handled international services until its closure in August 2017.
 Terminal 2 contains two concourses (hence 2A and 2B). Concourse A was opened in 2004 and Concourse B in 2010. The terminal has 30 gates and annual passenger capacity of 37 million. It currently handles domestic services. It offers concourse access to CRT Terminal 2 of Jiangbei Airport Station which is serviced by CRT line 3 and 10.
 Terminal 3A was opened in August 2017. The terminal is the largest of the three and has 66 gates. It has annual passenger capacity of 45 million. It currently handles domestic services and all international services. It offers concourse access to CRT Terminal 3 of Jiangbei Airport Station which is serviced by CRT line 10.
 Terminal 3B is currently under construction as part of the fifth phase expansion project of the airport. Construction is projected to complete in 2024.

Development
Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport is currently undergoing a major expansion, with a vision of obtaining a major international air hub and becoming the largest airport in western China by 2030.  Jiangbei Airport has been outlined ambitious growth plans, competing with Chengdu Airport, Kunming Airport, Wuhan Airport and Xi'an Airport to be recognized as the nation's fourth largest aviation hub (after those hubs in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou).

Jiangbei Airport was reported to have reached the fastest growth rates since 2011, according to CAPA's Airport Traffic Benchmark Tool. On 1 November 2015, the annual passengers at Jiangbei Airport exceeded 30 million for the first time.

Airport expansion
The expansion project Phase III, which included a second runway and an additional Terminal, T2, started construction in 2007 and completed in 2010. Major elements of the construction were adding a second runway of  (which was later lengthened to  to satisfy the landings and takeoffs of Boeing 747 and the demands of Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P.) to the east of the existing runway, building a parallel taxiway in between the two runways, and setting up a visual aid lighting support system. It also added a second terminal building (T2) with an area of , 41 apron aircraft parking stands, and a freight station and support facilities occupying an area of . It cost CNY3.3 billion (US$538 million). On 22 December 2010, the second runway was commissioned, which made Jiangbei Airport the fourth airport in mainland China to operate two runways, one exclusively for departures and the other exclusively for arrivals.

The most recent expansion - Phase IV (dubbed the Eastern Expansion) - of Jiangbei Airport has been the biggest and contains the construction of a third runway and a new terminal, T3A, being , more than double the size of the existing terminals (T1 and T2A/T2B) combined, costing CNY26.0 billion (US$4.1 billion). Most of T3A's construction work was completed by the end of 2016. The terminal was inaugurated in August 2017, after which the airport has more than  of terminal floor space, ranking Jiangbei Airport among China's 15 largest airports with an annual passenger capacity of 60 million and an annual cargo capacity of 2 million tons.  Half of the terminal (concourses G & H) is for international flights from major cities in South East Asia, East Asia, Middle East, Africa, Europe, and North America. After the completion of expansion Phase IV, Jiangbei Airport became the fourth airport in Greater China (inc. Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan) that has three runways in operation, of which Runway #3 (03/21) is operated independently on top of the pair #1 (02L/20R) and #2 (02R/20L).

The fifth phase of expansion for Jiangbei Airport is currently underway. It is expected to include a new terminal, namely T3B and a fourth runway. The satellite terminal is designed by Zaha Hadid Architects and CSWADI, with interior design later updated by Nordic Office of Architecture. The terminal will be connected via underground air-side monorail. This phase will be finished in the mid-2020s.

Note: Remote bays include the ones that serve the air freighters.

Surge in cargo traffic

Cargo traffic increased at an average rate of 14% in the first six months of 2011, driven by exponential growth in international cargo. International cargo/mail volumes increased by 12 times from 2010 levels in the first half of 2011, to more than 9000 tonnes. In the second half of 2011, this growth rate is expected to be maintained, with Hewlett-Packard, Asus and other brands of large international IT production capacity supporting the increase, to an anticipated 60,000 to 80,000 tonnes of international cargo throughout the whole year.

New international routes

Before 2010, Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport's international destinations all terminated in East and Southeast Asia, including direct flights to Tokyo (has stop-over in Beijing or Shanghai), Seoul, Singapore, Bangkok, Phuket, Siem Reap, etc. In 2011, Qatar Airways opened a new route to Doha. Finnair’s services to Helsinki would later be added in 2012. 

With the new T3A terminal in operation since August 2017, the airport has had multiple new international routes with non-stop flights to London, Dubai, Los Angeles, New York, Sydney, Melbourne, Rome, Paris, Budapest, etc. 
T3A Terminal and the third runway of Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport started operation at 06:00 on 29 August 2017. In the meantime, T1 was temporarily closed, T2 serve only domestic flights operated by Sichuan Airlines, West Airlines, Huaxia Airlines and Spring Airlines, and the remaining flights were transferred to T3A.  In addition, the airport operates a free trans-shipment shuttle between T2 and T3A in a 24-hour operation.

Freeways and roads

There is currently one airport freeway connecting the city center with the airport, and the second one is under construction and will be put into operation in the late 2016. The airport freeway is 23 kilometers long, but it usually takes as many as 30 minutes to get from the city center to the airport because of the heavy traffic.

 Parking 
The airport has four parking lots:

 International (Outdoor) Parking Lot, located in front of Terminal 1 (with certain sections transformed into a drive-in cinema since March 2022)
 Domestic (Outdoor) Parking Lot, located in front of Terminal 2
 Underground (Indoor) Parking Lot, located under Terminal 2
 Central Parking Garage, located in the GTC (Ground Transportation Center) in front of Terminal 3

All together, the airport can accommodate about 7,300 cars at one time.

Chongqing Rail Transit (CRT)

Chongqing Rail Transit Line 3 runs from Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport's Terminal 2 station, going through the city center via Lianglukou station and onto its final stop, Yudong, covering a distance of . It takes around 50 minutes to get to the city center (Lianglukou).

Line 10, serves as the second metro line connecting the urban areas of Chongqing and the airport.http://cq.people.com.cn/n2/2017/0828/c365402-30660695.html| Terminal 3 accessible by CRT Line 10(Source in Chinese). Retrieved 18 June 2018 One station of Line 10 is at Terminal 3 and the other is at Terminal 2. This line runs under Runways #1 (02L/20R) and #2 (02R/20L), connecting Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 in landside. Line 10 is the only metro line access to the new Terminal 3, while Line 3 will not be elongated to Terminal 3. Line 10 also reduces the travel distance between Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport and Chongqingbei Railway Station, which can facilitate the transfers of passengers between air and rail.

 National Railway and Intercity Trains 

China Railway (Intercity trains)
Terminal 3A has a large underground railway station as part of its GTC (Ground Transportation Center). It is adjacent to the Chongqing Rail Transit Line 10 metro station. The railway station opened on 30 December 2022, initially with limited service to stations along the Chongqing Railway Hub East Ring line, forming the Airport Branch of the railway line. It is one stop away from Chongqing North railway station, a major railway station servicing Chongqing.

The station is designed to connect cities as far as 300 kilometers away, thus allowing Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport to serve a significantly larger population. The speed of the trains is designed to be 250 to 300 kilometers per hour, allowing journeys to take less than one hour from a relatively faraway locations within the Chongqing Municipality.

Other facilities
The headquarters of China Express Airlines are on the airport property.

HSReps members across the country engage in political activity and work on political campaigns.

 History 
The High School Republican National Federation was established as a student-led organization in April 2022 to provide greater coordination and support for local high school Republican groups. It was founded through a convention of state federations, each of which was an existing auxiliary of its respective state party. Their mission statement is to ""fight the ideological battle in schools, work hard to contact voters to elect Republicans, and organize for a strong future."" Although certain HSReps chapters are styled as 'Teen Republicans,' some still operate under the National Federation.

 Organization 
The High School Republican National Federation has state and local chapters nationwide. The largest chapter is in Texas with over 1,000 active members. The national organization presides over High School Republicans as a whole. It is led by the National Board, which consists of a chairman, co-chairman, regional vice chairmen, secretary, and appointed directors. The National Board is responsible for overseeing and growing the organization to promote Republican causes. Leadership also includes a National Committee consisting of representatives from each state.

Local chapters at high schools and counties work at a grassroots level to rally young people behind causes. Local High School Republican chapters have organized candidate forums, held voter registration drives, and helped to elect Republicans in their communities.

 Involvement 
During election season, High School Republicans utilize door-to-door canvassing, phone banking, and word of mouth to reach voters on behalf of Republican campaigns. These students have assisted on several campaigns, including those for Congressman Don Bacon, Heidi Ganahl, and several others.

High School Republicans also engage in legislative activism in their state chapters. In December 2023, New Jersey High School Republicans members testified in Trenton, New Jersey, to support the Involve Our Youth Act, a bill to give high school students excused absences for engaging in civic activities. They partnered with the New Jersey High School Democrats to get the bill passed.",2025-03-22,"['Republican Party (United States) organizations'

Background
Shortly after the Barons' Crusade of Theobald I of Navarre, Ascalon's walls were repaired, and after the Battle of Forbie, some of the crusaders escaped to Ascalon. Shortly after a civil war between As-Salih Ayyub and Al-Salih Ismail, which ended in Ayyub's victory and the consolidation of Damascus under his control, Ayyub now gave his attention to the Crusaders. On June 17, 1247, Tiberias was captured, and soon afterwards, Mount Tabor and Belvoir fell to the Ayyubids. The Muslims then marched towards Ascalon.

Siege
The Ascalon fortifications were in good position and had a strong garrison of knights Hospitallers. The Hospitallers called for aid from Cyprus and Acre. Henry I of Cyprus sent a fleet of 8 galleys and 100 knights and went to Acre, where they joined the navy assembled at Acre and headed towards Ascalon. The Ayyubid assembled a fleet of 21 galleys who were blockading Ascalon, sailed to meet the Crusader navy, but before any engagement happens, a storm ran into the fleet and wrecked many of the Muslim ships. The survivors sailed back to Egypt.

The Crusader navy managed to reach Ascalon unharmed and supply the garrison with men and food. However, the bad weather forced the Crusader navy to set sail for Acre, leaving Ascalon to its fate. The Ayyubids had no siege equipment, but the wreckage of their fleet provided them with wood to construct siege weapons. They built a battering ram and forced its way to the walls. On October 15, they managed to enter the castle using a tunnel. The Crusaders were taken by surprise. The majority of the crusaders were killed, and the rest were taken prisoners.

Aftermath
Ayyub ordered Ascalon to be demolished and left desolate. Ayyub chose not to follow up with his victory. He went to Jerusalem, repaired its walls, and headed to Damascus to spend the winter there.",2024-11-23,"['Sieges involving the Ayyubid Sultanate'

917,15969,5295849,10863,"Latchford, Ontario","Latchford is a single-tier municipality town in Timiskaming District in Northeastern Ontario, Canada. It is located on Bay Lake on the Montreal River, near the town of Cobalt and the municipality of Temagami, and is 20 kilometres (13 miles) from the city of Temiskaming Shores. The population of the town in the Canada 2011 Census was 387, which makes it the smallest town by population in Ontario. The town's slogan is ""The Best Little Town by a Dam Site!""

History
Latchford was first settled in 1902 when the decision to build the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway (now the Ontario Northland Railway) was struck. It was decided the railway would cross the Montreal River at the location of what is today Latchford, and a bridge was finished in 1904. Hence, the settlement was known first as Montreal River Station. It was renamed Latchford in 1905 in honour of the provincial commissioner of public works, Francis Robert Latchford, and was incorporated as a town on July 15, 1907. A dam that provided hydroelectric power, as well as a vehicle crossing over the river, was built in 1910, and Ontario Highway 11 including a bridge over the river was built finished through the town in 1927. Silver mining, forestry, and later tourism, drove Latchford’s economy throughout the 20th century.

In 2006, the boundaries of the town were expanded to include the South Part of geographic Gillies Limit Township.

A plaque was erected in 2009 commemorating the founding of the town.

Transportation
Latchford has good road links because of Ontario Highway 11, which is part of the Trans-Canada Highway as it passes through the town. Ontario Northland offers a twice-daily bus service north towards Cochrane and south towards North Bay.

Bridges
The Sgt. Aubrey Cosens VC Memorial Bridge, which carries Ontario Highway 11, is the town's most recognized symbol. It was named after a World War II recipient of the Victoria Cross from Latchford. The bridge failed on a cold day in 2003, but was repaired and is again in service.

Recreation
W.J.B. Greenwood Provincial Park is in Latchford south of the town centre.

It flows from the hills of Karauli district and enters the south-western border of Bayana Tehsil from the Karauli side. Its waters are held up in the Baretha reservoir, which is the largest storage of water in the region.

 History 
The construction of Baretha Bund, which spans the Kakund River, was commenced in 1866 and completed in 1897. This bund plays a crucial role in water management and irrigation.

926,36150,5351264,12390,Downsend School,"Downsend School is a co-educational independent school for pupils aged between six months and sixteen. In 2020, Downsend became a through-school, offering a three-year GCSE. It is located in Leatherhead, Ashtead and Epsom, in Surrey, UK.

It is a school for boys and girls, and takes on pupils from 6 months to 16 years of age across its four schools in Ashtead, Epsom and Leatherhead. Unusually the school does not have charitable status, being run as a profitable business by Cognita Schools Limited. Downsend's headmaster is Mr Ian Thorpe, previously head of Chinthurst School.

History
Downsend was founded, owned for nearly a century, and headmastered by three generations of the Linford family. A. H. Linford had started Peterborough Lodge, a preparatory school for about 100 boys aged 5 to 15, including 5 to 10 boarders, at 143 Finchley Road, Hampstead, about 1898. During the First World War he opened Downsend for the boarders from Peterborough Lodge, and in 1940 after the beginning of the Second World War the two schools amalgamated at the Downsend site between Leatherhead and Ashtead. A. H. Linford's son Cedric T. Linford became headmaster.

For about a year from 1942 the boarders were taken out of the London area to Hurstpierpoint College in Sussex, where they were under the control of the mathematics master, Denys Straker. C. T. Linford remained headmaster, also teaching Latin and Greek, until his son Christopher J. Linford took over in 1968. The school was run as a non-denominational preparatory school for boys aged 8 to 13. It achieved a good record for scholarships to leading public schools, especially during the long period when Denys Straker was the mathematics master. In 1968 the school had 220 boys; Christopher Linford expanded the business to four schools in the area educating a total of around 900 boys and girls. In 2002 no one in the family was willing to take on the heavy responsibility of running the school and it was sold to Asquith Court Schools Ltd.

The school
Downsend is situated at 1 Leatherhead Road, Leatherhead, Surrey KT22 8TJ, just outside Ashtead. Three Little Downsend Nursery and Pre-preps are located in Epsom, Leatherhead and Ashtead, all surrounding the main site. The structure of the school is as follows: Little Downsend Ashtead caters for children aged 6 months to 4 years. Little Downsend Epsom and Leatherhead educate children from the age of 2 (First Steps) to age 7 (Year 2). The Main School in Leatherhead educates children from Year 3 to Year 11.

Facilities
There is a sports hall and an adjacent indoor, heated swimming pool with multiple changing rooms. There are a total of six tennis courts on tarmac surfaces, and a covered area. On 12 May 2007 the local Member of Parliament, Chris Grayling, opened the new Astro Turf. The junior and senior schools are all separate but connected. The junior school has its own hall and library and headmistress. This is the same with the senior school.

Sport
Downsend has grass playing fields and an astro-turf one located on site. This was opened to pupils in 2007. The school has several rugby, football, cricket, and rounders pitches. The tarmac area can be converted into tennis courts, netball pitches, basketball courts, or hockey pitches (although hockey is generally on the astro). The sports hall can be used for basketball as it has several hoops and pitches. Badminton can be played in the hall as can gymnastics and volleyball. Inside the hall, there are four cricket nets. The school has sports teams in soccer, rugby, netball, cricket, rounders, basketball, athletics, swimming, and hockey. These teams compete in inter-school matches as well as school games.

The school competed regularly in the National Biathlon Championships, in 2012 held at Crystal Palace and, in 2012, maintained its record of seven national titles in a row.

Little Downsend Schools (Epsom, Ashtead and Leatherhead)
The three Little Downsend Schools are located around the main site in the towns of Leatherhead, Ashtead and Epsom. They take children from 6 months to 7 years of age and pupils can automatically transfer up to the main school. Little Downsend has its own headmistress and Heads of School.

The race was originally scheduled to be held on Sunday, August 9, 1987, but was delayed until Monday, August 10, due to heavy rain.  The race was held before an audience of 35,000 in Watkins Glen, New York, at the shortened layout of Watkins Glen International, a  permanent road course layout.

By race's end, Blue Max Racing's Rusty Wallace, managing to retain the lead after a last-lap pit stop, dominated a majority of the race to take his third career NASCAR Winston Cup Series victory and his first victory of the season.   To fill out the top three, Junior Johnson & Associates' Terry Labonte and owner-driver Dave Marcis finished second and third, respectively.

 Background 

Watkins Glen International (nicknamed ""The Glen"") is an automobile race track located in Watkins Glen, New York at the southern tip of Seneca Lake. It was long known around the world as the home of the Formula One United States Grand Prix, which it hosted for twenty consecutive years (1961–1980), but the site has been home to road racing of nearly every class, including the World Sportscar Championship, Trans-Am, Can-Am, NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, the International Motor Sports Association and the IndyCar Series.

Initially, public roads in the village were used for the race course. In 1956 a permanent circuit for the race was built. In 1968 the race was extended to six hours, becoming the 6 Hours of Watkins Glen. The circuit's current layout has more or less been the same since 1971, although a chicane was installed at the uphill Esses in 1975 to slow cars through these corners, where there was a fatality during practice at the 1973 United States Grand Prix. The chicane was removed in 1985, but another chicane called the ""Inner Loop"" was installed in 1992 after J.D. McDuffie's fatal accident during the previous year's NASCAR Winston Cup event.

The circuit is known as the Mecca of North American road racing and is a very popular venue among fans and drivers. The facility is currently owned by International Speedway Corporation.

938,49813,76416458,71152,2020 Northern Pride RLFC season,"2020 was the thirteenth competitive season for the Cairns based Kenfrost Homes Northern Pride Rugby League Football Club. They were one of 14 clubs that competed in the twenty-fifth season of Queensland's top rugby league competition, QRL's Hostplus Cup. The Northern Pride were due to play 12 home games and 11 away games over 23 rounds between March and August, but the season was cancelled after Round One due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Before the season was cancelled, the Pride played three pre-season trials, two of which attracted large crowds - the trial against the Blackhawks was a curtain-raiser to the NRL Cowboys v Broncos pre-season trial, and the Pride's trial against the Hunters attracted a large ex-pat following.

Coach Ty Williams named a new six-man 'leadership group' composed of Javid Bowen, Rod Griffin, Matolu Laumea, Patrick Gallen, Tom McGrath, and new recruit Josh Stuckey. From this group Williams chose Javid Bowen as captain , and Rod Griffin as vice-captain.

A new three-year naming rights sponsor, Kenfrost Homes was announced in December 2019. The Pride had been without a major sponsor since the Sea Swift sponsorship ended in 2017. The Pride are one of five QCup sides that do not have the financial backing of a major leagues club.

Before Round One, the QRL adopted the NRL's COVID-19 guidelines, which included a 'no fans' policy, meaning the games would be played before empty grandstands.

On 17 March, two days after the completion of Round One, QRL announced the competition would be suspended for ten weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic.https://www.qrl.com.au/news/2020/05/18/qrl-coronavirus-updates/ It was hoped QCup would resume with Round 12 in June, but the rapidly deteriorating situation with the pandemic meant on 26 March the Queensland Government announced Stage 1 Restrictions on movements across the Queensland border, which would affect NSW club Tweed Heads Seagulls, PNG club SP Hunters, and the feeder arrangements that Easts Tigers and SC Falcons had with the Melbourne Storm and the Ipswich Jets had with Newcastle Knights. Consequently, the next day QRL cancelled the competition for the 2020 season. QRL managing director Robert Moore stated, ""by making this announcement now, it provides our clubs with the opportunity to re-set and turn their attention towards the 2021 season"". The Pride reduced to a staff of three, with the CEO, Coach and Commercial Manager Alannah Giuffrida retained on reduced wages. Many of the Pride's New Zealand players returned home before the NZ border closed.

In the absence of football, the Cairns Post ran a series ranking the top fifty Northern Pride players from the last 12 seasons.

As the year progressed, there was talk of staging some games, with the Pride, Blackhawks, Cutters and CQ Capras playing a Northern Championship, but travel costs were prohibitive and the idea was abandoned.

In August the 'Kenfrost Homes Lightning Challenge' was held between two CDRL clubs (Brothers Cairns and Tully Tigers), and two teams from the Pride. The Pride combined their ISC side with their HDC U-20s side to make the 'Pride Giants' and 'Pride Reef Kings'. Games were played in Cairns and Tully over six rounds. Pride coach Ty Williams took a back seat, leaving the coaching to Bevan Walker, Pride's ISC assistant coach, and Dave Scott, Pride's HDC U-20 coach. Controversially, two of Brothers Cairns games were abandoned when match officials were abused. The 'Pride Reef Kings' were undefeated and won the competition.

At the end of the season, Northern Pride football operations manager Chey Bird resigned. CEO Tony Williamson also resigned.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) considers this corridor to be essential for carrying out raids in northern and central Gaza, as well as securely channeling aid into the region. The corridor was run by IDF divisions that rotated in and out of it, particularly the 99th Division and 252nd Division.

Following a ceasefire with Hamas that came into effect on 19 January 2025, Israel withdrew from parts of the Netzarim Corridor on 27 January. Israel completely withdrew its troops from the corridor on 9 February 2025. Large crowds of displaced Gazans were then able to cross through and return to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip. However, the IDF returned to the Corridor on 19 March after the ceasefire broke down.

 Background 
Netzarim was an Israeli settlement in the Gaza Strip which was built in 1972 and dismantled in 2005 during the Israeli disengagement from the territory. The IDF captured the site of the former settlement during the 2008-2009 Gaza War, which ended with a ceasefire and Israeli withdrawal from the Strip.

The IDF named the present corridor after Netzarim, since it includes the site of the former settlement.Celine Alkhaldi, Allegra Goodwin and Richard Allen Greene ""Israeli road splitting Gaza in two has reached the Mediterranean coast, satellite imagery shows"" CNN March 8, 2024

History

 Invasion of the Gaza Strip 

Israel invaded the Gaza strip on 27 October 2023 as a response to the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel three weeks prior. On 30 October 2023, IDF troops were confirmed to have entered the area of the former Netzarim settlement. By 6 November, the IDF ""had cut an informal, winding track"" across the Gaza Strip which reached to the coast. On 24 November, it was reported that the IDF would ""continue administrative and logistical movements on the Netzarim axis and coastal road in the northern Gaza Strip"".

Satellite imagery from 6 March 2024 showed that a  long partially paved road, numbered Route 749,  had been constructed within the corridor. Approximately  of the road consists of pavement that existed prior to the Gaza war, with Israel clearing a path through the entire width of the strip. The IDF also repaired portions that were destroyed by armored vehicles and reinforced it with multiple lanes for various types of military vehicles. Satellite imagery from 24 May 2024 showed new pavement had been laid over gravel roads since 18 May 2024 up to the intersection with the Salah al-Din Road.

According to the Institute for the Study of War, in July 2024 Israel increased the width of the corridor from  to .

On 17 August 2024, two Israeli soldiers of the Jerusalem Brigade's 8119th Battalion were killed in the Netzarim Corridor by a Hamas ambush which included a roadside bomb and militants firing on the convoy.

Iran claimed that it successfully hit the Netzarim Corridor as part of its October 2024 Iranian airstrikes on Israel. The claim has not been confirmed by Israel nor any Western analyst.

Between September and November 2024, Israeli soldiers demolished over 600 buildings around the road to create a buffer zone, in addition to increasing the presence of outposts, communication towers, and defensive fortifications.

On 18 December 2024, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz published the testimonies of commanders and officers of the 252nd Division and the 99th Division about the Netzarim Corridor being a ""kill zone"" with arbitrary lines where every Palestinian is shot for being a suspected terrorist. One officer claimed that a report of 200 killed Hamas militants was wrong since ""of those 200 casualties, only ten were confirmed as known Hamas operatives"".

 Ceasefire 

As part of a ceasefire agreement with Hamas that came into effect on 19 January 2025, Israel agreed to gradually withdraw from the Netzarim Corridor.

On 25 January, Hamas failed to release a hostage scheduled for transfer to Israel under the ceasefire's prisoner exchange. As a result, Israel suspended its planned opening up of the Netzarim Corridor. However, the release of the hostage was later arranged and Israel opened up the western part of the corridor on the morning of 27 January, with large crowds of displaced Gazans returning to the north. The IDF also began withdrawing from the part that was opened. American and Egyptian security contractors, working under an Egyptian-Qatari committee tasked with implementing the ceasefire, began inspecting vehicles moving through the area. Hamas militants were also later seen stationed at the Netzarim Corridor. On 9 February 2025, Israel fully withdrew its troops from the Netzarim Corridor.

 Resumption of hostilities 
On 18 March, the security contractors left the corridor before dawn, when the IDF initiated a ""focused ground operation"" in central Gaza with the intention of creating a ""partial buffer zone"" and to re-take the Netzarim Corridor bisecting the Gaza Strip, after launching attacks across Gaza, killing over 400 and ending the ceasefire.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/19/israel-launches-limited-ground-operation-to-retake-netzarim-corridor-in-gaza On March 19, Israeli forces returned and recaptured the central part of the corridor.",2025-04-12,"['Buildings and structures in the Gaza Strip'

942,17783,75501293,121995,List of acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1806,"This is a complete list of acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for the year 1806.

Note that the first parliament of the United Kingdom was held in 1801; parliaments between 1707 and 1800 were either parliaments of Great Britain or of Ireland).  For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.

For acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.

The number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as ""39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67"", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus ""41 Geo. 3"" rather than ""41 Geo. III""). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as ""41 Geo. 3"".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.

All modern acts have a short title, e.g. ""the Local Government Act 2003"".  Some earlier acts also have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.

46 Geo. 3

The fourth session of the 2nd Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 21 January 1806 until 23 July 1806.

946,30718,75850208,40078,Next Cypriot legislative election,"The next Cypriot legislative elections are expected to be held in May 2026, to elect 56 of the 80 members of the House of Representatives. The elections could be held earlier if parliament is dissolved before it reaches the end of its five-year term.

Electoral system
The 80 members of the House of Representatives are elected from six multi-member constituencies which corresponds to the six districts of Cyprus, with the number of seats allocated according to the population of each area. Of the 80, 56 are elected by Greek Cypriots and 24 by Turkish Cypriots. However, since 1963 the Turkish Cypriot seats have been unfilled, and the House of Representatives has de facto had 56 seats since its enlargement in the 1980s.

The elections are held using open list proportional representation; voters vote for a party and can then cast one preferential vote for a candidate on their party's list for every four seats available in their constituency (party leaders or other candidates heading coalitions are not required to receive preferential votes to be elected). Seats are allocated using the Hare quota, with any remaining seats allocated to lists that won at least one seat or parties that received at least 3.6% of the vote. The seat allocations for the 2021 election were as follows:

 Parliamentary parties 

 Democratic Rally (DISY) 
The centre-right Democratic Rally (DISY) is currently the largest political party in Cyprus, holding 17 of the 56 seats in the House of Representatives. Following its defeat in the 2023 presidential election and internal divisions resulting from the independent candidacy of former DISY member Nikos Christodoulides, the party’s stance as the official opposition has been perceived as ambiguous. Several of Christodoulides' ministers are active DISY members, and on occasions, such as the 2024 National Budget, DISY made fewer amendments to the President's proposal compared to the governing parties. This perceived lack of opposition has contributed to public dissatisfaction with DISY’s role in countering the Christodoulides administration, which has faced increasing unpopularity.

During the candidate selection process for the 2024 European Parliament Election, DISY’s internal elections resulted in one of the then-vice presidents, Marios Pelekanos, finishing second to last, excluding him from the six-candidate ballot. Dissatisfied with the outcome, Pelekanos resigned from his leadership position, citing a series of incidents that, according to him, undermined his standing within the party. On March 22, 2024, it was announced, following multi-day discussions with the National Popular Front (ELAM), that Pelekanos would be running in the European elections under ELAM's banner. This decision was condemned by DISY leader Annita Demetriou, who emphasised the ideological differences between the two parties. DISY subsequently removed Pelekanos from its membership registry. Pelekanos, who had also served as the government spokesperson during the DISY-backed Anastasiades' administration (2021–2023), ultimately became ELAM's Press Representative. Despite DISY securing a first-place finish in the European elections, their 24.8% share of the vote marked the worst performance in the party’s history.

DISY continued to face internal challenges after the European elections, notably between Averof Neofytou, the party's former leader and its presidential candidate in 2023, and Nicos Anastasiades, former party leader and President of Cyprus from 2013 to 2023. In a podcast on July 8, 2024, Anastasiades criticised Neofytou’s 2023 presidential campaign, suggesting that it had failed to resonate with DISY supporters, contributing to the party's defeat. He also questioned Neofytou’s alignment with AKEL-backed candidate Andreas Mavroyiannis during the second round of the election, to which Neofytou failed to qualify. Anastasiades' remark that he did not want to ""bother with bitter people,"" directed at Neofytou, prompted a response from Neofytou on social media, stating that the ""bitter"" ones were the thousands who had once trusted Anastasiades, along with broader criticisms of Anastasiades' handling of the Cyprus problem.

Neofytou also clashed with current DISY leader Annita Demetriou over the party’s support for the Great Sea Interconnector, a planned HVDC interconnector between the Greek, Cypriot, and Israeli power grids. The project, primarily developed during the DISY-backed Anastasiades’ presidency, has strong backing from DISY. However, Neofytou expressed strong disagreement about advancing energy projects before resolving the Cyprus problem and questioned whether the interconnection will actually reduce energy bills in Cyprus. This stance put him at odds with Demetriou, who strongly supports the project. In September 2024, when asked about Neofytou's potential candidacy for the 2028 presidential election—following his own expressed interest—Annita Demetriou responded that Neofytou had already been tested in 2023, and in light of the public's verdict, DISY should now move forward for the benefit of the country.

Prominent MPs Averof Neofytou, Efthymios Diplaros, and Harris Georgiades have announced that they will not seek re-election in the upcoming legislative election, in adherence to the party statute's 3-term-limit. However, they intend to remain politically active.

 Progressive Party of Working People (AKEL) 
The Progressive Party of Working People (AKEL), the second-largest party in Cyprus with 15 of the 56 seats in the House of Representatives,  experienced its worst-ever performance in the 2024 European Parliament Election, garnering only 21.5% of the vote and losing one of its two seats for the first time in its history. Despite AKEL’s strong showing in the 2023 presidential election, with candidate Andreas Mavroyiannis surpassing polling expectations, internal tensions have emerged since then.

Irene Charalambidou, a prominent AKEL Member of Parliament, has increasingly distanced herself from the party’s positions, frequently voting independently in the House of Representatives. The rift between Charalambidou and AKEL deepened during the controversy over the dismissal of Odysseas Michaelides, the former Auditor General of Cyprus. Charalambidou is a longstanding supporter of Michaelides due to his efforts against perceived corruption during the Anastasiades administration. The MP is ineligible to run for AKEL in the 2026 legislative elections due to term limits, and there are widespread rumours that she may join a new parliamentary movement led by Michaelides, who has garnered popularity for his anti-corruption stance. An opinion poll conducted by RetailZoom from October 14 to 16, 2024, indicated that a hypothetical new party led by Odysseas Michaelides would secure second place in the next legislative election, receiving 21% of the vote.

AKEL rebranded itself as ""AKEL - Social Alliance"" for the 2024 European Parliament Election, following a merger with several smaller left-leaning parties. The party intends to keep this structure for the next legislative election, with its parliamentary candidates ranging from the political center to the traditional left.

 National People's Front (ELAM) 
The far-right party ELAM is expected to strengthen its presence in the House of Representatives, with opinion polls projecting a third-place finish, surpassing for the first time the centrist Democratic Party. Once considered a fringe movement, over the last few years ELAM has gained increasing support from mainstream right-wing voters. Notably, former DISY vice-president Marios Pelekanos was appointed as ELAM's Press Representative, signaling broader appeal beyond its traditional base.

In January 2025, independent MP Andreas Themistokleous, who was previously elected with ELAM but later expelled for ""inappropriate behavior,"" announced the formation of a new political party named the Democratic National Movement. The new party espouses a platform emphasizing religious conservatism, nationalism, and strong opposition to progressive social policies (""anti-woke""). It is anticipated to attract support from traditional ELAM voters, potentially impacting ELAM's projected growth.

947,58918,76698794,9746,Noah Sebastian,"Noah Sebastian (born October 31, 1995) is an American singer best known as the lead singer of the metalcore band Bad Omens. He is also the group's main songwriter and producer alongside guitarist Joakim Karlsson.

Career
At age 12, Noah Sebastian joined an Enter Shikari cover band. Inspired by the bands The Plot in You and Beartooth, at the age of 16 he began learning how to produce and compose music. In 2013, he left the band he played as a guitarist in Washington, D.C. and formed Man Vs. Self, later renamed Bad Omens. After listening to a demo tape, Sumerian Records offered the group a contract and Sebastian recruited a full lineup for the band. After the release of the singles ""Glass Houses"" and ""Exit Wounds"", the group went on their first tour in 2016. Their follow-up single, ""The Worst in Me"", reached one million streams shortly after its release.

In June 2023, the singer participated in the Artist Friendly podcast along with Joel Madden. In October, Bad Omens had to cancel live performances due to Sebastian's health problems. On Bad Omens' joint tour with Bring Me the Horizon in 2024, he joined the stage during their show to sing ""Antivist"" with Oliver Sykes. In January 2024, Bad Omens released the single ""V.A.N"" in collaboration with singer Poppy; the vocals were performed solely by her.

Musical style and composition
Sebastian wrote Bad Omens' biggest hit ""Just Pretend"", which went viral and was certified Platinum by the RIAA, and also directed its music video. He said that the song was originally written in a satirical way to fit the formula of a song that would be successful – which is what happened. However, the vocals pleased him, and Bad Omens tweaked the song to suit the band.

In an interview with Kerrang! magazine, he stated that he produces music based on what he likes, not what is successful and that he seeks to create music that is different from other bands. For NME, the self-taught singer said he strove to improve his vocal skills during the COVID-19 pandemic, and because of this, The Death of Peace of Mind was produced around vocals. Sebastian 
is tenor.

Bad Omens' self-titled album was widely compared to Bring Me the Horizon's Sempiternal, and Sebastian said that in fact the band was one of his biggest inspirations.

Personal life
Sebastian grew up in Richmond, Virginia with his family consisting of his mother and grandparents. At age 15, he stopped attending school and left home, moving in with friends.

He told Crunchyroll that he usually watches anime; as a child, he watched Naruto and became a fan of the series. He also mentioned Elfen Lied as one of his favorites. When asked how this influenced his music, he said that in ""Suffocate"", a collaboration with EDM artist Kayzo, he used a quote from Naruto.

It has few variants, appearing more mythological than is common for fairy tales.Jacobs, Joseph. More English Fairy Tales, ""The Buried Moon"" It was collected by Marie Clothilde Balfour from the North Lincolnshire Carrs in the Ancholme Valley; its unusual characteristics made many people doubt its origins as a fairy tale. However, when Mrs. Balfour published her notes,Balfour, M. C. (June 1891). ""Legends Of The Cars"". Folk-Lore Vol II, No II, pp. 157-165 they were generally found reliable.Katharine Briggs, An Encyclopedia of Fairies, ""The Dead Moon"" (Pantheon Books, 1976) p. 91.  The story may evidence a form of moon worship.Briggs, K. M. The Fairies in English Tradition and Literature, University of Chicago Press, London, 1967, p. 45. It is catalogued as ATU 1336.

Synopsis

Once upon a time, the Carland was filled with bogs. When the moon shone, it was as safe to walk in as by day, but when she did not, evil things, such as bogies, came out.

One day the moon, hearing of this, pulled on a black cloak over her yellow hair and went to see for herself. She fell into a pool, and a snag bound her there. She saw a man coming toward the pool and fought to be free until the hood fell off; the light helped the man make his way to safety and scared off the evil creatures. She struggled to follow until the hood fell back over her hair, and all the evil things came out of the darkness, trapping her under a big stone with a will-o'-the-wyke to sit on the cross-shaped snag and keep watch.

The moon stopped rising, and the people have been wondering what had happened, until the man saved by the moon told what he had seen. A wise woman sent them into the bog until they found a coffin (the stone), a candle (the will-o'-the-wyke), and a cross (the snag); the moon would be nearby. They did as the wise woman said, and freed the moon. From this time on the moon has shone brighter over the boglands than anywhere else, and the evil things were chased from the Carland.

Modern adaptions

 Charles de Lint retold this as ""The Moon Is Drowning While I Sleep"". 
 The webcomic No Rest for the Wicked uses several elements of the tale as initiating events of the story; the main character is an insomniac princess on a quest to find the missing moon.
 French power metal band Wildpath did a musical adaptation of the tale on their album Underneath. A music video for the song, Buried Moon, was released in 2012. wildpathprod. (2012, December 26).

955,29389,75805255,9955,Jessie Dias,"Maria Conceicao Cardozo e Dias (née Cardozo; born 30 May 1946), known professionally as Jessie Dias, is an Indian actress, and singer known for her work in Konkani films, khell tiatr, and tiatr productions.

Early life
Dias, originally named Maria Conceicao Cardozo, was born on 30 May 1946, at JJ Hospital in Bombay which was part of the Bombay Presidency during the time of British India. Her parents, Jose Manuel Cardozo and Robertina Patrocina, raised her alongside two brothers, Bernard and Lucas. Lucas gained recognition as a Konkani playwright. Dias pursued her education at St. Stephen High School in Mumbai, where she cultivated her passion for the performing arts. Tiatr, a form of musical theater, held a special place in her family's heart, particularly her mother's. 
Dias's connection to the tiatr community deepened through her brother Bernard's friendship with Konkani comedian Anthony Mendes. Through this association, Dias forged meaningful relationships with other tiatrists. Furthermore, Bernard often assisted them in stage arrangements and prompting, lending his support to their performances.

Career
Dias embarked on her journey in the Konkani stage during her childhood, making her debut as a young artist in her brother Lucas Cardozo's tiatr production titled Eksuro (Alone). It was during this time that she caught the attention of Francisco de Parra, a seasoned playwright and lyricist who recognized her potential. At the age of ten, Dias was introduced by de Parra in his tiatr Lagmodi Sun, marking the beginning of her acting career. The turning point in Dias's life arrived in 1963 when she was given the opportunity to substitute for a female artist from Bombay in two dramas, Dotor Advogad (Doctor Advocate) and Director Saib, written by Alfred Rose. These productions were on tour in Goa at the time. Dias's talent in both acting and singing came to the forefront during these performances, impressing not only the Goan audiences but also garnering recognition from esteemed senior artists.

Following this breakthrough, Dias's career gained momentum, as she quickly became a sought-after artist by directors such as M. Boyer, C. Alvares, Remmie Colaco, Jacint Vaz, and Robin Vaz. She specialized in portraying tragic roles and excelled in singing duets, particularly alongside C. Alvares. Dias's vocal prowess extended beyond live performances, as she recorded songs for Gramophone Company India and All India Radio. She also contributed her talents to various audio cassettes and embarked on tiatr tours to several Gulf countries. As of 2000, Dias continues to actively participate in the Konkani stage, frequently appearing in tiatrs and non-stop-shows.

Dias has enjoyed a prolific career in the Konkani theater spanning over five decades, collaborating with more than 90 directors. She has made significant contributions to productions such as Prem Kumar's Kakut Naslolo (Merciless), Konnank Mhunnom Maim (Whom do I call Mother?), and Mortikar (Killer), as well as Minguel Rod's Bapul Bhav (Cousin Brother) and Ghorchem Kestanv (Family Feud), Rico Rod's Paichem Vhoddponn (Father's Pride) and Bailek Lagon (Because of Women), Denis Sequeira's Dogui Mhuje Put (My Two Sons), Alfred Rose's Munis ou Denvchar (Human or Devil), Robin Vaz's Shantichem Login (Shanti's wedding), and C Alvares's Bhattkar de Goa (Landlord of Goa) and Mhuji Vonnim (Through Me). Her participation in khell tiatr productions, including A.M. Pacheco's Fator (Stone), Ligorio Fernandes's Orombh ani Xevott, and Anthony San's Darvontto, has also been noteworthy. However, her most notable collaboration in this genre was with Rosario Rodrigues.

Dias has garnered recognition among tiatr enthusiasts for her duets, not only on the Konkani stage but also in recordings, audio cassettes, and CDs. Throughout her extensive career, she has collaborated with artists such as Lawrence de Tiracol, Francis de Parra, C. Alvares, Bab Peter, Souza Ferrao, Robin Vaz, Greg, and Young Mendes. On stage, Dias has portrayed a wide range of roles, embodying characters as daughters, sisters, mothers, and grandmothers. Amongst these roles, her portrayal of a ""Mother"" stands out as her forte, showcasing her talent. This nurturing instinct extends beyond her performances, as Dias is known for her genuine care and affection towards her colleagues, regardless of their seniority. Writer Daniel F de Souza lauds her compassionate nature, emphasizing her support, both professionally and personally, as she readily extends a helping hand to those in need.

958,24840,5319739,10910,T. Graham Brown,"Anthony Graham Brown  (born October 30, 1954), known professionally as T. Graham Brown, is an American country music singer. Active since 1973, Brown has recorded a total of thirteen studio albums, and has charted more than twenty singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. Three of these singles — ""Hell and High Water"" and ""Don't Go to Strangers"" from 1986, and ""Darlene"" from 1988 — reached Number One, and eight more made Top Ten.

In 2024, he achieved one of country music's crowning achievements when he was invited to become a member of the Grand Ole Opry. Prior to his induction, Brown had made over 300 appearances as a guest performer.

Biography
Anthony Graham Brown was born in 1954 in Arabi, Georgia. He first performed in a duo, Dirk & Tony (1973–75) before founding two more bands, ""Reo Diamond"" (1975) and ""T. Graham Brown's Rack of Spam"" (1979). He married his wife Sheila in 1980; they have a son, Acme Geronimo Brown (born 1989).

Musical career
Brown moved to Nashville in 1982 and found work singing advertising jingles for companies such as McDonald's, Disneyland, Budweiser, Coors, Stroh's, Almond Joy, Coca-Cola, Sears, Dodge Trucks, Ford, Hardee's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, The Nashville Network, B.C.Powders, Dr Pepper, Mountain Dew, 7-Up, and Harrah's. He was also the singing narrator in the Taco Bell ""Run For the Border"" television spots. Brown also found work as a songwriter for E.M.I. Publishing before signing to Capitol Records in 1984. He was with Universal Music Group Nashville for 13 years. His first release for the label, ""Drowning in Memories"", peaked at No.39 on the Billboard country chart. The title song of his debut album ""I Tell It Like It Used To Be"" went to No.7, followed by ""I Wish That I Could Hurt That Way Again"" to No.4, giving way to a pair of number ones: ""Hell and High Water"" and ""Don't Go To Strangers"".

Brown's first release for the label, ""Drowning in Memories"", peaked at No. 39 and was never included on an album. Next came the No. 7 ""I Tell It Like It Used to Be"", the first single from his 1986 album of the same name. Counting its title track, this album accounted for four singles: the No. 3 ""I Wish That I Could Hurt That Way Again"" and two straight Number Ones in ""Hell and High Water"" and ""Don't Go to Strangers"".

Brown's second album for the label, Brilliant Conversationalist, followed a year later. Although none of its singles went to Number One, it accounted for three more Top Ten hits in its title track, followed by ""She Couldn't Love Me Anymore"" and ""Last Resort"". A third album, 1988's Come as You Were, produced his third and final Number One in ""Darlene"". Then came the No. 7 title track and No. 30 ""Never Say Never"". In early 1990, he sang guest vocals on the multi-artist charity single ""Tomorrow's World"", as well as Tanya Tucker's single ""Don't Go Out"", from her album Tennessee Woman.

1990 also saw the release of his next album, Bumper to Bumper. This album's lead-off single ""If You Could Only See Me Now"" went Top Ten with a No. 6 peak, but the other singles — the No. 18 ""Moonshadow Road"" and No. 53 ""I'm Sending One Up for You"" — did not fare as well, with the latter being his first single to land outside the Top 40. That same year, he also released an unsuccessful greatest-hits package. His next album, You Can't Take It with You, only accounted for the No. 31 ""With This Ring"" before he exited Capitol in 1991.

Brown did not record another album until 1998's Wine into Water on the Intersound label. This album produced four more singles for him, although the No. 44 title track was the highest-charting single from it. The subject matter of the lyrics of the song surrounded Brown's then ongoing fight against alcoholism. He then released two more independent albums: The Next Right Thing in 2003 and The Present in 2006.

Brown joined Broadway icon Carol Channing for a duet of ""Don't Sit Under The Apple Tree"" on her 2012 album True To The Red, White, and Blue. He also recorded a duet of ""You Are So Beautiful"" with Lulu Roman (of Hee Haw fame) for her 2013 album At Last. In 2012, Brown appeared on a Country/Gospel album

In 2014, Brown again collaborated with producer Mark Carman to produce the Grammy-nominated album, Forever Changed, featuring guest appearances by industry giants Leon Russell, The Oak Ridge Boys, Steve Cropper, Jeff and Sheri Easter, The Booth Brothers, Three Bridges, Jimmy Fortune, Sonya Isaacs, and Jason Crabb. In July 2014 the first single from the album was released on the MCM World Media Label. The song, ""He'll Take Care of You"", was written by well known, award-winning songwriters Dan Penn, Gary Nicholson, and Donnie Fritts.

959,8011,5275748,6078,Bertram Korn,"Bertram Wallace Korn, Sr. (6 October 1918 – 1979) was an American historian and rabbi, who served in the United States Navy Chaplain Corps during World War II. Serving with the US Naval Reserve after the war, in 1975, he was promoted to Rear Admiral in the Chaplain Corps, the first Jewish chaplain to receive flag rank in any of the United States armed forces.

From 1949 to 1979 Korn was Senior Rabbi at Reform Congregation Keneseth Israel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. During this period, he also wrote and published twelve books, primarily about Jewish history in the United States, with several books related to the history of Jews in the South.

Biography
Bertram Wallace Korn was born on in 1918 to Manuel and Blanche (née Bergman) Korn in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He attended the University of Pennsylvania and Cornell University before graduating from the University of Cincinnati in 1936 with a BA in history.

He was determined to be a rabbi and in 1943 he received an M.H.L. degree from the Hebrew Union College–Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati, the center of Reform Judaism in the United States. He was ordained as a Reform rabbi in that city. He returned late for more graduate work, earning a D.H.L. degree from the College-Institute in 1949.

In 1944, Korn enlisted in the United States Navy and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the United States Navy Chaplain Corps. He was assigned to China with the 1st and 6th Marine Divisions. He continued his association through the US Naval Reserve after the war. In 1975, he was promoted to Rear Admiral in the Chaplain Corps, U.S. Naval Reserve, the first Jewish chaplain to receive flag rank in any of the United States armed forces.

After returning to civilian life, from 1949 to his death in 1979, Korn served as the Senior Rabbi at Reform Congregation Keneseth Israel (KI) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1957, under Rabbi Korn's leadership, KI moved from its Broad Street location downtown to a new building at the current address on Old York Road in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania. Many of its members had moved to the suburbs in the postwar transformation of the United States.

Historian
Korn wrote twelve books on American Jewish history, the most famous being American Jewry and the Civil War, (1951). In 1962 he was named visiting professor of American Jewish history at the New York campus of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion; in 1970 he was named to the same position at Dropsie University in Philadelphia. He also served for a period as president of the American Historical Society. Several of his books explored Jewish history in the American South.

961,35951,5348994,59887,Ed the Happy Clown,"Ed the Happy Clown is a graphic novel by Canadian cartoonist Chester Brown.  Its title character is a large-headed, childlike children's clown who undergoes one horrifying affliction after another.  The story is a dark, humorous mix of genres and features scatological humour, sex, body horror, extreme graphic violence, and blasphemous religious imagery.  Central to the plot are a man who cannot stop defecating; the head of a miniature, other-dimensional Ronald Reagan attached to the head of Ed's penis; and a female vampire who seeks revenge on her adulterous lover who had murdered her to escape his sins.

The surreal, largely improvised story began with a series of unrelated short strips that Brown went on to tie into a single narrative.  Brown first serialized it in his comic book Yummy Fur, and the first, incomplete collected edition in 1989, titled Ed the Happy Clown: A Yummy Fur Book.  Shortly after, Brown became unsatisfied with the direction of the serial; he brought it to an abrupt end in the eighteenth issue of Yummy Fur and turned to autobiography.  A second edition titled Ed the Happy Clown: The Definitive Ed Book appeared in 1992 with an altered ending and most of the later parts of the series eliminated.  The contents of this edition were re-serialized with extensive endnotes in 2005–2006 as a nine-issue Ed the Happy Clown series and collected as Ed the Happy Clown: A  in 2012.

The story is seen by many critics as a highlight of the 1980s North American alternative comics scene. It has left an influence on contemporary alternative cartoonists such as Daniel Clowes, Seth, and Dave Sim, and has won a Harvey and other awards.  Canadian film director Bruce McDonald has had the rights since 1991 to make an Ed film, but the project has struggled to find financial backing.

Background

Brown grew up in Châteauguay, Quebec, a Montreal suburb with a large English-speaking minority.  He was an introverted youth attracted to comic books from a young age.  He aimed at a career drawing superhero comics, but was unsuccessful in getting work with Marvel or DC Comics after graduating from high school.  He moved to Toronto and discovered  and the small-press community.

By the early 1980s Marvel and DC had come to dominate comic-book publishing in North America, and comic shops became the main places of purchase, with a clientele of dedicated comics fans.  During this time, a trend towards greater ambition and expressiveness was developing on the fringes, such as Dave Sim's long Cerebus series and the avant-garde graphics magazine Raw in which the serialization of Art Spiegelman's graphic novel Maus appeared.  Brown was to find himself in the alternative comics scene that grew throughout the decade.

Brown was feeling himself in a creatively stagnant period when he came across a book on Surrealism: Wallace Fowlie's The Age of Surrealism (1950).  The book motivated Brown to work on an improvised minicomic series which he called Yummy Fur and self-published from 1983.

Content

Ed suffers one indignity after another as the plot gets grimmer and more surreal.  His bizarre misfortunes include having the tip of his penis replaced by the head of a miniature, talking Ronald Reagan from another universe.  Ed's adventures featured encounters with penis-worshipping pygmies, flesh-eating rats, Martians, Frankenstein's monster, and other characters from traditional genre fiction.  The story unfolds with a black-comedic sensibility topped with Christian symbolism.  Despite his ordeals—being imprisoned for a crime he did not commit, falling in love with a vampire—Ed remains a gentle, childlike innocent, with a Candide-like optimism.  The story has had more than one ending and is a challenge to summarize.

Summary

The children's hospital Ed is about to visit burns down with all the children in it.  A number of apparently unrelated short gag strips appear  before Brown begins to tie the narrative together into one plot.

Ed is imprisoned when he finds hospital janitor Chet Doodley's severed hand and the police assume Ed had taken it.  In the prison, a man is unable to stop defecating and his faeces fill the jail engulfing all, including Ed.  When Ed emerges he finds the head of his penis replaced with the head of a miniature Ronald Reagan from Dimension X—a world much like Ed's but whose people are tiny.  Dimension X has dumped its waste into a trans-dimensional portal, which turns out to be the anus of the man who could not stop defecating.  Reagan's body remains in Dimension X, and the professor who discovered the portal travels to Ed's dimension to find the head, making contact with the authorities of Ed's world.

Chet believes the loss of his hand is due to his unfaithfulness to his wife; as a child his mother read Chet the story of a Saint Justin who cuts off his right hand to avoid sinning, and Chet assumes his lost hand is a like punishment from God.  He tries to atone for it by killing his girlfriend, Josie, in the woods.  Penis-worshipping, rat-eating pygmy cannibals drag the bodies of both Josie and Ed into the sewers.  As they are about to sever Ed's penis, Josie reanimates in time to save him.  The two attempt to escape from the sewers when they are accidentally shot by a mother–daughter team of pygmy hunters.  Josie dies again, and her disembodied spirit learns from the ghost of Chet's sister that she has become a vampire.

The professor from Dimension X and members of the staff of the Adventures in Science TV show find Ed and the President and bring them to the TV studio.  The discovery is big news, and the professor and the President make a TV appearance.  When it is discovered that the people of Dimension X are homosexual or bisexual the professor is put to a violent death, and Ed and the body of Josie are put in confinement.  The studio is invaded by the pygmies when they recognize their ""Penis God"" on television.  Josie's spirit returns to her body, and she and Ed escape and make their way to the hospital where Chet works.  Josie gets her revenge by seducing Chet and killing him before he is able to repent, thus sending him to Hell.

Ed is one of a number of men secretly kidnapped to provide another, Bick Backman, with a penis transplant—a larger one to please his wife.  Out of the lineup of unconscious men, Ed's penis with the President's head on it stands out and is chosen for Backman.  After the operation, Mounties raid the hospital and, finding Reagan, take Backman and leave Ed, who has had a larger penis sewn on in the President's place.  The hospital hands Ed over to Mrs Backman, claiming he is her husband.  Though suspicious, she accepts Ed—and his newly transplanted penis.

Endings

The ending that appeared in Yummy Fur has not appeared in book editions.  In it, Mrs Backman takes Ed home, but her children are not convinced he is their father.  After he spends some time in the house they decide ""he's way better than the other one"".  There is a resemblance between Ed and Mrs Backman, and it is revealed they were twins separated at birth.  While at church, the Backman children are kidnapped by stone aliens and are saved by Frankenstein's monster, who brings them to Washington, D.C. where they find their kidnapped real father.  Josie and Ed's zombie friend rescues the Backmans.  Ed has his clown makeup restored and reverts to his cheerful self.  When he goes to visit Josie, he learns her apartment building has burned down, and she was the only casualty.  Her charred skeleton is brought out, clutching an unburnt severed hand.

The alternate ending from the 1992 and later versions drops most of the story that follows Chet's death,  replacing it with 17 new pages.  In this version, Chet's severed hand visits Josie's apartment at night and rolls up her window shade.  As she is a vampire, the sunlight in the morning burns her to death while she sleeps, and she and Chet are reunited in the flames of Hell.

Primary characters

Analysis

Ed spans a range of Brown's interests, from political skepticism to scatological humour to vampires and werewolves.  The story is dark and surreal, desperate and humorous.

Christian elements especially—largely sacrilegious—are prominent in the book.  They are at first innocuous and unimportant: a zombie named Christian, another character who believes he has found Christ's face on a piece of adhesive tape.  With the fourth issue of Yummy Fur, Brown's surreal take on Christianity becomes central: the cover depicts the Virgin Mary holding not just the infant Christ, but also a severed hand.  Within is the story of Saint Justin, whose amputation becomes a key motif: Chet loses his own hand and finds another; his own appears mysteriously under Ed's pillow.  Only by praying for forgiveness for his adultery and by murdering his lover is Chet's hand miraculously restored.  According to the Lives of the Saints, the fictional Saint Justin severed his own hand, but in another version Brown presents, Justin's wife cuts it off with a woodaxe when she catches her husband masturbating after rejecting her advances.  Despite Saint Justin's story's exposure to the reader as a fraud, Chet's faith in the official version restores his severed hand.  The altered ending from 1992 has both Josie and Chet reunited in Hell, and the ghost of Chet's sister becomes a devil.  As Brown mixes surreal sacrilege with the sort of moralism that compels him to condemn Josie for her bloody revenge, Brian Evenson calls Brown ""deft at muddying the waters in a way that makes it very hard to pin him down as either belieever or satirist, as either anti-religionist or apologist"".

While not part of the Ed story, Brown had been serializing straight adaptations in Yummy Fur of the Gospels of Mark and of Matthew during most of Ed'''s run.  R. Fiore called these adaptations ""the best exploration of Christian mythology since Justin Green's Binky Brown"", comparing Chet's excessive Christian guilt with the ""almost childlike retelling"" of Mark.  Yummy Fur readers also found ""I Live in the Bottomless Pit"", a short strip in which a man discovers the Antichrist, who after millennia underground has forgotten his mission—a paradoxical one, as he states his orders were from God.Ed prominently features transgressive content including nudity, graphic violence, racist imagery, blasphemy, and profanity.  Brown grew up in a strictly Baptist household in which he was not allowed to swear, as depicted in Brown's graphic novel I Never Liked You (1994).  Brown challenged his own anxieties by tackling subjects such as scatological humour.  Imagery such as the recurring Pygmy characters and their ""ooga booga"" language, Chris Lanier asserted, reinforce ""old colonial imaging of 'third world natives.

Style

According to comics historian John Bell, ""Brown arrived in print almost fully formed as an artist"".  His style, while showing the influence of artists such as Robert Crumb, Harold Gray, and Jack Kirby, was distinct from his predecessors.  He continued to mature as an artist and draughtsman throughout the run of Ed, showing enormous growth from the beginning to end of the graphic novel.

Unlike most cartoonists, Brown does not compose his pages, but draws each panel on separate sheets of paper and assembles them into pages afterwards.  The panels in Ed were on  squares of cheap typewriter paper, which he placed on a block of wood on his lap in lieu of a drawing board.  He used a number of different drawing tools, including Rapidograph technical pens, markers, crowquill pens and ink brushes.  He had some photocopies printed from his pencilled work, which he found both faster to produce and more spontaneous in feel.

Brown worked freely, without ruling lines or lettering.  Usually he roughly sketched the artwork with a light blue pencil, then elaborated it with an HB pencil, at which stage he has said ""most of the work  done"".  Brown inked the pre-Vortex stories with a brush; when he committed himself to a regular schedule, he felt inking with a brush would be too slow, and switched to cheap markers or pencils to increase his productivity.  He continued to use a brush to fill in blacks and to letter his dialogue balloons.  Brown came to favour the quality of the brush again toward the end of the story's run, but found it slow to work with and thus used it less than he would have preferred.  By photocopying before sending the artwork to the printer, Brown could ensure that the copy printed from was sufficiently black.

While he occasionally scripted certain pages or scenes, more frequently he did not, and often wrote dialogue only after having drawn the artwork.  Brown did not plan out the stories, though he might have certain ideas prepared.  Some ideas he found carried him for up to two to three issues of Yummy Fur.  Brown used of flashback scenes different perspectives to alter the story to his needs—for example, when Brown revisited the scene of Josie's murder, he placed Ed behind a bush, linking the two characters' fates.  When he had originally done the murder scene, he says he did not ""know that Ed was over in the bushes a couple feet away"".

Brown found himself dissatisfied with much of the work, and later abandoning about a hundred printed pages which he intends not to have reprinted.  He found that the improvisational method did not work well with Underwater in the 1990s; after cancelling that series he turned to carefully scripting out his stories, beginning with Louis Riel.

Influences

When Brown started Ed, he was largely influenced by the comics he had grown up with, especially monster stories from Marvel Comics such as Werewolf by Night and Frankenstein's Monster by artists such as Mike Ploog, and from DC Comics such as Swamp Thing by artists such as Bernie Wrightson and Jim Aparo.

Since graduating from high school, Brown had been inching towards underground comix, starting with the work of Richard Corben and especially Moebius in Heavy Metal, and eventually getting over his disgust over Robert Crumb's sex-laden comics to become a huge fan of the Zap and Weirdo artist.  He says the book that finally pulled him over into the underground was The Apex Treasury of Underground Comics, which included Crumb as well as Art Spiegelman's original short  story.  He was also affected by Will Eisner's graphic novel, A Contract with God.  Brown had already been an Eisner fan, but this book was different, ""something that wasn't about a character with a mask on his face"".  He started drawing in a more underground style, and submitting work to Raw, Last Gasp and Fantagraphics.  The work was rejected from these publishers for one reason or another, and Brown was eventually convinced by his friend Kris Nakamura, who was active in the Toronto small press scene, to take it and self-publish it.  His minicomic, Yummy Fur, was the result, and included the earliest instalments of the Ed the Happy Clown story.

The book also drew inspiration from pulp science fiction, religious literature and television clichés.  Harold Gray's comic strip Little Orphan Annie had an effect on Brown after he discovered some Annie reprint books in the early 1980s.  This was to be a primary influence on later work of Brown's such as Louis Riel.

Publication

The story began in July 1983 in the second issue of Brown's original Yummy Fur minicomic, the seven issues of which were reprinted in 1986–87 in the first three issues of the Vortex Comics-published Yummy Fur.  Ed ran in the first eighteen issues of Yummy Fur, along other features, such as Brown's Gospel adaptations.  Brown envisioned Ed as an ongoing character in the vein of Marvel and DC comic-book characters.  In the late 1980s he came to feel restricted by the character; inspired by the revealing autobiographical work of Julie Doucet and Joe Matt and the simple cartooning of fellow Toronto cartoonist Seth, Brown turned to autobiography.

While Ed was the main feature of Yummy Fur until Brown switched to autobiographical comics in 1990, it was juxtaposed against straight adaptations of the gospels of Mark and Matthew, which filled up the rest of the Yummy Fur issues starting with issue 4.

In 2004 Brown set to work on a revised Ed; he pencilled a number of pages, but stopped when he came to believe the new version was no better than the original.  Drawn & Quarterly—Brown's publisher since 1991—reissued the contents of the Definitive Ed collection in a nine issue series on smaller-sized pages from 2005 to 2006 titled Ed the Happy Clown, with new covers, previously unpublished art and extensive commentary by Brown.  The contents came mainly from issues two through twelve, and some from issue seventeen.  About 80 pages—a third of the original Ed material—remains uncollected, including the entire 24-page ending that appeared in issue eighteen.

The first collection, Ed the Happy Clown: A Yummy Fur Book, appeared in 1989 from Vortex Comics before Brown decided to end the story.  It collects the Ed stories up to the twelfth issue of Yummy Fur and includes a cartoon foreword scripted by Harvey Pekar and drawn by Brown.  It was this edition that in 1990 won Brown one of his two Harvey Awards, for Best Graphic Album, and a UK Comic Art Award the same year for Best Graphic Novel/Collection.

The second edition came from Vortex in 1992, after Brown had taken Yummy Fur to Drawn & Quarterly.  Bill Marks had it labelled The Definitive Ed Book for marketing reasons.  The edition reprinted what was in the first edition with an altered ending and some material from Yummy Fur 17, and excluded most of the material in the series from after Chet's death.

In June 2012, Drawn & Quarterly published a third edition, Ed the Happy Clown: A Graphic-Novel, reprinting the contents of the Ed series of a few years earlier, including somewhat modified endnotes and annotations.  It had a new introduction by Brown, replacing those by Pekar and Solomos in the previous editions.  Compared to those editions, it was printed on higher-quality paper with higher contrast in the printing, and the artwork was reduced in size.  Brown subtitled the book with a hyphen: ""graphic-novel"".  This reflects Brown's distaste yet reluctant acceptance of the term, as its usage had by then become widespread.  Brian Evenson sees this as a Brown-like eccentricity and a gesture emphasizing the equal importance Brown places on both word and image.  The book was a bestseller.

The 2012 edition also included a ten-page story called ""The Door"", which Brown redrew from an anonymous public domain story from a horror comic book.  In the story, a couple go through a door in a funhouse which leads through a passage in which they get lost for years.  Their clothes disintegrate over that time, exposing their genitals, until they finally come across another door—one that leads them to Hell.  Brown wrote he found the original story truly horrifying, as the couple had done nothing apparent to deserve their fate.  He had originally intended to incorporate it into the Ed story, but capriciously veered off in another narrative direction.

The artwork appeared at its largest in the Vortex Yummy Fur issues; it was somewhat smaller in the minicomics and first two collected editions.  The artwork was smallest in the 2012 Drawn & Quarterly edition, a size Brown considered ideal, stating, ""The smaller the better, as long as the words are still legible.""  The 2012 edition also had wider page margins and gutters between the images.

Reception and legacyEd was seen by many critics a high point of the early alternative comics scene in the 1980s, echoes of which can be seen in such later surrealistic graphics novels as Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron by Daniel Clowes and Black Hole by Charles Burns.  The story won praise from The Comics Journal and mainstream publications such as The Village Voice and Rolling Stone, which placed Ed on an early-1990s ""Hot"" list.  Time placed Ed at seventh on its list of ""All Time Top Ten Graphic Novels"",  while publisher and critic Kim Thompson placed Ed 27th on his top 100 comics of the 20th Century, and editor and critic Tom Spurgeon called Ed ""one of the three best alt-comix serials of all time"".  The book appeared in Gene Kannenberg's 500 Essential Graphic Novels (2008).Ed had a large impact on a number of Brown's contemporaries, including fellow Canadians Dave Sim and Seth, the latter of whom was taken in by the ambitiousness of Brown's storytelling, saying ""Those brilliant sequences where he would show a situation and then return to it later from a different perspective, like the death of Josie, really blew me away""—and Dave Cooper, who called Ed ""the most perfect book ever"".  Others who cite Ed as an influence on their work include Daniel Clowes, Chris Ware, Craig Thompson, Matt Madden, Eric Reynolds and the Canadian cartoonists Alex Fellows, whose Canvas shows the influence of Ed, and Bryan Lee O'Malley, who calls Brown ""a Golden God"" and whose Lost at Sea was heavily influenced by Ed.  Anders Nilsen calls Ed ""completely amazing and one of the best comics ever"", placing it in his top five comic books, and citing it as a major influence on his spontaneous Big Questions.

Critic Chris Lanier placed Ed in a tradition that included Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron, Max Andersson's Pixy, and Eric Drooker's Flood!; he wrote that symbols appear with such frequency and importance in these works as to suggest significance, while remaining symbolically empty.  He finds predecessors for these works in German Dada and the Theatre of the Absurd.  Reviewer Brad McKay found Ed ""both hopeless and funny, a trick moviemakers like Tim Burton and Todd Solondz wish they could pull off more regularly"".

D. Aviva Rothschild likened the story to ""staring at six-day-old roadkill"".  Brown's father was too offended to keep reading after the fifth minicomic issue, ""Ed and the Beanstalk"".

thumb|alt=Censored comics panel of a man masturbating|Censored panel of a man ejaculating while masturbating in Yummy Fur 4

In Yummy Fur #4, there was a scene in which a fictional ""Saint Justin"" masturbates after putting off his wife's advances.  In one panel ""Saint Justin"" had just ejaculated all over his hand, his penis in full view and his semen-covered hand clearly visible behind it.  Vortex publisher Bill Marks had the panel covered up with another illustration after discussing it with Brown.  Brown agreed to this censorship, but was ""annoyed"" by it.  Marks later called it a mistake that he would not make again, and when Brown included a scene in the following issue of the Ronald Reagan penishead vomiting Marks made no objection, and all future collections of Ed have the original uncensored panel.  The censored portion of the panel was covered with a note delivered by a rabbit that Brown often used as a surrogate self; the message read:   Brown has said that perhaps 100 to 200 readers sent requests for the uncensored panel.

In stores, Yummy Fur was often wrapped in plastic with ""adults only"" labels on it.  It is not known if Ed or Yummy Fur were banned from any stores, but Diamond, the largest American comics distributor, stopped carrying it for a time in 1988.  A publisher discovered that boxes of its feminist publication were lined with discarded pages of Yummy Fur, included pages in which Chet stabs Josie while having sex with her.  The publisher lodged a complaint with the Ontario-based printer, which informed Vortex it would no longer handle Yummy Fur.  The third issue of the Drawn & Quarterly Ed series was seized at the Canadian border, but was later deemed admissible.

Critic R. Fiore initially found the 1992 ending disappointing, but changed his mind 2012, saying the sad ending gave Ed ""an emotional punch that it wouldn't otherwise have"".  Cartoonists such as Craig Thompson at first found the story off-putting, but later came to admire it.  Critic Douglas Wolk wrote that it is not surprising that Brown had not settled on one conclusion to the story, as that ""would mean some kind of narrative closure"", while Eds premise is that ""everything makes sense as a big picture eventually, but nothing can be relied on from moment to moment"".

In 2014, Uncivilized Books published Ed Vs. Yummy Fur by Brian Evenson.  The book details the differences between the various versions of the Ed narrative.

Canadian filmmaker Bruce McDonald has had the rights since 1991 to adapt Ed to film, for which he has planned to use Yummy Fur as the title.  Such a film could use stop-motion animation, but the project has yet to get off the ground.  At one point McDonald hoped to have Macaulay Culkin star as Ed, Rip Torn as Ronald Reagan and Drew Barrymore as Nancy Reagan.  In 2000, it was reported that the movie would have a budget of $6,000,000, but it was unable to get the financial backing.  A script was written by Don McKellar, and later with John Frizzell.

In 2007, the City of Toronto government commissioned Brown to create six weeks' worth of new episodes of the strip as part of their Live with Culture campaign. The strips were published in Now magazine. In one episode a zombie and his human girlfriend attend a screening of McDonald's still-unmade adaptation of Ed.

The aim of the act is to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace and drive a culture change. It was supported both in the House of Commons and the House of Lords by the Conservative Government, and was in the series of new employment law reforms of the 2022-23 session.

The act however faced significant opposition to its provisions by several Lords, which resulted in original clause 1 being removed from the bill for the act and the threshold for sexual harassment protections being lowered, both in committee.

966,30897,75860012,8836,A. K. D'Souza,"Andre Antonio D'Souza (13 June 1925 – 25 May 1978),  known professionally as A. K. D'Souza, was an Indian playwright, director, actor, composer, singer, and sailor known for his work in tiatr productions in the 1950s.

Career
During the 1950s, D'Souza directed tiatrs, a form of Goan musical theater, and organized a series of performances in Bombay (now Mumbai) and London. Among his popular creations were Dilolo Jurament (The Given Promise) and Hanv To Tarvotti (It's me, the Seaman). His rehearsals for the tiatrs in Bombay were conducted at his residence. D'Souza shared a close affiliation with Minguel Rod, a Goan singer and composer, as well as the trio of tiatr performers called Kid Young Rod, which was formed in 1947 and consisted of Kid Boxer, Young Menezes, and Minguel Rod. Described by the Tiatr Academy of Goa as a distinguished individual with a fine personality, D'Souza was known as a gentleman who maintained a polished appearance. Wilson Mazarello, a Konkani singer and historian, describes him as a relatively modest writer and director of Konkani tiatrs during the early days, but who consistently produced tiatrs at regular intervals.

D'Souza played a pivotal role in shaping the career of his elder daughter, Antonette, on the Konkani stage. It was through one of his popular tiatrs, Hanv To Tarvotti, staged at the Princess Street Theatre in Bombay, that Antonette made her debut at the age of 15. D'Souza himself had a maritime background and, with the support of fellow seamen from the P&O Company, had the honor of presenting his tiatr Hanv to Tarvotti in 1957 at Southampton. The performance featured the Konkani tiatrist and Bollywood artist, Miss Mohana. It was during this production that Antonette made her directorial debut under the guidance of D'Souza, who served as the writer.

Personal life
Information regarding the personal life of D'Souza remains limited, and few details are available. He was born on 13 June 1925 and hailed from the town of Goa Velha in Goa, which was a part of Portuguese India during the Portuguese Empire and is presently located in India. D'Souza entered into matrimony with Innocencia, a homemaker and singer. Eventually, he departed from Goa and settled in Bombay, where he and his wife established their residence. Both of their daughters, Fatima and Maria (later known as Antonette), were born in Bombay and subsequently gained recognition as singers and actresses in the Konkani theatrical domain. Antonette, in due course, married Romeo Mendes, a fellow Konkani actor and singer originally from Assonora but based in Bombay, and the couple had three children. Fatima, on the other hand, wedded Anil Kumar, a Konkani actor and producer hailing from Chandor, Goa, and they had one son together.

Legacy
On multiple occasions, D'Souza has been commemorated as part of the ""Somplolea Tiatristancho Ugddas"" program organized by the Tiatr Academy of Goa (TAG). This initiative strives to pay tribute to the contributions and dedication of deceased tiatrists. These events took place in June of various years, including 2012, 2013, 2014, 2017, and 2019. The program featured other artists such as A. R. Souza Ferrão, Tony Fernandes, Jephsis Hitler, Reginald Fernandes, C. P. Dias, Ulhas Buyao, Romeo Mendes, Anthony Gonsalves, Chico D'Costa, C. A. Gomes, and Eddison Fernandes. The commemorative events were held at TAG's Conference Hall in Campal Trade Centre, Campal, Panjim, and were attended by D'Souza's daughter, Fatima, who delivered an address highlighting the lives and legacies of several late tiatr artistes.

967,31271,5335740,19721,Tomislav Ivković,"Tomislav Ivković (born 11 August 1960) is a Croatian professional football manager, executive and former player.

During his playing career, which spanned two decades, he competed mostly in Portugal, appearing for five clubs including Sporting CP. Ivković was also a Yugoslavian international in the late 1980s and early 1990s, representing the nation in one World Cup and one European Championship.

In 2010, he started working as a manager. During his managerial career, Ivković managed Međimurje, Lokomotiva, Al Faisaly, Slaven Belupo, Rudeš, Inter Zaprešić, Željezničar and Borac Banja Luka.

Before becoming its manager, from January until April 2022, he worked as sporting director of Borac.

Club career
Ivković was born in Zagreb, PR Croatia, Yugoslavia. He started his professional career playing for hometown club Dinamo Zagreb in 1978.

In January 1983, following a fight with Dinamo's head coach Ćiro Blažević, Ivković was transferred on loan to Dinamo Vinkovci. 

During the summer 1983 offseason, Ivković returned from the loan and was back in Zagreb. However, the row with coach Blažević persisted and he was immediately sold to Red Star Belgrade during the summer transfer window, ahead of the 1983-84 season.

In 1985, Ivković transferred to his first foreign club as he joined Tirol Innsbruck from Austria, where he played until 1988. After short spells with Wiener Sport-Club and Genk, he moved to Sporting CP in 1989, and remained there for the following four seasons, rarely missing a game, although he did not collect any silverware.

Ivković's final years were also spent in Portugal, with Estoril, Vitória Setúbal, Belenenses and Estrela Amadora, before retiring in 1998. Prior to Estrela, he contributed with six matches for Salamanca's 1997 promotion to the La Liga, retiring finally at 38.

International career
Ivković earned 38 caps for the Yugoslavia national team, between 1983 and 1991. His first major tournament was UEFA Euro 1984 in France, where he was second-choice behind Zoran Simović: the nation lost all of its three group matches at the tournament, and his only appearance came in the second game, a 5–0 defeat to Denmark; during the same year, he also won the bronze medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

Ivković went on to start for Yugoslavia at the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy, appearing in all of the team's five games before they were defeated by Argentina on penalties in the quarter-finals: in that match, he became famous for saving Diego Maradona's kick during the penalty shootout (mere months earlier, he had already saved a penalty from the same player in UEFA Cup action, when Sporting played Napoli, and the two allegedly had a bet on the possible outcome of another penalty before their World Cup match, which the Yugoslav won).Ivković se sjeća SP-a: Safet Sušić se molio u kapelici, Maradona se nije usudio pogledati me u oči (Ivković remembers PS: Safet Sušić was praying in the chapel, Maradona did not dare look me in the eye); Index, 4 June 2010 

His final international was a September 1991 friendly match away against Sweden.

Managerial career
Starting in 2004, Ivković was the goalkeeping coach of the Croatia national team, during Zlatko Kranjčar's time as head coach. He left the post in July 2006, as the contracts of the entire coaching staff were not renewed after the national team failed to reach the knock-out stages of the 2006 World Cup.

In 2007, Ivković began his sole managerial career, first as an assistant manager at United Arab Emirates' Al-Shaab. Two years later, he had his first bench experience, serving as assistant manager at Persepolis.

In April 2010, Ivković got his first job as manager at Međimurje, in the 1. HNL. During his short one-month spell, the team recorded two wins, one draw and four defeats, eventually ranking in 15th position, out of 16 teams, with the subsequent relegation. After Međimurje, Ivković worked as a manager at Lokomotiva, Al Faisaly, Slaven Belupo, Rudeš and Inter Zaprešić.

On 18 June 2021, he became the new manager of Bosnian Premier League club Željezničar. In his first game as Željezničar manager, Ivković's team drew against Borac Banja Luka in a league match on 17 July 2021. Ivković's first loss as the club's manager was against Tuzla City in a league game a week later, on 24 July. He guided the team to his first win as manager in a league game against Posušje on 31 July 2021. In his first ever Sarajevo derby, Ivković's Željezničar lost to fierce city rivals Sarajevo in a league match on 22 September 2021. On 24 December 2021, he terminated his contract with Željezničar and left the club.

Three months after becoming its sporting director, on 4 April 2022, Ivković was named as Borac Banja Luka's new manager following Nemanja Miljanović's resignation. Ivković's debut was a 1–1 home draw with Zrinjski Mostar on 9 April 2022. He won his first game on 23 April, defeating Radnik Bijeljina 1–0 at home. Ivković lost his first game on 15 May 2022, with a 2–1 away defeat against Sloboda Tuzla. He left Borac in June 2022.

Executive career
On 10 January 2022, Ivković became sporting director of Bosnian Premier League club Borac Banja Luka. He left the post on 4 April 2022 to become Borac's manager.

The monastery was established by king Alfonso II of Aragon as the first Carthusian monastery in the Iberian peninsula in 1194. The reason was the recent reconquest of the territory of Catalunya Nova from the Moors and for which the Aragonese kings needed to repopulate the territory. The location proved fitting for the community which was seeking silence, solitude and nature. According to legend, when the Carthusian monks came into the region they met shepherd who told them that he had seen in a vision angels ascending a stairway into heaven into the clouds of the summit of nearby Montsant.

By 1218 the monks were well established and were gifted by Jaume I dominion and jurisdiction over the nearby villages of La Morera, Gratallops, Torroja, Porrera, Poboleda and Vilella Alta. The monks introduced viticulture in this region, resulting in first vines in 1263, and the villages form today the wine region of Priorat. Scala Dei's patron saint became the founder of the Carthusian order, Saint Bruno of Cologne, whose feast day in the first week of October coincided the beginning of the vine harvest.

The earliest building of the monastery is the church of Santa Maria which was finished in 1228. Together with it were built a first cloister, called Maius, twelve cells for twelve monks and several other buildings. Thanks to the aid of prince and patriarch Joan of Aragon, the monastery could build another cloister in 1333 and build twelve additional cells, thus doubling in size. A third cloister with six cells was built in 1403 with donations from Berenguer Gallart, lord of Puigverd.

Though the community lived mostly in silence, it was also in contact with the outside world. The physician Arnaldus de Villa Nova dedicated one of his treatises to the prior and monks of Scala Dei and bequeathed some of his books to them upon his death in 1305. Alonso Tostado, a leading scholar of the 15th century, was a novice here in 1444 before he was called by king Juan II to become his advisor.

Early Modern History
In the 16th century a rebuilding programme begun which continued throughout the 17th and 18th century, giving the charterhouse a Baroque, Neoclassical appearance. During that time the charterhouse became an important regional artistic centre, notably among other for the Escaladei school of painting. Among those painters were friar Lluís Pascal, friar Ramón Berenguer (died 1660) and Joaquim Juncosa. The later became a lay friar at the monastery in 1660 and became one of the most famous painters of Catalan Baroque. Juncosa painted several portraits and frescoes at the monastery, unfortunately all of them were lost in the following events. The monastery became also became an important centre for books. For instance, one of the only two Catalan cookery manuscripts, El llibre de la Cuina de Scala-Dei, dates to the first half of the 17th century and the book Commentariam in Ieremiam Prophetam by Andrés Capilla (d.1610) was published here.

Demise and destruction

In 1835, following the decrees of Mendizábal for the seizure of monastic property, the community was forced to leave their home. In the surge of radical anticlericalism, revolutionary mobs, incited by liberal agitators, begun burning convents, starting first in Barcelona but also reaching monasteries in the country side such as the Cistercian monastery of Poblet, the Benedictine monastery of Sant Cugat and also Scala Dei. Only one day after the monks left, the monastery was sacked and a few days later it burned down. Thus, after just two years the conventual buildings were nearly entirely destroyed. The surviving buildings were sold at an auction in 1843 by five families who founded in 1844 a company to produce wine, the Sociedad Agrícola La Unión.

Today

Since 1989 the ruins were donated by the former proprietors to the Catalan ministry of Culture. The monastery has been renovated in recent years and the ruins can now be visited.",2024-11-28,"['Priorat' 'Buildings and structures in the Province of Tarragona'

Prior to assuming power, the parties opposing the ruling Law and Justice-led United Right (with the exception of the far-right Confederation) were referred to as the Democratic Opposition () in the lead up to the 2023 elections.

The firmly left wing Left Together party originally planned to enter the coalition, together with the New Left party as part of The Left coalition. However, due to a number of key issues being left out of the coalition agreement, the party has opted to stay out of government but has also voted to support Tusk's government in votes of confidence.

Law and Justice politicians and some right-wing media referred to the coalition as the 13 December Coalition.

974,13605,75367825,13871,Humboldt Wagon Road,"The Humboldt Wagon Road, or the Humboldt Road, was a freight wagon road in northern California. Constructed in the 1860s, it connected Chico, near the Sacramento River, with Susanville, near Honey Lake, east of the Sierra Nevada crest. From there, extensions continued to the Humboldt silver mines in Nevada and the Owyhee Mines near Silver City, Idaho. The road was surveyed and financed by prominent settler John Bidwell and carried passengers, mail, and freight between logging and ranching communities of northeastern California. It also contributed to the settlement of the region and the displacement of the native Maidu population. Portions of the Humboldt Road are now followed by California State Route 32 and California State Route 36.

Route description
The Humboldt Road began in Chico at a site called The Junction, at the present-day intersection of 9th and Main Streets. It followed Little Chico Creek eastward, then climbed into the Sierra Nevada foothills along the ridge separating the Big and Little Chico Creek drainages. It ascended the mountains, passing through the communities of Forest Ranch, Lomo, Butte Meadows, and Jonesville, then crested the ""Big Summit” at  elevation near the Butte-Plumas County line. It then merged with the Humbug Stagecoach Road from Oroville and descended to Prattville, at the Big Meadows (now Lake Almanor). From there it proceeded eastward over rolling, forested terrain, crossing into the Great Basin at Fredonyer Pass, and into Susanville. At Susanville, the road connected with an existing road extending eastward into Nevada, from which it was possible to head northward to the Idaho Territory along the Idaho Stage Company's road to Ruby City.

The road got its name from the mining district in Humboldt County, Nevada, a source of much of its early traffic. Between 1865 and 1867, it passed through portions of Butte, Tehama, Plumas, and Lassen counties.

Early history
In the early 1860s, deposits of silver were discovered in the Humboldt Range of Nevada and in southwest Idaho. The transit of workers and supplies between these mining districts and California was difficult, due to isolation and the lack of wagon roads and railroads: To reach California, freight either had to be hauled over the dangerous and often snowed-in passes of the high Sierra Nevada, or shipped northward by a circuitous route down the Snake and Columbia Rivers, to the Pacific Ocean and down the coast to San Francisco.

Almost due west of the Humboldt Mines lay the city of Chico, California, which had easy access to steamboat shipping on the Sacramento River. Chico's founder, California Representative John Bidwell, recognized that his city could function as a hub for freight traffic to and from the mines, if a road could be built directly eastward to Nevada. Already wealthy from successful ventures in gold mining and logging, Bidwell aligned with other California financiers and put forth some $40,000 to construct the road, and in 1863 received a franchise to operate the highway as a toll road; the group incorporated the following year as the Chico and Humboldt Wagon Road Company. Construction on the road used white, Maidu, and Chinese laborers, who generally earned around $1 per day of work. Construction was complete by late 1864. The first tollbooth was about  east of Chico, near modern Forest Ranch, and charged $1 for a single horseman, $2 for a one-horse buggy, and $1 for each additional horse; the toll was later decreased to $0.75 for a two-horse wagon.

The mining boom proved short-lived, but passenger traffic via stagecoach quickly became popular on the Humboldt Road. Early attempts at stagecoach travel proved slow and dangerous, but in 1866 the newly-formed Chico and Idaho Stage and Fast Freight Company established rapid service, and by late 1866, stagecoaches could make the  trip from Chico to Ruby City in under four days, if weather was favorable—albeit at the steep fare of $60 per passenger (). The establishment of way stations for coach lines encouraged settlement in once-remote portions of California. This increased settlement put growing pressure on the native Maidu and Yana, whose numbers were plummeting due to disease and direct persecution by white settlers.

After the first transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, the Humboldt Wagon Road lost its importance as a long-distance route. It remained important as a regional highway, particularly to service the many sawmills and turpentine operations in the pine forests of Butte and Plumas Counties. A summer tourism industry also sprang up along the Humboldt Road, with mountain communities such as Butte Meadows, Jonesville, and (later) Lake Almanor building facilities for vacationers seeking to escape the severe summer heat of the Central Valley. 

Although the Humboldt Road avoided the highest elevations of the Sierra Nevada, it was still subject to heavy winter snowfalls that could block traffic for weeks at a time. The severe winters of 1873–1874 and 1875–1876, and a tremendous blizzard in February 1887, all caused significant property loss in the mountain communities along the road. In heavy snow, wagon freight had to be transferred to sleighs, drawn by horses fitted with wooden snowshoes.

In April 1883, the Chico and Humboldt Wagon Road Company’s operating lease expired. Responsibility for the road was then handed over to the county and it soon became a free public highway.

In 1897–1898, a major road improvement project was implemented, supported by county funds and citizen contributions. Though he no longer had an ownership interest in the Humboldt Wagon Road, Bidwell maintained involvement in the road's operations through the remainder of his life, and personally worked at construction projects along the road even into old age.

Later history and present status

The Humboldt Road remained an important highway into the automobile era. However, a segment of the road was destroyed when Lake Almanor was created in 1914, along with the original Prattville townsite and countless Maidu cultural sites. When the California state highway system was adopted in 1934, the portion of the Humboldt Road from Chico to Lake Almanor became part of State Highway 32 (Legislative Route No. 47), and the segment from Lake Almanor to Susanville became part of State Highway 36 (Legislative Routes No. 29, 83, and 86). The current routing of Highway 32 via Deer Creek Canyon opened in 1935, and the Humboldt Road from Lomo to Lake Almanor via the Big Summit became a county road once again. Highway 32 between Chico and Lomo was widened and straightened in stages between 1955 and 1970, moving the highway off the original Humboldt Road alignment onto a much safer routing.

Parts of the original Humboldt Wagon Road are still accessible to motor vehicles. The pre-1955 routing of the Humboldt Road remains a public road in the Chico area, and the route over the summit near Jonesville is a forest route that is open in summer and autumn months. Stone retaining walls dating to the 1800s and even wagon wheel ruts can still be found in the hills east of Chico, but are threatened by vandalism and growing residential development in the area.",2024-09-15,['Historic trails and roads in California'],"['wagon road' 'California' 'Chico' 'Sacramento River' 'Susanville'

History

The club was formed in 1925, making its bow with a 2–0 win over Stow Amateurs in October.  It entered the Border Cup for the first time in the 1925–26 season, and continued to do so until 1930–31; United only ever won ties in one season, in 1926–27, when victories over Coldstream and Leith Amateurs put the club in the final, at Ettrick Park in Selkirk.  United went down 2–0 to the Civil Service Strollers, the Strollers taking the lead through a second-half penalty.

Perhaps buoyed by this success, the club joined the Scottish Football Association in August 1927, entitling it to enter the Scottish Qualifying Cup.  However its debut in the competition in September was also its only match, a 6–1 defeat at the Strollers (after Johnstone gave Hawick the lead) seemingly putting the team off renewing its Scottish FA membership.

The club played in the East of Scotland League from 1926–27 to 1930–31.  However the club's record was poor, only once not finishing bottom (12th out of 16 in 1929–30).  It also lost every tie it played in the King Cup over the same period.

The club's final season as a senior club was 1930–31, and United withdrew from the League after 8 games, having lost 7 of them, and being replaced by Jed Arts.  United joined the Border Amateur League for the rest of the season.

United finished the 1930–31 season as runner-up in the Conan Doyle Cup, for amateur sides in the Borders area, losing to Chirnside in a final replay, having let slip a 3-goal lead in the original game at Galashiels.  The last reference to the club playing is in a Borders Junior League match in March 1932, by which time it was playing the reserve sides of the clubs it used to meet on an even basis.

977,41682,76171731,9342,San Martín barracks,"San Martín barracks (), originally Junín barracks (), was a military installation inaugurated in 1921 to house the Mounted Grenadiers Regiment of the Argentine delegation that visited the country for the Centennial of the Independence of Peru. Located the 13th block of the Avenida del Ejército, it was subsequently closed and auctioned in 2009 and demolished a year later.

History

The barracks were inaugurated by Augusto B. Leguía in 1921, alongside the adjacent avenue, as part of the projects carried out for the Centennial of the Independence of Peru. Named after José de San Martín (and originally after the battle of Junín prior to July 1921), the barracks were built to house the Mounted Grenadiers Regiment of the Argentine delegation that was visiting the country in its anniversary, with construction works beginning in 1918.

It was the first barracks to be built in what was then the outer limits of the city, designed by  and housing the army's engineering service (SINGE) from 1964 until it moved to the Headquarters of the Peruvian Army in San Borja District in 1975. At the end of 1942, a barracks building and horse stables were built, and service houses were built four years later.

In 1964, under the initiative of the National Institute of Housing, a 7.38 ha terrain used by the barracks' cavalry was ceded in order to build the Santa Cruz residential complex ().

On July 25, 1983, the installation was attacked alongside the Peruvian Investigative Police's headquarters in Miraflores (where two PIP members died), Kennedy Building (next to Miraflores Central Park), and the National Radio.

The 68,400 m2 barracks were subsequently auctioned due to their ""lack of historic value"" and demolished. Its sale to Pro Inversión had been considered since 2003, with a  almost being built in its premises in 2004.

979,23764,75662026,4766,Mount Tlingit Ankawoo,"Mount Tlingit Ankawoo is a  mountain summit in Alaska.

Description
Mount Tlingit Ankawoo is the highest point of the Takhinsha Mountains which are a subrange of the Saint Elias Mountains. It is located  west-southwest of Haines on the northern boundary of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. Precipitation runoff and glacial meltwater from the mountain's north slope drains to the Chilkat River via the Takhin River, whereas the south slope drains to Glacier Bay. Although modest in elevation, topographic relief is significant as the summit rises  above the Bertha Glacier in two miles (3.2 km). The mountain was named by a group of climbers led by Lawrence E. Nielsen who were exploring the Takhinsha Mountains in June 1966.Lawrence E. Nielsen, North America, United States, Alaska, Takhinsha Mountains, 1967, American Alpine Journal, americanalpineclub.org, Retrieved 2023-12-27. They made the first ascent of the north snow summit, but not the rocky true summit, failing two attempts. The peak's toponym is a Tlingit word meaning ""The Chief."" The mountain's toponym has not been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names.

Climate
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Mount Tlingit Ankawoo is located in a tundra climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and cool summers. Weather systems coming off the Gulf of Alaska are forced upwards by the Takhinsha Mountains (orographic lift), causing heavy precipitation in the form of rainfall and snowfall. Winter temperatures can drop to 0 °F with wind chill factors below −10 °F. This climate supports the Bertha, Casement, McBride, Garrison, and Willard glaciers surrounding the peak.",2025-01-06,"['Saint Elias Mountains' 'Two-thousanders of the United States'

982,31149,5334710,5467,"Biot, Alpes-Maritimes","Biot (; ) is a small fortified medieval hilltop village in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur near Antibes, between Nice and Cannes. Many people come to Biot for its renowned cubist art museum of Fernand Leger as well as the winding cobbled lanes on the elevated fort. This village, that is now known for its ceramics and glassblowing, dates to prehistoric times.

History

For a long period prior to 154 BC, Celto-Ligurians (the Oxybians and Deceates tribes) controlled the region. There was discord between the tribes and the town of Antipolis (Antibes), who then asked the Romans for help. Romans settled in Biot in 154 BC which they then occupied for five centuries, leaving behind monuments that are still here today.

The Count of Provence, who had authority over the region of Biot, donated the area to the Knights Templar (Solomon's Temple Catholic military) in 1209. At the time Biot was only made up of (today's tourist destination), The Place aux Arcades, the church, and a few homes. After purchasing and being donated land such as the Biot Chateau (a building still visible between Les Place aux Arcades and the Church Square), The Knights Templar consolidated the region of Biot. Biot remained a harmonious region up until the Revolution, which took place when Joanna I Queen of Naples took the throne, as well as the Black Plague. Biot was taken over by pirates and thieves in the 14th century. Both the Black Plague and the crooks were responsible for the destruction of the village. Biot became a refuge for the thieves. 
	
Biot was able to recover and return to its prosperous times in 1470 thanks to the King René of Naples who came to settle in Biot with advantageous conditions. In the 16th century, Villagers quickly enriched themselves with farming and pottery. Although there were a few invasions that caused damages to the town's crops, Biot bounced back on its feet and became a renowned center for ceramics. 
	
A few months before his death, in 1955, innovative cubist artist, Fernand Leger moved from Paris to Biot. Fernand Leger bought a villa, The Mas Saint André, located at the foot of the village right by a garden. Leger came to Biot to pursue the manufacture of his ceramics. His widow, Nadia Léger, and his close collaborator, Georges Bauquier, opened up a museum in 1960 as an homage to Leger, and to share the knowledge of his work. To this day, the Fernand Leger Museum in Biot attracts visitors.

They began on 23 April 2024 and were played through 8 May 2024. The top six finishers in the regular season qualified for the playoffs directly, while the teams placed from seventh to tenth battled for the remaining two seeds in a play-in tournament.

The winners of each of the playoffs series advanced to the Final Four, which will determine the EuroLeague champion for the 2023–24 season.

 Qualified teams 

 Tiebreakers 
When more than two teams are tied, the ranking will be established taking into account the victories obtained in the games played only among them. Should the tie persist among some, but not all, of the teams, the ranking of the teams still tied will be determined by again taking into account the victories in the games played only among them, and repeating this same procedure until the tie is entirely resolved.
If a tie persists, the ranking will be determined by the goal difference in favour and against in the games played only among the teams still tied.

 Play-in 
<onlyinclude>
Under the new format, the 7th to 10th-ranked teams faced each other in the play-in. Each game is hosted by the team with the higher regular season record. The format was similar to the first two rounds of the Page–McIntyre system for a four-team playoff that was identical to that of the NBA play-in tournament. First, the 7th seed hosted the 8th seed, with the winner advancing to the playoffs; likewise the 9th seed hosted the 10th seed, with the loser eliminated. Then the loser of the 7-v-8 game hosted the winner of the 9-v-10 game, with the winner of that game getting the final playoff spot.

 Matches 

 Playoff series 
Playoff series were best-of-five. The first team to win three games wins the series. A 2–2–1 format was used – teams with home-court advantage played games 1, 2, and 5 at home, while their opponents hosted games 3 and 4. Games 4 and 5 were only played if necessary. The four winning teams advanced to the Final Four.

988,24061,75673266,39353,SMART Health Card,"The SMART Health Card framework is an open source immunity passport program designed to store and share medical information in paper or digital form. It was initially launched as a vaccine passport during the COVID-19 pandemic, but is envisioned for use for other infectious diseases. SMART Health Cards include a QR code which can be scanned and verified using the official SMART Health Card Verifier mobile app, supported by Apple and Android. It was rolled out by the Vaccination Credential Initiative (VCI) based on technology developed at Boston Children's Hospital, and standards set by Health Level Seven International (HL7) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It is recognized by the International Organization for Standardization.

 History 

 Founding 
In February 2009, United States president Barack Obama signed an economic stimulus package which included $19 billion in funds for investment in health information technology. The following month, researchers from Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Kenneth Mandl and Isaac Kohane, published an article in The New England Journal of Medicine calling for the modernization of electronic health records through API integrations on mobile devices. In April 2010, the pair secured a $15 million grant through the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology's Strategic Health IT Advanced Research Projects (SHARP) program. With this federal funding, the researchers began development of an interoperable healthcare IT platform they called ""Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies"" (SMART). The first iteration of the platform API was previewed later that year, and ""SMART Classic"" was released in 2011.

In 2013, SMART adopted the open-source Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard developed by Health Level Seven International (HL7). The newly named SMART on FHIR platform was debuted in February 2014 at the Health Information Management Systems Society conference.

 21st Century Cures Act 
According to SMART Health IT, Mandl successfully lobbied for the inclusion of a universal API requirement in the 21st Century Cures Act, signed into law on December 13, 2016. The team also advocated for a federal rule establishing SMART as the universal API. In 2019, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology published the ""final rule"" specifying the SMART framework as the standard to satisfy the requirements of the 21st Century Cures Act; the rule was implemented in June 2020.

 COVID-19 
The SMART Health Card framework was deployed as a ""de facto standard"" for vaccine passports in the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and other international jurisdictions. On January 14, 2021, the Mitre Corporation announced the launch of a new public–private partnership called the Vaccination Credential Initiative (VCI) alongside the CARIN Alliance, Cerner, Change Healthcare, The Commons Project Foundation, Epic Systems, Evernorth, Mayo Clinic, Microsoft, Oracle, Safe Health, and Salesforce. VCI's purpose was to employ the SMART Health Card framework in order to create a unified proof-of-vaccination system for COVID-19 vaccines.The California Department of Public Health introduced a Digital Covid-19 Vaccine Record portal in June 2021, allowing individuals to verify their vaccination status using the SMART Health Card reader.

On August 5, 2021, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced the introduction of the ""Excelsior Pass Plus"" which would expand its Excelsior Pass program into other states and internationally by connecting it to the SMART Health Card system. As of August 27, 2021, 415,000 citizens of Louisiana had added their COVID-19 vaccination status to their state-run, SMART Health Card enabled LA Wallet. On September 8, 2021, Hawaii governor David Ige announced the rollout of the state's Hawaiʻi SMART Health Card. County-level health departments across the United States partnered with VaccineCheck to issue SMART Health Cards by verifying vaccine cards provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The Government of Canada spent CAD$4.6 million to develop a proof-of-vaccination credential on the SMART Health Card framework, enabling its ArriveCAN travel application to store, recognize and verify credentials from every province, territory and foreign country. Since October 2021, Canadian provinces and territories used the SMART Health Card format as a requirement by the federal government, including British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Yukon.

On October 13, 2021, the American Immunization Registry Association (AIRA) published a statement encouraging adoption of SMART Health Cards as a common standard ""where allowed by local law and policy."" ""SMARTHealth.Cards"" was listed as a supporting member of AIRA through the VCI.

A SMART Health Cards Global Forum was held on October 28, 2021. The event featured keynote speakers Andy Slavitt (former Senior Pandemic Advisor to President Joe Biden’s COVID-19 pandemic response team) and Mike Leavitt (former United States Secretary of Health and Human Services).

On December 20, 2021, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare launched its COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate Application using the SMART Health Card.

By January 2022, about 80% of Americans who had received a COVID-19 vaccine had access to a SMART Health Card through their state governments, local businesses, universities and healthcare systems.

992,35884,5348375,10039,Ray Cashmere,"Ray Cashmere (born 12 January 1980) is an Australian former rugby league footballer. He previously played for the Wests Tigers and North Queensland Cowboys in the NRL and the Salford City Reds in the Super League.

Background
Ray Cashmere was born in Kogarah, New South Wales, Australia.

Career
A Campbelltown junior at City Kangaroos, ESA, Collies and Macarthur Saints, Cashmere was just 19 when he made his début for a struggling Western Suburbs Magpies in 1999. A 56-16 loss to Canterbury Bulldogs was to be his only appearance for them. The club merged at the end of the season (joining the Balmain Tigers to become the Wests Tigers), seeing Cashmere sign at Parramatta Eels for 2000. The young prop would become the last former Magpie player to be in the NRL in 2012.

Disillusioned after a bad season at Parramatta Eels in 2000, Cashmere returned to his roots, spearheading Macarthur Saints to the Wests A Grade title. After a formative period playing in France, Cashmere joined the Wests Tigers midway through 2005, and was a member of the squad that won the premiership that year. He played 3 games off the bench towards the end of the season, but did not play in any finals matches.

Joining the North Queensland Cowboys in 2006, Cashmere gained a cult following for his particular brand of football, playing 54 games in three seasons with the club. He was described as ""one of most powerful front-rowers in the NRL.""

In 2008, Cashmere signed a three-year contract with the Salford City Reds in the Super League. Cashmere played 72 games for the club.

Returning to Australia in 2012, Cashmere signed for a stint with the NSW Cup team Illawarra Cutters. Early in the season, Cashmere sought a release to rejoin the Wests Tigers, a request that was initially rejected by the club. Cashmere said, ""I’m pissed off and my family’s pissed off - I can’t believe it. I’m bitterly disappointed and I can’t believe they’ve restricted me from achieving my best. The Cutters, a reserve grade team, have essentially stopped a bloke from having a go at a first-grade team.""

Cashmere was released to join Wests Tigers in April, the club keen to sign him after injury to Keith Galloway saw them playing with inexperienced props. Football manager Bryan Hider said he was, ""a guy who carts his teams forward. He's a monster type of a character, he's a big boy. So hopefully he'll do a job for us."" Less than a fortnight later, Cashmere made his return to first grade in a 30-0 victory over the Penrith Panthers, ending the club's 5 game losing streak. His return performance was said to be, ""by no means the catalyst for the win, but his move to the Tigers has certainly bolstered the club's decimated forward pack.""

Cashmere made 10 appearances from the bench in 2012, with Wests Tigers winning 7 of those matches. He was also a member of the Balmain Ryde Eastwood Tigers side that lost the NSW Cup grand final. At the end of the season, he announced he would be retiring from the NRL and would play for the Shellharbour Sharks in the Illawarra Rugby League competition in 2013.

After a season at Shellharbour, Cashmere signed at CRL Group 6 club, Camden Rams for the 2014 and 2015 seasons. Cashmere would spearhead the Rams to the minor premiership, before losing the Picton Magpies in the Grand Final.

Working in construction in 2016, Cashmere played for his junior club, the Campbelltown City Kangaroos.

993,40447,5360186,3964,Twin-carbon arc welding,"Unlike single-carbon arc welding, in twin-carbon arc welding (TCAW) the arc is maintained between two carbon (graphite) electrodes held in a special holder. The Ac current was usually used. It was switched on by operating bringing two electrodes closer by a mechanism which also adjusted arc length. The two electrodes touch momentarily, then separate and thus an arc is established. TCAW is unshielded and no artificial pressure is applied.

 History 

TCAW was first proposed in 1874.

 Use 

The size of the arc depends upon the distance between the electrode tips, electrode diameters and the welding current. The heat input to the job can be varied by changing the arc size or the distance between the arc and workpiece. After striking the arc, welding can be carried out in the same way as in TIG welding process.

An AC supply is recommended for TCAW. In case a DC supply is used, the positive electrode will disintegrate and consume at a much faster rate as compared to negative electrode, because two-thirds of the total heat is generated at the positive anode. This will produce an unstable arc and require frequent adjustment of the electrodes. In AC welding, because of alternate reversals of polarity, both the electrodes will be affected equally and present no problem.

The electrodes employed for TCAW are approximately of the same diameter as the workpiece thickness. The magnitude of arc current required for welding depends upon both electrode diameter and plate thickness. For example, an 8 mm diameter electrode will need about 65 amps to weld a mild steel sheet of thickness 3.5 mm and 80 Amps to weld a sheet of 6 mm thickness.

TCAW, though more complex than single carbon arc welding, possesses the advantage that arc is independent of the job and can be moved anywhere without getting extinguished. Moreover, the workpiece is not a part of the electrical circuit.

While carbon electrodes have been replaced by tungsten and other alternatives in many places, in developing countries simple twin carbon-arc torches are a cheaper and more sustainable alternative to oxyacetylene torches. A simple version of a TCAW apparatus was designed in Ethiopia, it has reduced costs and improved the accessibility of welding services.",2025-01-05,['Arc welding'],"['carbon arc welding' 'arc' 'graphite' 'electrode' 'current' 'TIG welding'
